Help as much as you can. What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was not seen as a viable heir to the monarchy? from the following article ? Pedro I's successor in Brazil was his five-year-old son, Pedro II. As the latter was still a minor, a weak regency was created. The power vacuum resulting from the absence of a ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II, once he was declared of age, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under Pedro II's rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888. Brazilian visual arts, literature and theater developed during this time of progress. Although heavily influenced by European styles that ranged from Neoclassicism to Romanticism, each concept was adapted to create a culture that was uniquely Brazilian. Even though the last four decades of Pedro II's reign were marked by continuous internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither Pedro II nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.","completion":"The person who was not seen as a viable heir to the monarchy in the article is Pedro II's daughter, Isabel."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Mark Prigg Researchers have uncovered a bizarre new type of 'upside down' sea creature they claim could give an insight into life on one of Jupiter's icy moons. The National Science Foundation team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, used a camera-equipped robot to survey the area under Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf. They found a new species of small sea anemones that were burrowed into the ice, their tentacles protruding into frigid water like flowers from a ceiling. Scroll down for video The new species of sea anemone, Edwardsiella andrillae, living anchored in the ice at the underside of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Researchers say researchers say it could hint at what life on Jupiter's moon is like. Many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding OPTIONS: - Antarctica, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. - Edwardsiella andrillae, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. - Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. - Jupiter, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. - Mark Prigg, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. - Nasa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. - National Science Foundation, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. - Ross Ice Shelf, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. - University of Nebraska-Lincoln, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life.","completion":"Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life. The fascinating discovery made by the researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln under Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf could potentially serve as a clue to what life on Jupiter's icy moon, Europa, might be like. The team utilized a camera-equipped robot to investigate the area beneath the ice shelf and discovered a new species of sea anemone named Edwardsiella andrillae. Edwardsiella andrillae are small sea anemones that were found burrowed into the ice and had adapted to live on the underside of the ice shelf. Their peculiar upside-down orientation allows their tentacles to extend into the frigid water, protruding like flowers from the ceiling. This adaptation serves as an excellent example of how life can survive in extreme and unusual conditions. Europa, one of Jupiter's approximately 79 moons, is primarily composed of silicate rock and water ice, and it is believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust. This vast ocean is estimated to be significantly deeper than any Earth's oceans, with a depth of up to 100 kilometers. If life exists within Europa's ocean, it would likely need to adapt to its extreme environment, much like the Edwardsiella andrillae found beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. Europa's ice-covered ocean is thought to be warmed by powerful tidal forces resulting from Jupiter's immense gravitational pull. Such tidal forces cause the moon's ice to flex, generating heat through friction. The heat generated by this process may, in turn, create conditions that would be favorable for the existence of life. Moreover, Europa's ocean is speculated to be in contact with its rocky mantle, which could generate the energy necessary for life through hydrothermal vents at the ocean floor, similar to what we find in Earth's deep sea. The discovery of Edwardsiella andrillae in the harsh Antarctic environment has potentially significant implications for our understanding of extraterrestrial lifeforms. This new type of sea anemone is an excellent model for studying how life might adapt to extremely cold and inhospitable conditions. If organisms can survive and thrive in such an environment on Earth, it's not unreasonable to think that similar creatures might exist in the hidden ocean of Europa. In conclusion, the discovery of the Edwardsiella andrillae sea anemone in the icy waters of Antarctica presents intriguing parallels to potential life on Jupiter's moon, Europa. The adverse conditions faced by these remarkable organisms provide insight into the survival strategies that life might employ in extraterrestrial environments. This finding not only highlights the incredible capacity of life to adapt but also serves as a reminder that the search for life in our universe is far from over."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"Older african american elementary school teacher props a book on a chalkboard.\\", does this mean that \\"Black teacher teaching history.\\"?","completion":"The sentence \\"Older African American elementary school teacher props a book on a chalkboard\\" describes a scenario in which an older teacher of African American descent is doing something specific – propping a book on a chalkboard. This doesn't directly confirm that the teacher is teaching history. They could be teaching any subject as the kind of book isn’t specified. To decode whether the teacher is teaching history, more context would be needed. For instance, if you knew that the book was a history book, then you could confidently say that the African American teacher is teaching history. Also, the action described is propping a book on a chalkboard. This action could be interpreted in various ways: they might be using the book as a reference, showing a picture from it, or perhaps using it as an object in a demonstration. The sentence does not explicitly say that the teacher is actively teaching at that moment. Moreover, the phase \\"elder African American elementary school teacher\\" gives us specific details about the teacher's age (older), race (African American), and the level of students they teach (elementary school). But this doesn't specify the subject they specialize in. So, based only on this sentence, it can’t be definitively stated that the Black teacher is teaching history. Further explicit information would be needed to affirm this conclusion. Meanwhile, it would also be important to refrain from making assumptions based on someone's ethnicity or race. Ensuring accuracy in interpretation requires careful consideration of the details given without predispositions or biases. In conclusion, while the teacher's actions involve a book and teaching aids (a chalkboard), it does not necessarily mean they are teaching history. It could be any subject ranging from literature to science. More specific details about the subject matter or the book’s content would make the interpretation more precise and accurate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A: By 1139, Portugal had established itself as a kingdom independent from León. Does the answer correctly answer the question Choices: (a). yes. (b). no.","completion":"A: Portugal's journey to becoming an independent kingdom is a fascinating tale marked with battles, treaties, and rulers. The process that led to its emergence as a separate entity can be traced back to the late 11th century, with the creation of the County of Portugal as a fiefdom within the Kingdom of León. The definitive turning point that would lay the foundations for Portugal's independence came during the reign of Count Afonso Henriques. Born in 1109, he was the son of Count Henry of Burgundy, a French nobleman, and Teresa of León, an illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso VI of León and Castile. Afonso Henriques was brought up as a noble and later took on the task of expanding the territories under his family's control. The Battle of São Mamede, fought on June 24, 1128, was a critical moment in his endeavor to carve out an independent realm. Afonso Henriques, who was only around 19 years old at the time, rebelled against his mother's governance of the County of Portugal. He successfully defeated her forces and took control of the county. This served as a major catalyst for his eventual push for complete autonomy. Afonso waited until the political climate was favorable to declare Portugal's independence. This opportunity arose after King Alfonso VII of León and Castile was preoccupied with securing the crown of the fractured Kingdom of Castile, which had been invaded by the Kingdom of Navarre. In 1139, Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself King of Portugal (known as Afonso I) and expanded his territories, engaging in a long process of skirmishes and battles against neighboring kingdoms, such as León and Castile. By declaring his independence and consolidating power, he created a strong foundation for a sovereign nation. However, it wasn't until October 5, 1143, when the Treaty of Zamora was signed between King Afonso I and King Alfonso VII of León, that Portugal's independence was acknowledged by a neighboring kingdom. In this treaty, Alfonso VII recognized Afonso I's title as 'rex' (king) and pledged to cease any further hostilities against the nascent kingdom. Even this recognition, though, would be formalized only in the Papal Bull 'Manifestis Probatum,' issued by Pope Alexander III on May 23, 1179. The path that led to Portugal's establishment as an independent kingdom was long and intricate, with several milestones that contributed to its journey. Nonetheless, 1139 stands as a pivotal year when Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself king and consolidated the foundation on which a unified Portugal was built."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step of the given process is: \\"Select a suitable core material, such as a soft iron or steel, for the metal piece that needs to be magnetized.\\" Justification: 1. Selecting a suitable core material: To successfully create a magnet through the process described, it's essential to choose a core material that has ferromagnetic properties (being attracted to or forming a magnetic field when exposed to an external magnetic field). Soft iron and steel are common choices, as they can be easily magnetized and demagnetized. Once the appropriate core material has been selected, the process can continue as follows: 2. Conductive copper wire is wrapped around the piece of metal: The wire is typically insulated to avoid undesirable short circuits when electricity is introduced. 3. An electric current gets introduced from a power source: The flow of electrons through the wire creates the basis for the magnetic field that will magnetize the core. 4. Electric current flows through the wire: As the current moves through the wire, it projects a magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the flow of electricity. 5. A magnetic field gets created in the wire: The cumulative effect of the magnetic fields from the individual turns of the wire creates a stronger, concentrated magnetic field around the metal core. 6. The metal gets magnetized: Under the influence of the focused magnetic field, the ferromagnetic core material forms temporary magnetic domains that align with the direction of the magnetic field. 7. When turned off, it is no longer magnetic: Once the electric current is discontinued, the magnetic domains of the core material return to their original random alignment, causing the magnetization to vanish and rendering the core non-magnetic again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which entity is this text about? Goldfrapp are an English electronic music duo from London, formed in 1999. The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer). Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. The band never intended to create dance music, however, previous releases were popular across nightclubs in North America and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Supernature debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the UK. As of February 2008, it had sold one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and \\"Ooh La La\\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording. The song was used for the iPhone 5S's commercial in 2013. \\"Ooh La La\\", the album's lead single, became Goldfrapp's first UK top five single. The song was chosen as the lead single \\"because it was up and in your face and carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album\\". \\"Ooh La La\\" became the first song performed by the band to feature the electric guitar and was cited as a highlight of the album by Allmusic. \\"Number 1\\" was released as the album's second single. Constructed around a synthesiser and bass arrangement, it was written about the importance of relationships. The album's third single \\"Ride a White Horse\\" was inspired by the disco era and reached number 15 in the UK. \\"Fly Me Away\\" was released as the album's fourth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors.

Sentence 2 states that the person no longer enjoys eating hardtack due to the memories it brings up. However, the first sentence does not give any evidence or information on whether these memories are positive or negative or how the person feels about these memories in relation to hardtack.

Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, FRSE (15 August 1771 - 21 September 1832) was a Scottish historical novelist, playwright, poet and historian. Many of his works remain classics of both English-language literature and of Scottish literature. Famous titles include Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, Old Mortality, The Lady of the Lake, Waverley, The Heart of Midlothian and The Bride of Lammermoor. Although primarily remembered for his extensive literary works and his political engagement, Scott was an advocate, judge and legal administrator by profession, and throughout his career combined his writing and editing work with his daily occupation as Clerk of Session and Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire. Scott's fame grew as his explorations and interpretations of Scottish history and society captured popular imagination. Impressed by this, the Prince Regent (the future George IV) gave Scott permission to conduct a search for the Crown Jewels (\\"Honours of Scotland\\"). During the years of the Protectorate under Cromwell the Crown Jewels had been hidden away, but had subsequently been used to crown Charles II. They were not used to crown subsequent monarchs, but were regularly taken to sittings of Parliament, to represent the absent monarch, until the Act of Union 1707. Thereafter, the honours were stored in Edinburgh Castle, but the large locked box in which they were stored was not opened for more than 100 years, and stories circulated that they had been \\"lost\\" or removed. In 1818, Scott and a small team of military men opened the box, and \\"unearthed\\" the honours from the Crown Room in the depths of Edinburgh Castle. A grateful Prince Regent granted Scott the title of baronet, and in March 1820 he received the baronetcy in London, becoming Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet. After George's accession to the throne, the city council of Edinburgh invited Scott, at the King's behest, to stage-manage the 1822 visit of King George IV to Scotland. With only three weeks for planning and execution, Scott created a spectacular and comprehensive pageant, designed not only to impress the King, but also in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised Scots society. He used the event to contribute to the drawing of a line under an old world that pitched his homeland into regular bouts of bloody strife. He, along with his \\"production team\\", mounted what in modern days could be termed a PR event, in which the King was dressed in tartan, and was greeted by his people, many of whom were also dressed in similar tartan ceremonial dress. This form of dress, proscribed after the 1745 rebellion against the English, became one of the seminal, potent and ubiquitous symbols of Scottish identity. In his novel Kenilworth, Elizabeth I is welcomed to the castle of that name by means of an elaborate pageant, the details of which Scott was well qualified to itemize. Much of Scott's autograph work shows an almost stream-of-consciousness approach to writing. He included little in the way of punctuation in his drafts, leaving such details to the printers to supply. He eventually acknowledged in 1827 that he was the author of the Waverley Novels.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Where did Scott find the Crown Jewels?","completion":"Scott and a small team of military men found the Crown Jewels, also known as the \\"Honours of Scotland,\\" in the Crown Room in the depths of Edinburgh Castle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Process: - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs. Question: suppose you Sit and guard your eggs more like a hawk. happens, how will it affect You will have less eggs in your nest. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"In the given scenario, if you sit and guard your eggs more like a hawk, it implies that you would be more protective and attentive to your eggs, similar to the characteristics displayed by hawks. This level of attention could primarily affect the number of eggs that are laid in the nest, which the question suggests may be fewer. However, the question also asks how this change would impact the second effect that was mentioned, which is having fewer eggs in the nest. Analyzing the process, the presence of fewer eggs in the nest is the result of the initial perturbation. This means that fewer baby birds would hatch due to fewer eggs being laid. As a consequence of having fewer baby birds, there could be some potential effects on the population. Notably, there would be fewer adult birds available to find mates and reproduce in the future, which could ultimately impact the overall bird population and its continuation. Now, considering the scenario in which you guard your eggs like a hawk, this behavior could have multiple impacts on the later stages of the bird's life cycle: 1. Increased chances of survival: By being more protective, attentive, and continuously guarding the eggs, you increase the likelihood of the laid eggs successfully hatching without being harmed or eaten by predators. 2. Higher quality offspring: With fewer eggs and more focus on each, the possibility of providing better care for the offspring increases, resulting in hatchlings that are more likely to develop into healthy adult birds. This could potentially offset the decreased number of offspring by increasing the chances of survival and successful reproduction of the existing offspring. By examining these potential effects, it can be concluded that the supposed perturbation will have a complex influence on the second effect mentioned (having fewer eggs in the nest). Guarding the eggs like a hawk could lead to more hatchlings surviving and eventually becoming adult birds because of the heightened protection and care they receive. However, there will still be fewer eggs laid in the initial stage, which might somewhat counteract the positive effects on the survival and growth of baby birds. In the end, this change will neither increase nor decrease the number of nest eggs, leading to an answer of \\"no effect\\" on the second effect mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Public Health England study shows hospital admissions for malignant melanoma increased from 11,157 to 14,475 between 2007 and 2011. The study also found the NHS is spending £95.5million treating skin cancer.","completion":"Title: Hospital Admissions and Healthcare Costs for Malignant Melanoma Surge: A Public Health England Study Introduction: Malignant melanoma, a form of skin cancer, has long been a major concern for public health officials worldwide. According to a study by Public Health England, hospital admissions for malignant melanoma have seen a significant increase between 2007 and 2011. Moreover, the same study also highlights the considerable costs incurred by the National Health Service (NHS) for treating skin cancer, which amounted to £95.5 million. This article delves into the findings of the study, the potential causes for the increase in hospital admissions, as well as the implications for the NHS and the public. Increase in Hospital Admissions for Malignant Melanoma: The Public Health England study reveals a striking rise in the number of hospital admissions for malignant melanoma from 11,157 in 2007 to 14,475 in 2011. This increase represents a growth rate of approximately 30% in just four years. The figures indicate that malignant melanoma has become a significant public health issue that demands urgent attention from healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public alike. Costs for the NHS: In addition to the worrying increase in hospital admissions, the study also uncovers the financial burden of skin cancer treatments on the NHS. According to the research, the NHS spent an astounding £95.5 million to combat skin cancer in recent years. This financial strain on the healthcare system can be expected to continue, if not worsen, given the rising hospital admissions for malignant melanoma. Potential Contributing Factors: Although the study does not explicitly identify the reasons for the upsurge in hospital admissions, it is worth considering some possible contributing factors. One factor could be increased sun exposure due to warmer climates, global warming, or changing lifestyle choices. With more people opting for outdoor activities and tanning, individuals expose themselves to the harmful effects of Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can lead to the development of malignant melanoma. Another possible cause could be heightened public awareness about skin cancer, resulting in more people seeking medical attention and getting diagnosed with malignant melanoma. While this may explain the increase in hospital admissions, it also underscores the importance of early detection, prevention, and treatment of skin cancer. Furthermore, an aging population could contribute to the rise in hospital admissions. As people age, their risk of developing various types of cancer, including malignant melanoma, increases. This demographic shift could, in part, be responsible for the observed increase in cases requiring hospitalization. Implications for the NHS and the Public: Given the mounting burden on the healthcare system due to the rising cases of malignant melanoma, it is essential that the NHS and other stakeholders devise strategies to tackle this public health concern. Early detection, prevention, and cost-effective treatment methods should be considered top priorities. For instance, the NHS could invest in raising public awareness campaigns about the dangers of excessive sun exposure and the importance of sunscreen use, skin examinations, and seeking medical advice for any suspicious moles or growths. Additionally, the NHS should work collaboratively with other organizations, such as cancer charities and research institutions, to identify innovative treatment methods and technologies that can help in reducing the costs and duration of skin cancer treatments. By doing so, the NHS could potentially alleviate some of the financial pressure and improve the quality of care for individuals with malignant melanoma. Conclusion: The marked increase in hospital admissions for malignant melanoma, as found in the Public Health England study, is a call to action for both the NHS and the general public. Addressing the root causes of this alarming trend and investing in preventive measures, early detection strategies, and efficient treatment options can help mitigate the growing burden on the healthcare system and improve public health outcomes in the long run. Collaboration among various stakeholders, as well as a commitment to raising awareness and investing in research, will be critical in this fight against malignant melanoma."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is mutually intelligible with Slovak, and it is the official language of the Czech Republic, as well as one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. The Czech language has a rich history that dates back to the 9th century and has developed through various historical stages, including Old Czech, Middle Czech, and Modern Czech. Today, the Czech language is widely known for its complex grammar, diacritics (such as accents and additional letters), and unique sounds that aren't present in other languages. Furthermore, the Czech language is categorized into four distinct dialect groups: Bohemian, Moravian, Silesian, and Cieszyn. These dialects primarily differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. Translation is the process of converting written or spoken text from one language to another. When translating a sentence or message, several factors are considered to ensure accuracy and preserve the meaning and context. These factors include the language's grammar, syntax, idioms, cultural references, and idiomatic expressions. For this reason, word-for-word translations between languages are often insufficient, and professional translators need to have a deep understanding of both the source and target languages to provide an accurate and contextually appropriate translation. In the case of \\"Message sent on channel part,\\" the translated sentence is \\"Zpráva odeslaná na část kanálu.\\" While the literal translation may appear to be a simple substitution of words from one language to the other, the process of translation requires a thorough understanding of both the English and Czech languages to ensure that the translation is accurate and conveys the intended meaning. In this example, the translation focuses on the correct usage of grammar and syntax in the Czech language, including the proper placement of words in the sentence, the correct forms of the verbs, and the appropriate use of prepositions.

With this new weapon in his arsenal, Luthor attempts to take advantage of the chaos caused by the potential nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Nuclear Man wreaks havoc on Earth, engaging in destructive battles with Superman. During their confrontations, Superman struggles to maintain peace and find a way to defeat Nuclear Man without causing more harm. Ultimately, Superman prevails, destroying Nuclear Man by tricking him into a trap that results in Nuclear Man's exposure to intense sunlight, causing him to disintegrate. Following his victory, Superman recaptures Lex Luthor and Lenny, returning them to the authorities to face justice for their crimes. In summary, Lex Luthor, with the help of his nephew Lenny, creates Nuclear Man to attack Superman and exploit the political unrest in the world. Despite their efforts, Superman triumphs over Nuclear Man and returns the Luthers to face imprisonment for their actions."},{"prompt":"My name is David. I am an English boy.

Q:Article: FOR people who are interested in space, nothing is more exciting than the idea of living on other planets. That might be why the movie The Martian (<<>> ) is so popular. It shows an astronaut struggling to live on Mars. But would it actually be possible to live on the Red Planet? While the idea of living on Mars is great, the reality does not look as good. Mars does not have a friendly atmosphere for humans. There is very little oxygen there. And because of its distance from the sun, it is also very cold. The temperature on Mars can be -62 degrees on average. This is much too cold for humans. However, scientists say it might be possible to live there even without a good atmosphere. Daytime on Mars is almost the same as Earth's. It means there's enough sunlight to grow plants inside safe buildings. However, they would have to grow in soil from Earth. Mars does not have a strong enough atmosphere to stop the radiation coming from space, which makes it dangerous to grow things in the soil. The radiation is also bad for our health. If we want to live there healthily, we need to build our homes under the ground or within the rocks on the planet. This would protect humans from the radiation and also some heat. When could we actually live on Mars? NASA is hoping to make some progress within the next 20 years. Question: It's possible to grow plants on Mars because _ .

News article: Florida governor Rick Scott in February 2018 (Reuters/Colin Hackley) Rick Scott, Florida’s popular governor, has a good chance of ousting a Democratic senator this fall. Naples, Fla. — Noted political handicapper Charlie Cook sees nothing but bad news for Republicans in the midterm elections. “If I were Republican, I’d be nauseous right now with what’s coming up,” he said on Sunday’s Meet the Press on NBC. But that’s not quite true. Cook’s own analysis of House races shows Democrats leading in 27 out of 55 competitive races, and only a slight favorite to win control of the chamber. And in the Senate, Republicans will get a big boost Monday when Florida governor Rick Scott announces that he will challenge 75-year-old Democratic senator Bill Nelson this year. Scott has won two highly competitive runs for governor, and his wealth means that he can partially finance an ad campaign in the ultra-expensive media markets of the state. Scott is the GOP’s best chance to win a seat that could decide whether the party keeps control of the Senate. The most recent polls show Nelson with less than a four-point edge. Advertisement Advertisement x But Scott has overcome much bigger deficits in the past. In 2010, he beat Alex Sink, a former banker, and in 2014 he beat party-switching former governor Charlie Crist. He won both races by a single percentage point. Both races featured charges that Scott was a heartless former hospital executive who relentlessly focused on job creation and economic improvement, at the expense of other pressing issues. Seven years after his first election, Scott feels vindicated for his laser-like focus. During his tenure, Florida has cut taxes year after year, seen the highest public-high-school graduation rates in 13 years, created 1.26 million private-sector jobs since 2011, and had the lowest crime rate in 45 years. Unemployment is a third what it was when he took office in the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown. Housing prices went up 15 percent in Florida last year, continuing the state’s recovery from a housing bust. Advertisement Scott also touts his deregulation record. “Burdensome regulations are the No. 1 reason our economy doesn’t provide enough jobs for everyone,” he told me at a New York lunch last year. “In Florida we have cut taxes, but ending 3,000 regulations is what’s made our economy take off. If I decide to go to Washington, I want to help President Trump continue to take the leg irons off of this economy and reinvent government.” Advertisement Scott says his persistent efforts to make Florida a business-friendly mecca have paid off politically. In 2014, he won 38 percent of voters under the age of 25 and the same percentage among Hispanic voters — two groups Republicans have struggled with. All this doesn’t mean that Governor Scott hasn’t fallen off the conservative wagon at times when political pressures have built up. There’s no doubt that Scott’s policies have left the state far better off than high-tax liberal bastions. In 2012, he reversed course and proposed expanding the state’s Medicaid program to comply with Obamacare. He was rescued from that folly only by his Republican legislature, which knew that Washington couldn’t be trusted with its end of the bargain. In 2015, he failed to appeal a court decision that made it easier for noncitizens to vote with impunity. This spring, he responded with alacrity to the Parkland, Fla., school shootings, supporting some of the changes advocated by gun-control activists. He embraced a bill banning firearms sales to almost everyone under age 21, and he opposed President Trump’s idea of arming school teachers. Then there is the state budget. Scott was a fan of budget vetoes in his first years as governor, but last month he signed a budget that included 4 billion in new spending. University of Central Florida professor Aubrey Jewett says the spending plan looks like a political document. “It is not consistent with what he had done,” Jewett told USA Today. “It looks like it is designed to help him run for the U.S. Senate.” Scott is unfazed by such criticism. The economic growth his policies have aided means that the state is strong enough to make “investments” in key spending areas, he says. Advertisement There’s no doubt that Scott’s policies have left the state far better off than high-tax liberal bastions. Florida gained 350,000 new residents, many of them economic escapees from high-tax California, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Scott says the liberal governors of those states are the best advertisements for their citizens picking up stakes and moving to Florida. Advertisement Conservatives feel good about Scott taking his record to the voters this November. Ron DeSantis, a Republican congressman who is running to succeed Scott as governor, told me this weekend that Scott will also be able to pummel Nelson, the Democratic incumbent senator, for his votes against Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and against the Trump tax cut. Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, says Scott can use the state’s prosperity to appeal to many voters who wouldn’t normally be reachable. A recent Mason Dixon poll, for example, found that even 59 percent of Democrats think that the state’s economy is on the right track. Rick Scott signed and kept the pledge against raising taxes for eight years. Even better, “he cut taxes each and every year of his governorship,” Norquist told me. “He always put taxpayers ahead of the special interests, and that’s a winning political formula.” ||||| Moments before greeting his supporters, who waved \\"let's get to work\\" signs, Scott gave his Facebook followers an early, if slightly unpolished, preview of the day's big news. As he made his candidacy Facebook official, his face was obstructed by a blue-hued slate that read \\"the program will begin momentarily,\\" and he garbled his words: \\"You’re the first to know: I am gonna run for the U.S. Senay—U.S. Senate representing the great state of Florida,\\" he said. Scott, sporting a U.S. Navy-branded baseball cap, went on to say that Washington \\"can work\\" and \\"must work\\" for Americans. \\"We're gonna make sure it works for Florida and for all of us,\\" he said. Scott's entrance into the race marks another key recruitment for the president, who for months has urged the Florida governor and longtime Trump supporter to run for the seat, held by Nelson since 2000. Trump considers Florida his second home and has spent most winter weekends as president at his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach. Nelson responded to the news of Scott's challenge Monday via his campaign Twitter account, saying that he has \\"always run every race like there's no tomorrow — regardless of my opponent.\\" \\"While it’s clear that Rick Scott will say or do anything to get elected, I’ve always believed that if you wake up every day and if you try to do the right thing, the politics will take care of itself,\\" Nelson said. In an interview with PoliticoMonday morning, Scott wouldn't cast himself in the mold of a \\"Trump Republican,\\" nor would he say if he wanted the president on the campaign trail with him. \\"I'm going to campaign for this job. I know there are going to be people that like what I'm saying. There are going to be people who don't like what I'm saying,\\" the Florida governor told Politico, which first reported the news that he would take on Nelson. \\"Let's go back to 2010. No one, I don't believe hardly anybody, endorsed me in 2010. Did that phase me? No. Whether they do or whether they don't, I’m doing what I believe in.\\" But strategists are skeptical about whether Trump will be a boon to candidates, like Scott, that he anoints. Past races in Alabama, Virginia and Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district have all seen Trump's chosen candidates felled by Democrats. \\"(Trump)'s his own brand, his own thing, and we’ve not really seen any evidence that him anointing you makes you a winner,\\" one Florida strategist with ties to both Trump and Scott told NBC News. Veteran political watchers have raised flags about Nelson's ability to keep his seat. Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report put Nelson at the top of his \\"most vulnerable\\" Democrats list, while pointing out that the movements on gun control in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting and teachers strikes across the country could provide momentum to Democrats in tough spots across the country. Those marches and movements are \\"all stirring up people that aren't in the Republican base,\\" he said. The gun issue is one that will certainly play a key role in Scott's race. Scott signed new gun restrictions into law last month — a response to a school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead. The measure raises the age to buy all firearms to 21, imposes a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases, allows trained school workers to carry handguns, provides new mental health programs for schools, and restricts access to guns from people who show signs of mental illness or violence. Another longtime Republican Florida strategist called that move \\"a self-inflicted ding” by Scott that could harm him with voters who strongly support the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment. \\"You don’t touch Second Amendment rights,\\" the GOP strategist said, while telling NBC News they still saw the race as \\"Scott's to lose.\\" Nelson, on the other hand, has pushed for gun control measures alongside students from Parkland, who have taken the national spotlight in their crusade for stricter gun laws from lawmakers both in Florida and Washington. ||||| If Scott’s past elections are any measure, he’ll likely tap some of his prodigious personal fortune. | Getty Scott running for Senate in epic showdown with Nelson TALLAHASSEE — Florida Gov. Rick Scott made his long-awaited Senate candidacy official Monday, setting up an epic battle against incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson and testing the limits of whether a close alliance with President Donald Trump is political poison or a pathway to success in the nation’s biggest swing state. Scott has never shied away from his friendship with Trump — who has repeatedly urged him to run against Nelson, Florida’s only statewide elected Democrat. And regardless of the constant string of White House controversies, Scott has distanced himself from the president only to the mildest of degrees. Story Continued Below But the self-made Scott, who was born poor and raised in public housing, then won the Florida governor’s mansion as a political novice, wants everyone to know that he’s his own man. “I consider myself Rick Scott. I don’t consider myself any type of anything,” the governor told POLITICO in an exclusive interview Sunday when asked whether he considers himself a “Donald Trump Republican.” As he launched his candidacy in Orlando on Monday morning, Scott positioned himself as an outsider. “Some people will tell you that as governor I never really fit in or played by the political rules in Tallahassee. Well, that is true. I never planned to fit in,\\" Scott told the crowd, according to prepared remarks. \\"And I won’t fit in in Washington either. It’s time to shake that place up. We don’t need another politician in Washington; it’s full of politicians, and that’s why it’s broken.\\" The Scott-Nelson matchup will be one of the nation’s most closely watched Senate races this year as national Republicans try to hold on to control of the House and Senate against an energized Democratic base. “I run on what I believe in. I’ve been very clear,” Scott told POLITICO on Sunday. “People ask me that a bunch of times, about ‘Are you this or are you that?’ No. I’m Rick Scott. I grew up poor. I believe in jobs.” That line is almost an understatement for Scott: The “jobs” message is the raison d'être for his political identity, born in 2010 when faith in the state and national economy was low and unemployment numbers were high. “Jobs, jobs, jobs” was Scott’s mantra in English and, during phone-banking campaign stops in Miami in 2010 and 2014, in Spanish: “trabajo, trabajo, trabajo.” “What I focused on when I got elected was getting 700,000 jobs over seven years and changing the direction of the state,” Scott told POLITICO. “And the business community has really shown up. We cut their taxes, reduced regulation, and we’ve added right about 1.5 million jobs.” Scott’s longtime confidante Jackie Schutz, who has worked on both his gubernatorial campaigns and is his outgoing chief of staff, will serve as Senate campaign manager. She said the campaign will soon outline a full plate of policy proposals but did say that pushing for federal term limits will be one of Scott‘s top priorities. Democrats with the Senate Majority super PAC greeted Scott’s likely arrival in the race by announcing Sunday they would embark on a “six-figure” digital ad buy featuring a video that recounted how Scott cut K-12 education by 1.3 billion in his first year in office, failed to expand Medicaid under Obamacare and was rocked by a Medicare fraud scandal that happened under Scott’s watch at his former hospital chain, Columbia/HCA, in the 1990s. “If he didn’t look out for you here, he won’t look out for you there,” the ad says of Scott’s ambitions in Washington. Many of those attacks have been unsuccessfully used against Scott in past races, and he now counts boosting education funding as one of his top achievements during his eight years in the governor’s mansion. Democrats are also trying to tie Scott to the deaths of 14 seniors at a Broward County nursing home after Hurricane Irma last year and a fatal pedestrian bridge collapse last month that killed six in Miami-Dade County. But unlike in his past elections, Scott faces a three-term incumbent in Nelson who has won a total of five statewide races over his career. And unlike in 2010 and 2014 — when voters punished then-President Barack Obama’s Democrats at the polls — Republicans face what could be an even bigger revolt with the party that controls the White House. Trump will likely be the biggest trump card Democrats play, considering the role the president’s lack of popularity played in three recent contested bellwether Florida elections won by Democrats in Florida’s 40th state Senate District, St. Petersburg’s mayoral race and Florida’s 72nd state House District. No governor in the nation has been so tied to Trump as Scott, who was one of the most prominent politicians to back Trump’s presidential run. He also chaired a super PAC for Trump that raised 20 million for him. Scott has often touted how his close ties to the White House have benefited Florida under Trump, who often spends weekends and holidays at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach County. Repeatedly, Trump has privately and publicly called on Scott to run for Senate. \\"I hope this man right here, Rick Scott, runs for the Senate,” Trump said last year after visiting Fort Myers and Naples, Scott’s hometown, to see firsthand the damage from Hurricane Irma. So does Scott want Trump to campaign for him? He won’t say. “I’m going to campaign for this job. I know there are going to be people that like what I’m saying. There are going to be people who don’t like what I’m saying,” Scott said. “Let’s go back to 2010. No one, I don’t believe hardly anybody, endorsed me in 2010. Did that faze me? No. Whether they do or whether they don’t, I’m doing what I believe in.” Asked whether he thought Trump would be an asset, Scott said “you guys are the pundits. You guys can figure that out. I’m going to campaign. I’m going to campaign aggressively. And I’m going to tell them exactly why people should vote for me. It’s no different from what I did in 2010. I told people from Day One, this is what I’m going to do. And eventually people came along.” Scott recently had a notable, although somewhat orchestrated, departure from Trump on offshore oil drilling. Scott pushed back after the U.S. Interior Department initially put Florida on the list of states that could see increased offshore oil drilling over the next five years. Days later, Florida was “off the table.” It was his first high-profile break with Trump, but Scott says he won’t hesitate to do so moving forward. “If it’s good for us, I’m going to support what the White House wants to do,” he said. “If it’s not good for Florida, I’m going to oppose. I’m not going to be a rubber stamp for anybody.” Most polls taken of the Scott-Nelson race show a tie, with many giving an inside-the-error-margin edge to Nelson. However, polling by the Republican-affiliated Associated Industries of Florida finds that Scott might be leading by as many as 7 points. “While it’s hard to envision any competitive, top-ticket race in this state being won by 7 percent, or 500,000 votes, as this sample currently shows the race, it is understandable why the governor has this lead on Nelson with such high job approval, image ratings and positive direction of the state under his watch,” said Ryan Tyson, AIF’s vice president of political operations. The group has raised money for Scott but built its early polling on a model with 39 percent Democrats and 39 percent Republicans, with the remainder having no major party affiliation. In a normal midterm, Republicans are assumed to have a turnout advantage, but there is a belief among many that an unpopular White House could prompt a “blue wave,” which has prompted the group to use an even-partisan sample. If Scott’s past elections are any measure, he’ll likely tap some of his prodigious personal fortune. He spent about 13 million of his own money in 2014, when his reelection cost more than 100 million. And, as a newcomer in 2010, he spent at least 73 million of his own money. “I’m planning on winning. I’m going to run to win,” Scott said in response to a question about personally financing his campaign. “I’m committed to raising the resources required, just like I did in 2014. I’m going to aggressively travel the state and tell people why they need to support me. But we’ll see.” One of the first concrete signs Scott was beginning to focus on the Senate race was the sidelining of Let’s Get to Work, a state political committee that he has used to smash every Florida fundraising record. Scott had stopped raising money for the committee, and last week filed paperwork with state election officials to officially sever his ties with the other committee. Scott’s focus had turned to New Republicans, a federal super PAC run by his longtime staffer and political adviser Melissa Stone. The committee is branded as pro-Trump but has quickly filled up on money from traditional state donors. The committee’s website previously included a Scott video and his signature on the homepage as chairman, both of which have since been removed. Once a formal candidate, Scott can’t legally coordinate with any super PAC backing his candidacy. While Scott’s jobs message has ultimately prevailed in his past two elections, he has and will face criticism over whether he moved the goal posts in promising 700,000 jobs in seven years. In 2010, he said the 700,000 would be “on top of what normal growth would be,” making it about 1.7 million. Later, he scrapped that talking point and took credit for the first 700,000 jobs, as well as the following 800,000. Democratic-aligned groups have started the “Rick’s Recession” campaign, focusing on a report critical of Scott‘s jobs efforts. Compiled by top economists for Florida’s GOP-led state Legislature, the report found that 36 mostly rural Florida counties had lost jobs since 2007, which encompasses Scott’s two terms in office. “A majority of Florida’s counties, especially those in rural areas, are actually worse off today than they were before the recession hit,” according to the organization’s website, which was set up by For our Future Action Fund. Scott won the counties highlighted by the group by a total of 130,000 votes during his reelection in 2014, a big number in a state whose statewide elections are often won on razor-thin margins. Scott’s jobs department immediately pushed back against the campaign in December, when it was unveiled. Administration officials said the group cherry-picked numbers rather than using more accurate monthly job reports. “As many Floridians choose to live in one county and work in another, using this information on its own, as the website chose to do, will paint an incomplete picture,” read the memo from the state Department of Economic Development, overseen by Scott. If Scott’s past two campaigns are any measure, Nelson can get ready for a barrage of negative ads like those that buried Scott’s previous opponents. Considering it could cost more than 3 million weekly for saturation TV advertising across Florida’s 10 media markets, the race could easily top the 100 million mark and perhaps hit 150 million — making it among the most expensive in the nation. Nelson is one of 10 Democrats running for reelection in states Trump won in 2016, and Washington Republicans are happy that Scott could help self-fund some of the cost to outgun Nelson, while Democrats are left emptying their coffers to defend the pricey seat. But for all of the talk of Scott’s toughness and his unexpected wins, Democrats point out he has won ugly and has never received 50 percent of the statewide vote, or won by more than 2 percentage points. As a governor, Scott has evolved politically. He has slowly shifted away from the hard-right tea party politics that infused his first run in 2010. Before his 2014 reelection, Scott reversed himself and signed legislation giving in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants who went to Florida high school students — often referred to as Dreamers — who were brought illegally as children to the U.S. by their parents. More recently, he moderated his position on offshore oil drilling. And, after being a reliable National Rifle Association supporter, he bucked the organization by signing legislation that instituted a first-ever Florida requirement that buyers of long guns wait three days before their purchase and be 21 years of age or older. On the eve of his formal announcement to run for the Senate, Scott even joked about his decision to challenge Nelson as the worst-kept secret in Florida politics. “You’re probably surprised, but I’m going to announce I’m running for senator,” Scott told POLITICO. “You’re shocked, right?” ||||| FILE - In this Aug. 25, 2017, file photo, Sen.

(AP) — Calling Washington \\"horribly dysfunctional,\\" Florida Gov. Rick Scott is challenging U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in an election that could be one of the most expensive and highly-watched races in the nation. The Republican governor was expected to criticize \\"career politicians\\" and call for term limits for members of Congress while formally announcing his campaign on Monday. \\"I admit that Washington is horribly dysfunctional,\\" said Scott in scripted remarks made available ahead of his announcement in Orlando. \\"Washington is full of old thinking. Washington is tired. And the truth is, both political parties share some of the blame. They've tried a lot of things - it just didn't work. But I will not accept the idea that we can't change Washington.\\" Scott is a multi-millionaire businessman who never ran for office his successful governor's race in 2010. He campaigned as part of the tea party movement and called for massive budget and tax cuts, but was forced to scale back his plans amid opposition from the GOP-controlled Legislature. He also changed his hard line positions on immigration. Scott is leaving office due to term limits, and had been urged to challenge Nelson, Florida's only statewide-elected Democrat, by President Donald Trump. Democrats have been anticipating his move for months and have ramped up their criticism, noting that Scott had been forced out as chief executive of Columbia/HCA amid a federal fraud investigation. Although Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, the health care conglomerate paid a then-record 1.7 billion fine for Medicare fraud. Democrats also plan to fault Scott over his record while governor, including his initial push for deep budget cuts to education and his back-and-forth position on whether to expand Medicaid. \\"Floridians will have the benefit of a clear-eyed view of a truly dismal record,\\" said Dan Gelber, a former state senator and now Miami Beach mayor. \\"Floridians won't forget the damage Rick Scott's self-serving politics have done these last 7 years, no matter how he tries to change his spots and obscure his record.\\" Scott's record on gun laws earned him an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association before the killings of 17 people at a Florida high school this year. Ultimately, Scott signed Florida's new law raising the age limit to purchase rifles to 21 and creating a new process enabling law-enforcement to seize guns from someone who is considered a danger. Scott took aim at Nelson meanwhile, contending the Democrat has \\"done nothing\\" in the Senate on high-profile issues such as gun violence. Nelson said Scott has not done enough -- he wants universal background checks and a ban on certain types of semi-automatic rifles. ||||| Just about everyone who follows politics closely knows that while there may well be a Democratic wave building, the Republican-friendly Senate map is an imposing bulwark that may protect the GOP against all but the biggest of tsunamis. Part of the reason that Democrats have 26 seats up this cycle is that they had such good years in 2006 and 2012. In 2006, President George W. Bush’s job-approval rating had dropped to 38 percent going into the midterm elections, mostly due to the controversial Iraq War, while 2012 featured President Obama getting reelected by 4 points, a bit wider than expected, but mounting what had to be the best organized presidential campaign before or since. This year, there are 10 Democratic Senate seats up in states that President Trump carried—including five that Trump won by at least 19 points—while there is only a single GOP seat, Dean Heller’s, in a state that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. Other than that, Republicans have to worry about their retirement-created open seats in Arizona and Tennessee. Democrats in Texas are making a lot of noise about upsetting Ted Cruz but the polling that shows the incumbent is in good shape is considerably more persuasive than the one survey that shows the controversial conservative with just a single-digit lead over Rep. Beto O’Rourke. There is no doubt that Texas is changing, getting less Republican because of demographic shifts, but it looks unlikely to change enough for Cruz to be upset in all but the biggest of Democratic tidal waves. So which states offer the best chances for each party to pick off a seat from the other side? From my vantage point, I see the best single shot for Republicans as being in Florida, with two-term GOP Gov. Rick Scott taking on third-term Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson. Sure, Scott has not indicated for sure that he is going to run, but I would be surprised if he didn’t. Florida is among the most-purple, most-competitive states in the country, and Scott would have the personal financial resources to run a first-class campaign even without raising money from others. Should Scott decide not to run, Nelson would instantly become a strong, if not prohibitive favorite, but I don’t think this will happen. The second-most-vulnerable Democratic seat is that of second-term Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri. Republicans have solidified behind state Attorney General Josh Hawley, avoiding what could have been a very problematic primary. With GOP Gov. Eric Greitens involved in a messy scandal, Hawley—as the state’s top law enforcement officer—will have to tiptoe gingerly around that, but he is an infinitely stronger candidate than Rep. Todd Akin, who carried the GOP banner six years ago. Second-term Sen. Joe Donnelly in Indiana is the third-most-vulnerable Democrat, and he might well have been higher on the list if Republicans didn’t face a very difficult and ugly six-way primary that includes Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, who loathe each other and are not shy about displaying those feelings. Mike Braun, a former state representative and wealthy businessman, and two others round out the field. Like McCaskill, Donnelly had a radioactive opponent last time around in state Treasurer Richard Mourdock. West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, in his second term, is the fourth-most-vulnerable Democrat. Manchin has a lot of personal strength but if Democrats were much less popular in the Mountaineer State, they would be a third party. Republicans have a tough primary that doesn’t help their odds any, between second-term Rep. Evan Jenkins, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, and the wild card in the race, Don Blankenship, the former Massie Energy CEO with a felony conviction to explain. Rounding out the GOP’s top-target list is Sen. Robert Casey, who is being challenged by four-term Rep. Lou Barletta. Pennsylvania, like Florida, is swing territory, but unlike Scott, Barletta doesn’t have the personal financial resources to compete in a very expensive state, much of his challenge will be to convince the national Republican and conservative donor community that he has a good shot. After those five is the keep-an-eye-out list of six: Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, Jon Tester in Montana, Debbie Stabenow in Michigan, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and Minnesota’s Tina Smith, appointed to replace Al Franken. The GOP lacks top-drawer challengers in each of these, so none are competitive today but should be watched. Democrats’ targets are far fewer. Heller is at the top of the list; he has to survive a Trumpian GOP primary challenger in Danny Tarkanian. Keep an eye out for Democrats to try to pull off a stunt like they did in Missouri’s 2012 Senate race, using advertising to help tip the GOP nomination to an unelectable Republican contender; in this case, Tarkanian. Arizona is the second-best target for Democrats but how the GOP primary comes out will make a huge difference. The Democratic nominee will be third-term Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. If the GOP nominates Rep. Martha McSally, a former Air Force A-10 combat fighter pilot in her second term, it will be a marquee race. But should former state Sen. Kelli Ward or former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio prevail, this race becomes a gimme putt for Democrats. The only other decent shot that Democrats have at this point is in Tennessee, with former Gov. Phil Bredesen. Republicans will have to wait and see who prevails between eight-term Rep. Marsha Blackburn and former Rep. Stephen Fincher. The state obviously tilts strongly Republican; the two questions are whether Bredesen can rise beyond that and just how ugly the GOP primary might get. Other contests may become competitive, but these eight seats, five held by Democrats and three by Republicans, are where the action is now.

You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. I am facing a new situation today: David was visiting Japan. First, he went to Fukushima where the recent nuclear plant disaster happened. He found the city still had very high radiation. Then he visited Hiroshima. He found that Hiroshima had some low radiation. Finally, he visited the capital city Tokyo. He found that Tokyo did not have any radiation. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which city a Geiger counter would click slower, Fukushima or Hiroshima? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in your background article and the situation with David, a Geiger counter would click slower in Hiroshima compared to Fukushima. Let's start by understanding how a Geiger counter works. This device is designed to detect ionizing radiation, such as alpha and beta particles, as well as gamma rays and x-rays. It has a tube filled with gas. When ionizing radiation enters this tube, it ionizes the atoms of the gas, resulting in ions and electrons that can carry electric current. The ions' movement causes the Geiger counter to make a clicking sound. The more radiation there is - meaning the more particles or rays that are entering the tube and ionizing the gas - the more frequently the Geiger counter will click. Now, let's apply this knowledge to the situation with David visiting Japan. During his visits to Fukushima, Hiroshima, and Tokyo, he found different levels of radiation. In Fukushima, where a recent nuclear plant disaster occurred, David found very high radiation. This would mean that in this city, the Geiger counter would very likely register a high amount of ionizing radiation, and so it would click very quickly. In Hiroshima, which saw an atomic bombing in World War II but has had much longer to recover compared to Fukushima, David found some low radiation. This means that the amount of ionizing radiation is less than in Fukushima, so the Geiger counter would click less frequently. Finally, David found that Tokyo did not have any detectable radiation. In this case, a Geiger counter would not click or would click very, very slowly. Therefore, comparing Hiroshima and Fukushima — the cities where David did detect some radiation — a Geiger counter would click slower in Hiroshima. The Geiger counter clicks are slower because the radiation level in Hiroshima is lower than in Fukushima."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Following a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, ministers proposed allowing anyone serving less than four years the vote. But the BBC has learned that they now want to limit the right to those sentenced to less than a year. The government was seeking legal advice over the plan, Downing Street said. But lawyers representing prisoners say anything less than full enfranchisement for all inmates would \\"almost inevitably\\" be challenged in court. The initial voting plans faced strong opposition from Conservative MPs. Prime Minister David Cameron recently said giving inmates the vote made him feel \\"physically ill\\" but warned that the government faced paying out more than £160m in compensation if it did not do so - a move which could be even more unpopular with the public than extending voting rights. 'Not arbitrary' At present, all convicted prisoners are barred from voting, but the European court ruled in 2004 that such a ban was unlawful. The government had indicated it was prepared to grant voting rights to all prisoners serving under four years. However, the prime minister is now thought to accept that the Commons is unlikely to vote for a proposal that could involve granting the vote to up to 28,000 prisoners, including 6,000 jailed for violent crime, more than 1,700 sex offenders, more than 4,000 burglars and 4,300 imprisoned for drug offences. Instead, the BBC understands that ministers are considering limiting the right to those prisoners sentenced to serve a year or less. A Downing Street spokesman said the government wanted \\"to ensure that the minimum number of prisoners get the vote\\". He added that a statement would be made \\"in due course\\". The decision to set a lower sentence limit for those voting is not straightforward and the government would have to prove in court that Parliament had not acted in an arbitrary way in choosing it. Lawyers had reportedly advised that a four-year limit would have been safe from legal challenge because it is the sentencing threshold for what are technically defined as \\"serious offences\\". However, ministers are aware that many of the crimes below that level - violence, sexual assault, drugs - will seem too serious to many. They are also aware that a one-year limit could be tested in the courts and that they might lose again. Any concession may not persuade many MPs who want to make a stand against the Strasbourg court. The Commons will have the opportunity to defy the court's ruling in a couple of weeks' time when it debates a motion tabled by the Conservative David Davis and Labour's Jack Straw. John Hirst, a prisoner convicted of manslaughter, had successfully argued in the European Court that his human rights had been violated by not being allowed to take part in elections. He told the BBC the government's attempts to water down the plans did not \\"have a cat in hell's chance\\" of succeeding. \\"If I'd have gone to court and said I'm not accepting a judge's life sentence where would that put us?\\" he said. \\"You have to accept that the law applies to everybody and it applies to the government, and David Cameron is not above the law and he'll find out that very shortly.\\" That sentiment was echoed by Sean Humber, a partner at law firm Leigh Day & Co, which is representing 550 prisoners suing over the denial of voting rights. \\"Any attempt to limit the right to vote to certain prisoners, while excluding others, is likely to be unlawful and almost inevitably lead to further legal challenge and claims for compensation,\\" he said. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \\"Removing the blanket ban on prisoners voting is not a choice but a legal obligation as a result of a court ruling. \\"Failure to implement the ruling would not only put the government in breach of its international obligations but risk paying out taxpayers' money in compensation claims.\\" Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan welcomed the government's \\"U-turn\\". He said: \\"The government should be standing up for the victims of crime but instead they are slashing police numbers and giving dangerous convicted prisoners the vote.\\" But the director of the Prison Reform Trust, Juliet Lyon, said the professionals running the penal system now felt it was time to enfranchise convicts. \\"It's been described as 'nasty medicine',\\" she told the BBC, \\"when it should be seen as people taking responsibility.\\" The voting rights of prisoners is a UK-wide issue and will affect Scotland and Northern Ireland even though the administration of justice is devolved. The Westminster government has said it will work closely with ministers in both regions before legislation is introduced. Read a selection of your comments: I am a former prisoner - 13 years inside - and I think some, but not all, prisoners should be allowed to vote. For example, those who are nearing the end of their sentence and are working in the community and paying taxes should not be excluded from the electoral system. Rehabilitation should be part of a prison sentence and prisoners should be taught how to be. Andrew Bell, Newcastle-upon-Tyne What a lot of fuss about nothing. You'd think the government had bigger problems to address. What difference will it make if prisoners can vote? The only problem I can see is if they were allocated to the constituency containing the prison, which might conceivably create a special lobby group. As long as they are allocated to the constituency they last lived in what possible difference will it make? For one thing, it is unfair that one person can get a suspended sentence and be able to vote, while someone else guilty of the same offence can go to jail and lose that right. Dorothy Macedo, London Imprisonment is the deprivation of liberty. The right to vote (as the American colonists taught us) is one of the clearest expressions of liberty. Therefore only those who have not been removed from society due to their own transgressions against their fellow citizens should have a say in shaping that society. Stuart Edwards, Hitchin, Hertfordshire I was sentenced to three months for drink driving, my first ever offence at 33. I served two weeks, I would never have expected to be able to vote, I was doing my time. I had extenuating circumstances (don't we all?) but come on, pay your taxes, be a citizen, you get the right to vote. People who do not serve their country well should not be allowed to vote, full stop. Anonymous Part of the punishment for convicted criminals should be that they forfeit the right to vote. The right to vote is not a basic human right, it is a privilege for those who live in a civilised society and accept its laws. By violating those laws you place yourself outside that society. The human rights legislation is one of the worst aspects of our European membership. Victor Bagnelle Snr, Lowestoft, Suffolk As an ex-prisoner I think it is perverse that prisoners are allowed to watch the X-Factor, yet are not allowed to participate in something constructive. It is interesting now that Jack Straw's career is winding down that we see his true colours; be it attacking young Muslim males or this 'throw away the key' mentality. R Steele, Shipley The right to vote in a democratic country is a basic human and universal right as a citizen. It is not subject to qualification by any government. Once that principle is ceded then dubious governments of every hue can claim the ability to set its own and safety; not to be subject to degrading or inhuman treatment, etc. Loss of liberty is the punishment for their crime(s), not the loss of their citizenship and human rights, amongst which is the right to vote for the government - which may determine the laws that effect/alter their sentence! Fr Ray Lyons, London Should prisoners be entitled to vote? Certainly not! They have been incarcerated for a reason, and in my eyes have forfeited any rights to the 'pleasures' that we law-abiding citizens enjoy. Giving criminals the vote (regardless of their sentence) is a slap in the face of the ordinary person. Daniel Everitt, Glenrothes, Fife, Scotland Prisoners are in prison for a reason, to be punished. They already appear to have life very easy - games stations, televisions, radios etc. They should not be allowed to vote as the whole reason behind prison, as said, is to punish and the right to vote is enjoyed by people who are free and law abiding. Did the criminals who want to vote think of the victims' human rights when committing the crime? I don't think so. Prisoners should have no vote, end of story. William, Northamptonshire The opportunity to vote has been taken away from the unfortunate victim of Mr Hirst so if I was him I would just be grateful that I was still alive and leave it at that. My opinion is when you commit a crime (especially taking another persons life) you forfeit your rights that the law abiding citizens enjoy.

The answer is:","completion":"In order to answer the question, we need to consider the air pressure and the concentration of oxygen at different altitudes. Step 1: Understand the cities' locations Pam lives in Dunder, a city at sea level, and Angela lives in Mifflin, a city in the mountains. Step 2: Consider the air pressure at different altitudes Air pressure decreases with increasing altitude. At sea level, the air pressure is higher than in the mountains. Step 3: Consider the oxygen concentration at different altitudes Oxygen makes up approximately 21% of the Earth's atmosphere, regardless of altitude. However, the total amount of air molecules (and thus oxygen molecules) decreases with increasing altitude. Step 4: Relate air pressure and oxygen availability to breathing When taking a breath, our bodies rely on air pressure to push oxygen into our lungs. At higher altitudes, there is lower air pressure, meaning fewer oxygen molecules enter our lungs with each breath. Step 5: Compare the oxygen intake for Pam and Angela Pam, who lives in Dunder at sea level, will experience higher air pressure and a higher concentration of oxygen molecules per breath than Angela, who lives in Mifflin at a higher altitude.

However, since Velveeta is a kind of cheese, it remains truthful to say that the woman is putting \\"cheese\\" into a bowl. 3. The action of putting the cheese into a bowl is explicitly mentioned in both sentences, which helps confirm the validity of the second sentence. The second sentence simply omits some details from the first sentence, such as the girl being blond, her pulling a funny face, and the specific type of cheese being used (Velveeta). Nevertheless, the core information, which is a woman putting cheese into a bowl, remains true based on the initial sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chill the mixture for a half hour.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"The Art of Preparing the Perfect Dairy Delight: The Importance of Simmering and Chilling the Milk\\" The culinary world is a vast one, brimming with a multitude of techniques and principles that enrich our dining experiences and broaden our palate. One such method, which often remains unnoticed but plays a crucial role in creating dairy-based delicacies, is the simmering and chilling of milk. Let's delve into this topic and explore its importance. An initial, imperative step to prepare a flawless, creamy, milk-based dish is simmering the milk. Simmering entails heating the milk until small bubbles form around the edges of the pot; it is not the same as boiling, where large bubbles break the surface. This fundamental difference is of great importance since excessive heat can denature the proteins in milk, resulting in a \\"scorched\\" flavor that can be off-putting. Simmering allows the milk to reach the ideal temperature, helping to extract maximum flavor without compromising on the texture or taste. Simmering milk calls for patience, precision, and a watchful eye. First, pour the milk into a suitable pot or saucepan. Turn on the heat to medium or medium-low, then carefully watch the milk as it heats. The key to successful simmering involves never leaving it unattended, as milk can easily boil over, causing a mess in the kitchen. Once you witness the formation of small bubbles around the edge and steam starts appearing, it is a clear indication of your milk being ready. The next distinctive procedure is chilling the milk mixture. The simmering process, as mentioned, optimizes the milk's heat exposure, enhancing its flavor. Following this with a chilling process sets it up to transform into a delightful, creamy dessert. After simmering, allow the milk to cool a bit, then transfer the mixture into a bowl or container. Chill in the refrigerator for a half-hour to let it cool entirely and to allow the flavors to infuse even further. The chilling process not only cools the milk but also helps in thickening the texture, particularly in the case of custards or puddings where this part of the process is crucial. The cool temperature slows down the molecular activity within the mixture, letting it thicken and rest. Chilling the milk also prevents the formation of a skin layer that can occur due to the heat exposure of simmering. In conclusion, the art of creating the perfect dairy dish is often found in the refinement of simple techniques, and these combined methods of simmering and chilling milk cannot be overemphasized. This process, though it requires time and attention to detail, will result in a luxurious and enriched dish. From the sleepy morning cafés serving a hot cup of simmered milk coffee to the skilled home baker crafting a meticulous vanilla custard, these fundamental techniques are being employed to create that perfect dairy delight. So, the next time you handle milk for a recipe, remember to simmer and chill; the result will be well worth the effort!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gauteng Province is geographically among the smallest, yet it holds a great significance as it is highly urbanized and densely populated - it hosts a substantial number of South Africa's population. Located in the north-eastern part of South Africa, it is surrounded by four provinces including Limpopo to the north, Mpumalanga to the east, Free State to the south, and North West to the west. Despite its small size, Gauteng is very influential, being an economic powerhouse not only in the context of South Africa but also in the entire African continent. Johannesburg, often shortened to Joburg, is the largest city in South Africa by population and is the provincial capital of Gauteng. It is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing a large proportion of South Africa's gross domestic product. The city is home to various cultural institutions and industries, entertainment sectors, as well as several skyscrapers, resulting in its nickname, \\"Africa's economic powerhouse\\". Johannesburg is best known for its diverse economy, offering sectors in real estate, retail, manufacturing, trade, and financial services. Its rich history related to gold mining is still visible manifested through the city's architectural designs and city planning. Since the discovery of gold in 1886 on the Witwatersrand, people from different parts of South Africa and the world flocked in Joburg making it a city with a mix of a multitude of cultures, languages, and traditions. Geographically, Johannesburg is located at 26.2041° S latitude, 28.0473° E longitude.

Whether what we desire is money or something else, we think we need more of it in order to be fulfilled. As a result, we begin to operate in fear and therefore don't give anything because we're afraid that we won't have enough. The result? Like the Dead Sea, we become lifeless. Life is meant to flow. when a pool stops flowing, it becomes stagnant . Stagnant water breeds disease and death. It can't breathe. It can't receive any more.

On the day his former employer announced a staggering £2.5billion loss, former Co-op bank boss Paul Flowers was enjoying an all-night drinking session, it has been claimed. The 63-year-old, who recently underwent a stint in rehab, allegedly invited an escort to his home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of last Thursday, admitting he was 'trolleyed'. The Co-op's loss announcement comes after its banking division plunged into losses last year with Methodist Minister Flowers at the helm. He was filmed by The Mail on Sunday allegedly buying class A drugs in November. In March he spoke about the drugs allegations, saying: 'I have sinned' and admitted to 'frailties' in an interview with BBC's Newsnight. Disgraced former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers (centre) with minders at Stainbeck Police Station, Leeds, on Wednesday. A male escort has spoken of being texted by the former minister as he partied on the day the Co-op announced record losses. The escort, 22-year-old Dale Westwood, claims the texts started at 1am and continued until 11am. The pair had met at a party in Bradford, West Yorkshire, last month. Mr Westwood claims Mr Flowers has repeatedly asked him to visit him, but he has always refused. 'I can't believe he has been so brazen. Most of the bank's failures are down to him, yet he doesn't have a care in the world.' Last week Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine. Flowers's solicitor Andrew Hollas said the former bank boss would make a 'full statement' following his appearance at Leeds Magistrates Court on May 7. The Crown Prosecution Service said it had 'carefully considered' a file of evidence against Flowers before pressing charges. The escort says Flowers blames the people who employed him for the bank's failures. Reverend Paul Flowers in front of the Treasury Select Committee in November, 2013. Mr Westwood added that Flowers says those who put him in charge were 'stupid' and was joking about the news stories surrounding him. He told the Sun: 'The Co-op are in a bad way and he doesn't recognise how he has been involved in that - he blames anyone but himself.' Flowers was suspended by both the Methodist Church and the Labour Party following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs. Last week Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine.

A separate review by Sir Chris Kelly, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life – an advisory Government body – is looking into how the Co-op Bank came close to collapse last year. His report is expected after Easter. Last week the bank announced a £1.3 billion loss for 2013 and launched an emergency plan to raise £400 million to plug a hole in its finances. There have been repeated questions about how Flowers was ever put in charge, despite having almost no knowledge of the banking sector. Last year it failed to buy 632 Lloyds TSB branches when a £1.5billion hole was discovered in its finances. Neville Richardson, the former chief executive of the Co-op Bank, blamed the banks’s problems on the way it managed its loan portfolio after he left, but the banker was contradicted by Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, who said the losses mainly derived from assets acquired when the Co-op took over the Britannia Building Society.

Context: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval.

Question: The closer the charged objects are, the stronger the electrostatic force. If we have a static charged balloon and bring it close to your head less or more hairs will stand up? Answer:","completion":"More hairs will stand up. Step-by-step justification: 1. When a static charged balloon is brought close to your head, the electrostatic force between the charged balloon and your hair comes into play. This force acts on the hair and creates a repulsive or attractive interaction, depending on the charges of the balloon and the hair. 2. According to Coulomb's law, the electrostatic force between two charged objects is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, F ∝ q1 * q2 / r^2, where F is the force, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between the charges. 3. Based on this relation, as the distance between the charged balloon and your head decreases, the electrostatic force between them increases. 4. With an increased electrostatic force, more hairs will be affected by the force and will either be attracted or repelled by the charged balloon, depending on the charges. 5. Therefore, when the static charged balloon is brought closer to your head, more hairs will stand up due to the increased electrostatic force acting on them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But they are not the same because question 1 is about friends just saying nice things, and question 2 is about your girlfriend not being honest and maybe liking someone else too. So they are close, but not the same. For question 1, what you can do is talk to your girlfriend and tell her how you feel. Say you know she loves you, but you feel uncomfortable with these other guys saying nice things to her. See what she thinks and maybe together you can find a solution. For question 2, honesty is important in a relationship. You need to talk to your girlfriend and tell her you saw something on her computer that made you feel hurt and confused. You need to stay calm and listen to what she says, and decide if you can trust her and figure things out together. Remember, it's normal to feel scared or worried sometimes, but it's important to talk about your feelings and try to work things out together."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What fruit is nicknamed the Alligator Pear????","completion":"The Alligator Pear is a colloquial term for the avocado, a fruit native to Mexico, Central America, and South America. The avocado, or Alligator Pear, belongs to the scientific family Lauraceae, and its scientific name is Persea americana. The avocado's nickname derives from its green, rough, and bumpy skin resembling the texture and appearance of an alligator's skin, as well as its shape, which is quite similar to that of a pear. The avocado has been cultivated for centuries, with evidence suggesting that it was first domesticated as early as 5000 BCE in modern-day Mexico. Over time, the cultivation and consumption of avocados have spread around the world, making them a popular healthy food option in various cuisines. The fruit features a single large seed in the center, surrounded by a soft and creamy flesh. The taste of the avocado is described as buttery and slightly earthy. Some people even describe it as having a nutty or grassy flavor. The creamy texture of the fruit is what makes it an ideal ingredient in various dishes, including salads, sandwiches, sushi, and, most famously, guacamole. The avocado is highly appreciated not just for its taste but also for its various health benefits. It is an excellent source of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats—both of which are considered healthy fats that help reduce bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and decrease the risk of heart disease. Additionally, avocados are also packed with numerous essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins K, C, E, B6, potassium, and folate. Furthermore, avocados are an excellent source of dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and contributes positively to overall gut health. They also contain high levels of antioxidants, such as carotenoids, which help to protect the body against free radicals and reduce inflammation. One of the reasons the avocado has become highly popular globally is its versatility in the culinary world. It can be used in various dishes, such as in sandwiches as a spread, in salads for added creaminess, or as a base in smoothies for a thick and creamy texture. The avocado can also be enjoyed on its own, with just a sprinkle of salt and pepper or a splash of lime juice. In conclusion, the Alligator Pear, or avocado, is a unique and flavorful fruit with a rich history and an extensive array of health benefits. Its versatile nature has led to its widespread and growing popularity, making it a staple in kitchens around the world. Its distinct appearance, characterized by a skin reminiscent of an alligator's and a pear-like shape, is what has earned it the moniker \\"Alligator Pear.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are many rights to make sure that people will be treated fairly when they are suspected or accused of a crime. Sometimes these rights are called \\"due process of law\\". In using these rights, a person should have the help of a lawyer. You have a right to protect against unreasonable searches and seizures. The police generally may not search you or your home, or take things you own, without a \\"warrant\\". A warrant is a paper which states, very exactly, the place to be searched and the things to be taken. Sometimes, however, the police will not need a warrant to search you or your property. If an officer sees you committing a crime, or if he has a good reason to believe you have committed a serious crime, he may arrest you and search you and the area right around you without a warrant. If you invite a police without a warrant to come into your house and he finds proof of crime, the evidence may be used against you in court. If you do not want an officer to search you or your home and he does not have a warrant, tell him that you do not give him the right to search. However, if the officer will not listen, do not try to stop him. It is dangerous to resist and it may be illegal to do so. Any evidence which a policeman gets during an unlawful search and seizure cannot be used against you. Police officers must act reasonably and fairly at all times.

People have several rights to protect themselves from unfair treatment when suspected or accused of a crime. These rights are part of the due process of law, and individuals should receive assistance from a lawyer in exercising these rights. One of these rights is protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The police usually need a warrant to search someone's property or possessions. A warrant is a legal document that explicitly states the location to be searched and items to be seized. However, there are certain circumstances where the police can search you or your property without a warrant: 1. If an officer witnesses you committing a crime. 2. If the officer has a valid reason to believe you have participated in a serious crime. 3. When an individual invites a police officer into their home without a warrant, and the officer discovers evidence of a crime. In cases where police officers conduct a search without a warrant, it's essential to explicitly communicate that you do not grant them permission to search you or your property. If the officer does not comply with your request, it's crucial not to resist. Resisting can lead to danger and may even result in legal consequences. Evidence obtained by police during an unlawful search and seizure cannot be used against the individual in court. Police officers must act reasonably and fairly at all times. They should only use physical force when necessary to enforce a law or arrest someone, such as when a suspect resists arrest.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that \\"thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it\\". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as \\"the most important piece of music of the 20th century\\".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being \\"murdered by that frightful butcher\\".

Over time, exposure to dioxin through air, soil, and water contamination posed severe health risks to residents, leading to the decision to evacuate the town in the early 1980s.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the question...what was the ford version of the el camino??","completion":"The Ford version of the El Camino is called the Ford Ranchero. The Chevrolet El Camino and the Ford Ranchero were both coupe utility vehicles, which combined the features of a pickup truck and a passenger car in a single model. These types of vehicles were popular choices for customers seeking a practical and versatile automobile with a stylish, comfortable interior. The El Camino and Ranchero shared many similarities, but they had several distinguishing features that set them apart as products of their respective manufacturers. The Ford Ranchero was first introduced in 1957, two years before the Chevrolet El Camino. Ford was inspired by the utility vehicles from Australia, specifically the \\"Ute\\" concept where a vehicle was designed to serve the needs of both farmers and business owners who required a combination of work and family car without having to own separate ones. The first-generation Ranchero was based on the 1957 Ford Courier sedan delivery model, which itself was a full-sized, car-based vehicle. This design choice provided a smooth, car-like ride and a comfortable, well-appointed cabin, making it a practical and stylish alternative to the traditional pickup truck. The Ranchero was produced in various iterations between the years 1957 to 1979, totaling seven generations. The vehicle evolved over time, adapting to different market preferences and the changing automotive landscape: 1. First Generation (1957–1959): Based on the Ford Courier sedan delivery and the full-sized Ford Fairlane, the first Ranchero boasted a stylish exterior, car-like ride quality, and high payload capacity. 2. Second Generation (1960–1965): The second Ranchero was built on the compact Ford Falcon platform, offering improved fuel efficiency and increased maneuverability while maintaining its utility and style. 3. Third Generation (1966–1967): The Ranchero now shared its platform with the Ford Fairlane, entering the mid-sized market with upgraded engine options and enhanced styling. 4. Fourth Generation (1968–1969): Ford's Torino served as the basis for this generation of Ranchero, which featured more muscular styling, improved suspension, and a range of powerful engine options. 5. Fifth Generation (1970–1971): Built on the Ford Torino Cobra platform, this generation of Ranchero offered high-performance engine choices and distinctive styling. 6. Sixth Generation (1972–1976): Emphasizing luxury over performance, this Ranchero was designed with the Ford Torino Elite in mind, featuring more comfortable interiors and an emphasis on ride quality. 7. Seventh Generation (1977–1979): The last generation of Ranchero was built on Ford's LTD II platform, maintaining the mix of utility and style that had made the vehicle popular. Throughout its production run, the Ford Ranchero was offered with a range of engine options, including inline-six, V8, and even some high-performance options in certain years. The vehicle's exterior design also evolved, influenced by the styling trends and preferences of each decade, such as the muscle car craze in the late 60s and early 70s. In summary, the Ford Ranchero was an American coupe utility vehicle and the Ford equivalent of the Chevrolet El Camino. It was produced between the years 1957 to 1979, and its design evolved over seven generations to meet the ever-changing preferences of its target market. Despite being discontinued, the Ford Ranchero and Chevrolet El Camino still hold nostalgic appeal to fans of these distinct and versatile vehicles."},{"prompt":"OPTIONS: 1). Yes; 2).

Etiolation is the process of plants becoming pale and weak due to a lack of sunlight. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 1. Sentence 1: \\"His etiolation signaled years in prison.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"etiolation\\" seems to be used metaphorically. It suggests that the person has become pale and weak, possibly due to a lack of exposure to the natural environment, indicating a long time spent in prison. Step 3: Analyze Sentence 2. Sentence 2: \\"The etiolation of celery.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"etiolation\\" is used in its literal sense. It refers to the process of the celery plant becoming pale and weak due to the absence of sunlight during its growth. Step 4: Compare the meanings.

Let's analyze these two statements in more detail to better understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"Soon people waited for several hours for her delicious dinners and boysenberry pies.\\" This premise establishes that the woman's dinners, including boysenberry pies, are quite popular. As a result, people are willing to spend a significant amount of time waiting to enjoy her cooking. However, the premise does not explicitly mention the reason why her food is so popular or how others became aware of its quality. Hypothesis: \\"Her delicious dinners had received glowing reviews on Yelp.\\" The hypothesis suggests one potential explanation for the popularity of the woman's dinners: they received positive reviews on Yelp, which is a popular platform for people to share their opinions about various businesses, including restaurants. It is reasonable to assume that positive reviews could lead to increased demand for her food and to people waiting in line for long periods. However, the hypothesis is not entailed or necessitated by the premise. The premise states a fact about people waiting for her food, but it does not necessarily imply that it is because of the Yelp reviews. There could be other reasons for the popularity of her dinners, such as word-of-mouth recommendations, local media coverage, or her participation in a highly-regarded culinary event. In conclusion, although the hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise, it is not directly entailed by it. The premise and hypothesis are related and could occur simultaneously, but the premise neither confirms nor negates the hypothesis; other factors could also explain the popularity of her delicious dinners and boysenberry pies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unlike Dennis, who held a pessimistic outlook on politics and those in power, Neil genuinely believed that most politicians were genuinely interested in the common good and that they primarily focused on the welfare and progress of their constituents. His faith in politicians stemmed from his upbringing and personal experiences, which had led him to conclude that they were, in general, honest people dedicated to making a difference. Growing up, Neil had observed politicians in his community as they worked diligently to improve schools, pushed for better healthcare services, and created meaningful job opportunities.

He felt that these individuals, although not perfect, put their heart and soul into their work, striving to represent their nation's interests and uphold democratic values. At the political rally, Neil excitedly listened to speeches, engaged in discussions with like-minded individuals, and took note of proposed policies that could significantly impact his community. For him, attending such gatherings was an essential opportunity to support those willing to invest their energy in making the world a better place, to share ideas, and to learn more about the political process and its nuances.

He felt that political rallies were nothing but dog and pony shows, designed to manipulate public opinion and reinforce an illusion of democracy. As a result, he consciously chose to boycott any event involving politics, disapproving of the approach that politicians, in his perception, took to deceive and control the masses. These contrasting beliefs on politicians' integrity and honesty set Neil and Dennis apart, leading them to take different paths when it came to engaging with the political sphere. While Neil actively participated in political discussions and social events, proudly wearing his enthusiasm for politics on his sleeve, Dennis focused on alternative means of creating change, such as volunteer work, grassroots activism, and joining independent organizations dedicated to specific causes. In conclusion, Dennis boycotted the political rally, not wanting to participate in what he considered a farce, while Neil attended and enjoyed the event, feeling that these gatherings were the lifeblood of democracy. However, despite their diverging views on politicians, both Dennis and Neil shared a common goal - contributing towards the betterment of society by taking action and standing up for their beliefs. This served as a reminder that, regardless of our perspectives on the honesty of politicians and political systems, every citizen has the power and responsibility to engage actively in the pursuit of a brighter future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dick learned that all the commissioned officers of the company with Wesley Boone had been wounded or killed in the charge near the stone bridge. Wesley had been with the prisoners at first. He had been struck on the head, and was in a raging fever when his father and sister came to the prison to take him away.

Carmichael died of heart failure at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California, on December 27, 1981, at the age of 82. His remains are buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Bloomington, Indiana. In 1986 Carmichael's family donated his archives, piano, and memorabilia to his alma mater, Indiana University, which established a Hoagy Carmichael Collection in its Archives of Traditional Music and the Hoagy Carmichael Room to permanently display selections from the collection. Carmichael is considered to be among the most successful of the Tin Pan Alley songwriters of the 1930s, and was among the first singer-songwriters in the age of mass media to exploit new communication technologies, such as television and the use of electronic microphones and sound recordings. American composer and author Alec Wilder described Carmichael as the \\"most talented, inventive, sophisticated and jazz-oriented of all the great craftsmen\\" of pop songs in the first half of the 20th century. Carmichael was an industry trailblazer, who recorded varied interpretations of his own songs and provided material for many other musicians to interpret. His creative work includes several hundred compositions, some of them enduring classics, as well as numerous sound recordings and appearances on radio and television and in motion pictures. Music historian Ivan Raykoff described Carmichael as \\"one of America's most prolific songwriters\\" and an \\"iconic pianist\\" whose work appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, including his performances in classic films such as To Have and To Have Not and The Best Years of Our Lives. Among the hundreds of Carmichael's published songs, \\"Stardust\\" is one of the most frequently recorded. Carmichael's greatest strength was as a melodist, but he also became known as an \\"experimental\\" and \\"innovative\\" songwriter, whose \\"catchy, often jazz-infused, melodies\\" and \\"nostalgic, down-home lyrics\\" were memorable and had wide public appeal, especially with mass media promotion and through the efforts of numerous entertainers who performed his songs.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A little boy rides a bike down a hill on a miniature dirt bike.\\" if \\"A little boy is hitting a jump on a hill on a miniature dirt bike.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given statement, \\"A little boy is hitting a jump on a hill on a miniature dirt bike,\\" it can be inferred that the little boy is engaged in an activity involving a miniature dirt bike on a hill. However, it is not entirely certain if we can directly conclude that \\"A little boy rides a bike down a hill on a miniature dirt bike.\\" For a more comprehensive understanding, let's analyze both statements thoroughly. In the first statement, \\"A little boy is hitting a jump on a hill on a miniature dirt bike,\\" it is evident that the boy is participating in an adrenaline-pumping activity by hitting a jump on a hill. This suggests that he has enough control and skill to execute a jump using the miniature dirt bike. Although it can be assumed that the boy must have ridden the bike to reach the top of the hill, the statement does not clearly mention it. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"A little boy rides a bike down a hill on a miniature dirt bike,\\" describes a scenario where the boy is actually riding the dirt bike down a hill. This sentence refers to a simpler, less thrilling activity compared to hitting a jump on a hill. While both statements involve a little boy, a hill, and a miniature dirt bike, the context and the primary actions are different. In the first statement, the focus is on the excitement of hitting a jump, whereas, in the second statement, the focus is on the action of riding downhill. In conclusion, although both statements share similarities, it is not entirely accurate or justified to conclude that \\"A little boy rides a bike down a hill on a miniature dirt bike\\" simply from the fact that \\"A little boy is hitting a jump on a hill on a miniature dirt bike.\\" The two statements present different contexts and actions. It is likely that the boy needed to ride the bike up and/or down the hill while hitting the jump, but since the provided information only explicitly mentions the boy hitting a jump, drawing the conclusion that he rides the bike down the hill would involve making assumptions that may or may not be accurate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods.

So, it means \\"area of success.\\" 4. \\"oli\\" is the verb \\"to be\\" in past tense, meaning \\"was.\\" This shows that the speaker is talking about something that has already happened. 5. \\"epäilemättä\\" means \\"undoubtedly\\" - this shows that the speaker is very sure about what they are saying. 6. \\"EMU\\" stays the same because it is an abbreviation, just like in English (it stands for Economic and Monetary Union).

Question: suppose it is a windy part of the world happens, how will it affect water breaks down crystals. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's examine the steps and effects involved: 1. Magma cools inside the crust 2. Magma crystallizes 3. Lava cools on the surface 4. Lava crystallizes 5. Minerals dissolved in water crystallize In a windy part of the world, the most likely aspect to be affected is the cooling of magma and lava, as wind can influence the rate of cooling. However, the proposed perturbation concerns the breakdown of crystals by water. The windy conditions would not have a direct impact on the water's ability to break down crystals. The effect of wind on water is primarily related to increased evaporation and surface movement. The dissolution and breakdown of crystals depend on factors such as water temperature, acidity, and the composition of minerals. The second effect mentioned is the crystallization of magma. Windy conditions will not directly influence this step, as magma crystallization occurs inside the Earth's crust, not on the surface where the wind has an impact. Therefore, windy conditions are likely to have no effect on the second mentioned effect (magma crystallization). In summary: - Perturbation: Windy part of the world - Effect on water breaking down crystals: No effect - Influence on the second effect (magma crystallization): No effect"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","completion":"(a). yes; Based on the information given in the premise, the hypothesis \\"The list includes alcohol and injury\\" is true. The premise clearly states \\"alcohol and injury\\" are on the list, indicating that these two items are included. To elaborate, a hypothesis is an assumption made based on some evidence. It is a tentative explanation for an observation, which can then be tested by empirical research. In this case, the hypothesis is that \\"The list includes alcohol and injury.\\" Exploring the premise in detail, it mentions \\"Alcohol and injury, as well as brief interventions, are on the list.\\" Now, breaking down this sentence, we firstly identify that there is a 'list'. The premise further goes on to detail what this list contains. Our primary concern here are the terms \\"alcohol and injury\\". Since the premise verbatim states that \\"alcohol and injury\\" are on this list, it is a logical conclusion that the hypothesis \\"The list includes alcohol and injury\\" is correct. The relationship between alcohol and injury is a widely studied topic in different fields such as public health, psychology, sociology etc. It accounts for issues concerning how alcohol use can contribute to the risk of injuries. The premise also makes a mention of \\"brief interventions\\" in conjunction with alcohol and injury. Brief interventions are preventive strategies typically used in healthcare settings to identify and provide initial assistance to patients at risk of alcohol-related problems, and can also apply to areas of accident and injury prevention.

Do not go swimming in a pool or lake while the piercing is healing. Bodies of water contain a lot of bacteria. Your piercing will be extra susceptible to bacteria while it's healing.

Step 1: Break the text into the main points and questions posed In the given text, there are several elements: - Mention of Seth and Dominic - Seth touched the \\"Maleficium\\" - Seth split into two entities: Himself and Dominic - Questions: 1. Why were Seth and Dominic linked together in the first place? 2. If Dominic is a fallen angel, what is Seth? Step 2: Contemplate the possible reasons for the linkage between Seth and Dominic Since touching the \\"Maleficium\\" led to the split, it is possible that the object itself has a magical or powerful effect, causing the person who touches it to separate themselves into two different entities. This separation might be related to the user's emotions, character, or a hidden agenda. Moreover, the initial linkage between Seth and Dominic could also be a side effect of the Maleficium's magic. Step 3: Determine the nature of Seth, given that Dominic is a fallen angel There seems to be an idea of duality between Seth and Dominic after the split. If Dominic is a fallen angel, it implies that he probably represents a darker or negative side. Following this logic, Seth might represent the opposite essence, which could be a more positive or good nature, as opposed to Dominic the fallen angel. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of Seth. Step 4: Provide answers to the questions 1. Seth and Dominic were likely linked together in the first place because of the magical or powerful properties of the Maleficium. The object seems to have the ability to split a person into two different entities, possibly based on the individual's character, emotions, or a hidden agenda. 2. If Dominic is a fallen angel which represents a darker or negative side, Seth could represent the opposite essence of Dominic, such as a more positive or good nature.

But as the race for the Republican nomination has been consumed by scandals and slip-ups, Trump has upped his rhetoric on Twitter voicing disdain for Obama and his policies.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. After reading the above, is \\"The river small and sluggish\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What attracted bigger vessels to the island?\\"?","completion":"No, \\"The river small and sluggish\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"What attracted bigger vessels to the island?\\". The correct answer would be the strategic location, deep-water channel close to the coast, sheltered harbor, and the protection from monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. These factors made it an attractive stop for the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What culture's literature grew due to the group that only had a limited measure of independence?, using the article: Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The culture's literature that grew due to the group that only had a limited measure of independence is the Eastern Chalukya literature, which flourished under the Eastern Chalukya kingdom. The Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock, and their kingdom included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam in present-day Andhra Pradesh. The Eastern Chalukya kingdom developed from the Vengi Viceroyalty, which gained independence after the death of Pulakeshin II. However, for much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas, a powerful dynasty in the western Deccan. It was during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that the Eastern Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. As the Eastern Chalukyas gained some autonomy and faced consistent territorial disputes with other ruling dynasties such as the Rashtrakutas and the Western Chalukyas, their literature began to grow and evolve. Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas encouraged the Kannada language and literature. However, as their interactions with other dynasties increased, their literary culture started incorporating other languages and influences as well. Their literature began thriving in a multilingual environment, featuring works in Kannada, Sanskrit, and Telugu. This growth in Eastern Chalukya literature can be attributed to the limited measure of independence that the kingdom experienced during the reigns of rulers such as Bhima I, Vijayaditya II, and Saktivarman I. Their literature was enriched through cultural exchanges and interactions with neighboring kingdoms and states, influencing their language, themes, and literary styles. In conclusion, the Eastern Chalukya literature grew significantly due to the group's limited measure of independence that allowed the kingdom to interact with other dynasties, fostering a rich, diverse, and multilingual literary culture in the eastern Deccan region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

( Of course , I doubt she knows Charlotte 's my favorite not because I empathize with her , but simply because Kristin Davis is hot . ) Answer the following question: Why was his friend surprised ?","completion":"His girlfriend's surprise was a result of couple of factors. First, it appears that the man and his girlfriend were discussing a TV show, movie, or perhaps a book which features a character named Charlotte. This was presumably a series that she would not have expected him to be interested in; otherwise, her surprise that he not only knew the characters' names, but had also picked out a favorite character, would not make much sense. Such a reaction suggests an underlying presumption about what kind of media he might typically engage with. The surprise may be based on a stereotype about the types of media men usually consume, or it could be grounded in personal knowledge about his habits and tastes which do not usually extend to the ‘type’ to which such series belongs. The girlfriend likely assumed that this was something that he would not pay much attention to, perhaps because they hadn't discussed it in depth before, or because he hadn't shown a discernible interest in similar series or genres in the past. The fact that he not only watched or read it, but also was engaged enough to learn the characters' names and have a favorite character, shocked her. She would also have been surprised that he had an opinion about the characters to the extent of having a favorite one. It indicates a certain level of engagement with the medium beyond what she would have imagined. Knowing a character’s name requires remembering it, which usually happens when an individual is engaged in the content. Going beyond just knowing the names, and developing a likeness for one of them reveals a deeper level of emotional involvement to the storyline. Interestingly, in parentheses, he revealed that his favorite character, Charlotte, was so named not because he empathizes with her or relates to her, but simply because he finds the actress, Kristin Davis, attractive. Yet, he chose not to disclose this reason to his girlfriend, suggesting a playful secrecy and further deepening the factors behind her surprise. So, in a way, the reasons behind his favorite choice and him knowing the characters' names were not as connected to the content as she might have thought. The girlfriend's surprise therefore hinges on her previous comprehension of his interests and preferences in media, which this revelation appears to have upended. It is an unexpected deviation from their traditional patterns of consumption, of which she believed she had a comprehensive understanding. This unusual disclosure ruptured those established norms, leading to her surprised reaction."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Input: Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (EDH) play important roles in modulating vascular tone in a distinct vessel size-dependent manner; NO plays a dominant role in conduit arteries and EDH in resistance vessels. We have recently demonstrated that endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is functionally suppressed in resistance vessels through caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-dependent mechanism, switching its function from NO to EDH/hydrogen peroxide generation in mice. Here, we examined the possible importance of the physiological balance between NO and EDH in cardiovascular homeostasis.', 'We used 2 genotypes of mice in which eNOS activity is genetically upregulated; Cav-1-knockout (Cav-1-KO) and endothelium-specific eNOS transgenic (eNOS-Tg) mice. Isometric tension recordings and Langendorff experiments with isolated perfused hearts showed that NO-mediated relaxations were significantly enhanced, whereas EDH-mediated relaxations were markedly reduced in microcirculations. Importantly, impaired EDH-mediated relaxations of small mesenteric arteries from Cav-1-KO mice were completely rescued by crossing the mice with those with endothelium-specific overexpression of Cav-1. Furthermore, both genotypes showed altered cardiovascular phenotypes, including cardiac hypertrophy in Cav-1-KO mice and hypotension in eNOS-Tg mice. Finally, we examined cardiac responses to chronic pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction in vivo. When compared with wild-type mice, both Cav-1-KO and eNOS-Tg mice exhibited reduced survival after transverse aortic constriction associated with accelerated left ventricular systolic dysfunction, reduced coronary flow reserve, and enhanced myocardial hypoxia.

Question: Who can achieve popehood? Context: There is disagreement about the origin of the term, but general consensus that \\"cardinalis\\" from the word cardo (meaning 'pivot' or 'hinge') was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \\"superior.\\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \\"title\\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.

This sentence implies that the process of writing about computers required significant research, making it more challenging than writing about sports. This might be due to various factors, such as the complexity of the subject matter, the technical aspects, and the rapid advancements taking place in the field of computers. In contrast, writing about sports might have been relatively easier because the subject matter is often more familiar and accessible to many people. Sports are a universal theme that is easier for individuals to relate to and understand. Additionally, sports topics tend to focus on events, personalities, and competitions, which involve less technical knowledge than computers. When researching computers, the writer probably had to explore various aspects, such as the evolution of computer technology, the different types of hardware and software, and the role of computers in modern society. Moreover, they might have needed to delve into specific details about computer components, programming languages, and operating systems. This thorough investigation required a considerable amount of time and effort as well as a good understanding of the subject matter. However, researching sports might have focused more on the histories and rules of specific sports, the accomplishments of athletes, and the economic and cultural impact of various sporting events. Although this research can be extensive, it would likely involve less technical jargon and a better overall understanding of the topic for a layperson. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"... because we had to research the computers\\" to emphasize that writing paragraphs about computers was more difficult due to the depth of research involved. It highlights the complexities and technicalities associated with computer technology, making it a more challenging topic to write about compared to sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Parsing the first sentence. \\"During the French and Indian War, the French abandoned their outposts and burned their fort in 1759.\\" This sentence mentions the event (the French and Indian War), then talks about what the French did (abandoned their outposts and burned their fort), and finally when it all happened (in 1759).

Sadly in my job (Ob/gyn nurse) there is one thing I have to report fairly often, that a pregnancy is not going to happen. Sometimes the mom’s are bleeding and they kind of know that this is going to happen, but sometimes, they are not bleeding and it is a gut punch without any warning. This can be an ultrasound that shows no heartbeat or a lab test that is declining. Nothing is worse than the look on a woman’s face when she is looking forward to her first glimpse of her baby only to be told that the baby is not alive. It doesn’t get any easier, no matter how many times you do it. My own daughter called me one day to announce she was pregnant and two days later, we found out she was miscarrying and I bawled all day. I never even knew this baby, but now, 15 years later, just writing this now is making my eyes water. I have to do a lot of this over the phone and that makes it even harder because I am not able to offer comfort and I don’t know where they are or what they are doing when they get this news. If they call me for their lab results, they might be driving, they might be walking around the mall, they will have to call their significant other and break the news, such difficult conversations to have over the phone. I have been very, very lucky that the few times I have seen advanced pregnancies that underwent a fetal demise were handled by the physicians that I have worked with. I can’t imagine being almost ready to deliver and having all your hopes and dreams crushed. Obstetricians sometimes have the very best job, bringing new lives into the world and seeing the new families bonding, but sometimes they also have the very worst job.

In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at 125 million. Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at 35 million in 1996 and 20 million in 1997. In the year after his death, more than 8.2 million of Jackson's albums sold in the US, and 35 million albums worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009. In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He became the first artist to sell one million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads. Thriller, Number Ones and The Essential Michael Jackson became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album. Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top 20 best-selling albums in a single year in the US.Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were 4.2 billion. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated 300 million in royalties.

As a poetry lover, this app has become an indispensable tool in helping me create, innovate, and dive deeper into my passion for words and verse. One of the app's most noteworthy aspects is its comprehensive dictionary and thesaurus. The search function is swift and intuitive, providing me with both common and obscure words along with their definitions, synonyms, and antonyms. This feature has proved immensely helpful in guiding me through my writer's block and broadening my vocabulary in the process. Additionally, the inclusion of a handy rhyme search is nothing short of genius. It has made it incredibly easy for me to find words that will bring harmony and melody to my writing. The app also offers a random word generator, which I frequently use to inspire my creative endeavors and challenge myself to incorporate new words into my poetry. The user interface is streamlined and aesthetically pleasing, with an ideal balance of simplicity and function. Navigation is smooth and hassle-free, making it an absolute breeze to transition between tools and features.

Here are the step-by-step solutions: Step 1: Look at the original equation: -2662*a = -2595*a + 335 You need to get all the terms with 'a' on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. So, start by subtracting -2595*a from both sides to get the 'a's iconsistent: -2662*a + 2595*a = -2595*a + 335 - 2595*a This simplified to: -67*a = 335 Step 2: To isolate 'a', you have to get rid of the -67 that's multiplied with it. You do this by doing the inverse operation. Since -67 is multiplied with 'a', you'll need to do division here. Divide both sides of the equation by -67: (-67*a) / -67 = 335 / -67 Step 3: Calculate each side of the equation: a = 335 / -67 a = -5 Hence, the solution to the equation -2662*a = -2595*a + 335 is a = -5.

Runner Laura Wellington was nearing the finish line of the 26 mile race when the explosion went off killing three people and injuring 183. She has told how she was given the medal from around another runner's neck as he comforted her by the roadside. After several frantic attempts, she finally made contact and discovered all were safe. As she sank to the floor, weeping and weak with relief, the fellow runner stopped to comfort her.

She said: 'At that moment, a couple walking by stopped. The woman took the space tent off her husband, who had finished the marathon, and wrapped it around me. 'She asked me if I was okay, if I knew where my family was. I reassured her I knew where they were and I would be OK. 'The man then asked me if I finished to which I nodded \\"no.\\" He then proceeded to take the medal off from around his neck and placed it around mine. 'He told me \\"you are a finisher in my eyes.\\" I was barely able to choke out a \\"thank you\\" between my tears.'

People are taken from the streets or their homes and imprisoned for general 'political crimes' as well as involvement in the arts. Article:","completion":"Title: The Dark Reality of North Korean Detention Camps: A Quest for Freedom and Human Rights Intro: The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or more commonly known as North Korea, has long been shrouded in an enigmatic veil, hiding an extensive web of brutal prison camps that is believed to be holding more than 200,000 of its citizens. These individuals are incarcerated for a spectrum of offenses – from petty disputes to grave political crimes. The inhumane conditions within the walls of these detention facilities have long been a cause of concern for the global human rights community. In a bid to address this issue, the South Korean government is sending religious leaders on a mission to strike a dialogue with the North Korean regime, in hopes for a better understanding and an open conversation surrounding this pressing circumstance. Detention Camps: The Harsh Reality Spread across the mountains and valleys of North Korea, these detention camps are often completely hidden from satellite reconnaissance and the general public. The North Korean regime runs a highly secretive policy and is known for its strict surveillance and ruthless punishment of any source of dissent or divergence from their ideals. The individuals held captive would have been taken from the streets, or even from their homes, under little or no provocation, and locked away for committing a wide range of offenses. The Crimes and Punishments The North Korean regime classifies crimes as general political crimes and arts related crimes. Political crimes range from outward dissent against the government to indirect displays of unhappiness with the current state of affairs. Pyongyang's regime does not spare its people, as even basic human rights are subdued, making the population vulnerable to the state's whims. Arts-related crimes involve producing or possessing anti-regime material such as books, movies, and music. The thought policing in North Korea is extreme, and it poisons the minds of its citizens into submission. Beyond these offenses, individuals who flee the country or attempt to defect are met with severe consequences and are most likely to end up in one of these labor camps. Families of the accused also face a similar fate, as guilt by association is integral to North Korea's justice system. The government's approach to maintaining its grip on its people is through fear and threats, leaving little room for hope and dreaming of a better life. The Mission for Change: South Korea's Diplomatic Efforts In a desperate attempt to bring light into this dark reality, the South Korean government has taken a significant step by sending religious leaders on a rare mission to North Korea. Led by the highest-ranking clergy, the delegation seeks to smooth relations between the countries and hold a top-level dialogue with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-Il. The purpose of these talks is to directly address the atrocious human rights abuses and explore potential avenues for bringing about change to the lives of more than 200,000 innocent men, women, and children held captives in North Korean detention camps. Conclusion: The suffering and societal decay trailing the existence of these detention camps in North Korea demand urgent international intervention. With escalating reports of systematic torture, forced labor, and dire living conditions, the global community, including religious and civic leaders, must act in unison to address this human rights crisis. In a world constantly striving for progress and safety, it is paramount that efforts be made to secure a brighter future for North Korean citizens. The move by the South Korean government, although small in scale, could potentially be the starting point of an unprecedented change, bringing hope for many who have long been silenced and tormented by their oppressive state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Duncan Lee Hunter (born May 31, 1948) is an American politician. He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California's 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses. On December 8, 2006, Hunter introduced H.R. 6375, which would have required the defense department to post the purpose of all congressional earmarks in annual defense bills, along with the location and a grade according to the utility of the earmark. Hunter introduced H.R. 552, The Right to Life Act, on February 2, 2005. The purpose of the bill is to \\"implement equal protection... for the right to life of each born and preborn human person.\\" In the 109th Congress, the legislation collected 101 cosponsors. Hunter states that The Right to Life Act \\"would legally define \\"personhood\\" as the moment of conception and, therefore, guarantee all constitutional rights and protections, including life, to the unborn without utilizing a constitutional amendment.\\" Hearings for H.R. 552 were scheduled for December 12, 2006, but were cancelled right before the House adjourned. On April 28, 2004, Hunter introduced legislation that he said could \\"turn parents into prosecuting attorneys fighting a wave of obscenity.\\" HR 6390 IH, also called the \\"Parents Empowerment Act\\", would allow the parent or guardian of a minor to sue in federal court anyone who knowingly disseminates material \\"that is harmful to minors\\", or specifically, \\"any pornographic communication, picture, image, graphic image file, article, recording, writing, or other pornographic matter of any kind\\", if it is distributed in a way that \\"a reasonable person can expect a substantial number of minors to be exposed to the material and the minor, as a result to exposure to the material, is likely to suffer personal or emotional injury or injury to mental or moral welfare.\\" In 1994, Hunter legislatively mandated the construction of 14 miles (23 km) of security fencing on the international land border separating San Diego County and Tijuana, Mexico. In 2005, Hunter introduced legislation calling for the construction of a reinforced fence along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, citing crime statistics as measures of San Diego-Tijuana fence's success. After successfully adding an amendment to a House-passed bill that ultimately stalled in House-Senate negotiations, Hunter's amendment was later incorporated into H.R. 6061, the Secure Fence Act, introduced by New York Congressman Peter T. King. He has said that if he becomes President, the 754-mile (1,213 km) double layer border fence will be built in less than 12 months. Hunter repeatedly voted against international trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). What other trade agreements did he veto?","completion":"Duncan Hunter's opposition to various international trade agreements stemmed from his focus on protecting American jobs and industries. It's important to note that as a member of the House of Representatives, he did not have the power to \\"veto\\" agreements, but he could vote against them. In addition to his opposition to NAFTA, CAFTA, and the WTO, Hunter was also opposed to other trade agreements and policies that he deemed unfavorable to American businesses and workers. For instance, in 2000, he voted against Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China, which would grant China permanent, unconditional normal trade relations status and paved the way for China to join the WTO. He saw the move as a potential threat to American jobs, specifically in the manufacturing sector, due to China's low labor costs. Furthermore, Hunter was opposed to the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), also known as \\"fast track\\" authority, which allows the president to negotiate trade agreements that Congress can only approve or disapprove but not amend or filibuster. He feared that by granting the president such extensive powers, free trade agreements that undermine American jobs and industries could be passed with minimal congressional oversight. While it's challenging to identify every single trade agreement and policy Hunter voted against during his tenure in the House of Representatives, it's evident that his primary concern revolved around the potential negative impact these agreements could have on American businesses, jobs, and domestic industries. In line with this, Hunter frequently voiced his concerns about the potential deleterious effects of globalist trade policies on the U.S. economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima Blush giving a sadomasochistic beating to a patient in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Blush finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which scans his eye. Bond is seen by Blush and an attempt is subsequently made to kill him in the clinic gym, but Bond manages to defeat the assassin. Blush and her charge, a United States Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi, are operatives of SPECTRE, a criminal organisation run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the retinal pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent iris recognition security at an American military base in England. While doing so, he replaces the dummy warheads of two cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads; SPECTRE then steals the warheads, intending to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments. Blush murders Petachi to cover SPECTRE's tracks. Under orders from the Prime Minister, M reluctantly reactivates the double-0 section and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her wealthy lover, Maximillian Largo, a SPECTRE agent. Bond follows Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas, where he spars with Blush and Largo.

He addressed a rally in Indiana alongside Mr. Trump on Tuesday night and met privately with him several times. But Mr. Trump himself has sent conflicting signals in recent days, as he has subjected his potential running mates to a final round of screening. As of Thursday afternoon, he had not yet formally invited Mr. Pence to join his ticket, nor had he notified two other contenders, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, of his decision, according to people with direct knowledge of the process. Mr. Trump has appeared to vacillate over his choice. Long accustomed to making important strategic decisions by sheer improvisation, he is now faced with the most permanent, and perhaps most important, decision of the campaign. The delay has the potential to complicate a partnership with Mr. Pence, who must file papers in Indiana by noon on Friday withdrawing from his re-election campaign in order for Republicans to field a new candidate for the race. Photo On Wednesday, Mr. Trump and his children threw together a hasty series of conversations with other finalists in the vice-presidential search, including Mr. Christie, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Mr. Gingrich. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Paul Manafort, the chairman of the Trump campaign, said at midday Thursday that the campaign had not notified anyone of a final decision. ”We have not been reaching out to Washington to tell them to prepare for any particular candidate,” Mr. Manafort said by phone. A low-key man largely defined in public life by his Christian faith, Mr. Pence, 57, is seen as a cautious choice — a political partner who is unlikely to embarrass Mr. Trump, and who may help him shore up support among conservative voters still wary of his candidacy. Mr. Pence’s staunch conservative views on certain social issues, like gay rights and abortion, may inject a new set of concerns into the general election debate that have been largely overlooked with Mr. Trump at the top of the Republican ticket. Mr. Gingrich, in a video broadcast on Facebook, said Mr. Pence would bring “Midwestern appeal” to the Trump ticket, and would pair Mr. Trump with a “relatively stable, more normal person.” Mr. Gingrich added that he had told Mr. Trump that a Trump-Gingrich combination would be a bolder pairing of “two pirates” on the same ticket. Selecting Mr. Pence, by contrast, might ease relations between Mr. Trump and Republicans in Washington, where party leaders have eyed his every move with grave apprehension. Republicans on Capitol Hill spoke approvingly of Mr. Pence on Thursday: He is seen among his former colleagues there as a conventional politician with standard-issue conservative beliefs, including on some subjects where his policy instincts plainly conflict with Mr. Trump’s. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Pence has endorsed free-trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Asian trade deal that Mr. Trump has described as a “rape” of the American economy. As a House member, Mr. Pence also voted for the Iraq War, which Trump has condemned, and last winter he denounced Mr. Trump’s call to ban all Muslim immigration into the United States. If those views place Mr. Pence at odds with Mr. Trump, they are in line with the outlook of Republican leaders in Congress. “It’s no secret I’m a big fan of Mike Pence’s,” said Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House from Wisconsin. “We’re very good friends. I have very high regard for him. I hope that he picks a good movement conservative. Clearly, Mike is one of those.” The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said picking Mr. Pence would be a “good move by Donald Trump.” Mr. McConnell, who has sharply rebuked Mr. Trump in recent weeks for his indiscipline on the campaign trail, said he would “look forward to enthusiastically supporting the ticket.” First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday. To Democrats, Mr. Pence cuts an unimposing profile, and party officials said Thursday they considered him unlikely to transform Mr. Trump’s deeply unpopular public image. On the contrary, his archconservative social views could help motivate liberal voters and young people to turn out for Hillary Clinton in the fall. At the same time, Democrats have looked with some dismay at Mr. Trump’s tenacity in the Midwest, and at his unusual popularity with white men. Mr. Pence could reinforce Mr. Trump’s strengths in both areas. The Senate minority leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, indicated that the focus of the fall campaign would be Mr. Trump himself. “It’s not going to help him that much, no matter who he picks,” Mr. Reid said. For Mr. Trump, selecting Mr. Pence would be a sharp departure from habit, and the surest sign yet that he intends to submit to at least some standard political pressures in the general election. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Pence’s public audition for the No. 2 spot, when he appeared with Mr. Trump on Tuesday at a rally in Westfield, Ind., went well. Standing ramrod straight, Mr. Pence offered five and a half minutes of high-energy remarks, frequently turning his fire to Hillary Clinton in an apparent attempt to demonstrate that he could be an attack dog against her. But in the past, Mr. Trump has leaned heavily on a tiny circle of trusted friends and advisers, and has crafted his major political decisions to shock and titillate the news media and Republican primary voters. Mr. Pence is a laid-back personality who does not have the same set of showman’s instincts as Mr. Trump or other vice-presidential contenders like Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Christie. And the Indiana governor has only the scantiest of personal relationships with the man whose political future has rapidly melded with his own. ||||| Buy Photo Longaberger leaves its basket building next week. The future use of the building is unknown. (Photo: Jessica Phelps/The Advocate)Buy Photo Story Highlights On Dec. 8, 1997, 225 Longaberger employees (of 500 eventually) moved into the basket building. Next week, the remaining 10 employees will move out of the company's deteriorating home office. NEWARK – Nineteen years ago, 225 employees of The Longaberger Co. couldn't wait to enter their new workplace, a 32 million, seven-story replica of the company's Medium Market Basket that eventually housed 500 workers. Today, the 10 remaining employees inside the deteriorating structure can't wait to leave the world's largest basket building and join their co-workers at the company's manufacturing campus and home office at the Longaberger Homestead, two miles east of Frazeysburg. The 180,000-square foot building will be vacant in a week, as the last employees move out Thursday or Friday, taking their supplies to the Muskingum County facility. There were 68 employees working at the basket building last year, according to city documents. Brenton Baker, director of marketing and communications for Longaberger, said the move will not be a sad day for the employees, who have been looking forward to being with the rest of the Longaberger employees and working closer to home. \\"It is not a sad thing we are leaving,\\" Baker said. \\"People keep saying they feel sad for the employees. Don't feel sad for us. I cannot wait for next week. For me, next week can't come fast enough. For the people on the outside, it's probably not that way. \\"We, the employees, asked if we could move out of the building. We're pretty busy. No one is standing around lamenting much.\\" Newark city officials have discussed what will become of the basket after Longaberger leaves, but no solutions have yet emerged on what to do with the building that was a worldwide news story in 1997. Longaberger, one of several direct-selling companies owned by JRJR Networks, owes 577,660 in property taxes due by July 20, and, with interest and penalties, will owe 605,219, due by Aug. 1. The company has made no payments since Nov. 24, 2014, when it paid 10,000. It paid 70,000 that year, but nothing since. Leaving the East Main Street property will not change Longaberger's tax obligations, which will continue to mount, according to Licking County Treasurer Olivia Parkinson. \\"Taxes are still due whether it's vacant or not,\\" Parkinson said. \\"The only way it would change is if they file by March 31 with the Board of Revision to change the taxable value.\\" Parkinson said the Licking County land bank, of which she is a member has discussed the basket and the city has been in contact with public-private partnerships, searching for an answer. \\"We're trying to work with whomever we can to find a solution,\\" Parkinson said. \\"Foreclosure could happen at any time. It's been eligible for awhile, but we'd rather find a solution.\\" When the move is complete, about 50 employees will be working in the two-story office building on the front of Building A at the manufacturing campus. Baker estimated 60 percent of the employees making the move live in Muskingum County. He said about 30 percent live in Licking or Coshocton counties, and 10 percent in Franklin County. The 20-mile separation of Newark employees and those at the manufacturing campus has become a hassle, Baker said. \\"Everybody was so spread out and now we'll all be in one big office building together,\\" Baker said. \\"When we had big meetings, we either had to drive up there or they had to drive down here. And, I drive from Nashport, so it will cut my drive time in half. \\"I'm a people person. I'd rather walk over and talk to you then send an email. That was hard to do in the basket. It's a massive space.\\" The move has occurred gradually over the last month, as the new facility received new carpet, paint and wiring for phone lines. \\"We didn't have to be out of the building on a certain date, so we're doing it gradual,\\" Baker said. \\"There hasn't been any disruption in business. We moved people over in small shifts, so it wasn't a giant strain on any department.\\" The goal, Baker said, was to have the home office moved before the annual Longaberger Bee, which is July 21-23 at Tri-Valley High School, in Dresden, and at the Homestead. The 2015 Bee returned to Dresden for the first time in 30 years. The 9,000-ton building was built with a 30,000-square foot atrium with natural light from the skylight to the lobby floor, two 75-ton heated handles, a large cafeteria area, a 100- to 120-seat theater with a stage, several conference areas for board meetings or training, 84 windows and 31 restrooms. \\"The building served us well and was a great testament to the vision of our founder,\\" Baker said. \\"We have the flexibility to move into a space that will serve us better. I don't think of it as an end of an era, but the start of a new chapter.\\" kmallett@newark advocate.com 740-328-8545 Twitter: @kmallett1958 Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/29CF7Jy |||||","completion":"Donald Trump has not yet formally invited Governor Mike Pence of Indiana to be his running mate, nor has he informed the other two shortlisted contenders, Newt Gingrich and Chris Christie.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Born to a single mother, Betty Brown, in York on 23 December 1948, Davis was initially brought up by his grandparents there. His maternal grandfather, Walter Harrison, was the son of a wealthy trawlerman but was disinherited after joining the Communist Party; he led a 'hunger march' to London shortly after the more famous Jarrow March, which did not allow Communists to participate. His father, whom he met once after his mother's death, is Welsh. After his mother married Ronald Davis, the family moved to London, where they lived initially in a flat in Wandsworth which Davis has described as \\"a terrible little slum\\". Context: Whilst a student, Davis was active in the Federation of Conservative Students, becoming national chairman in 1973. Davis was first elected to Parliament in the 1987 general election as the MP for Boothferry which, in 1997, became the constituency of Haltemprice and Howden. He was a government whip when parliament voted on the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, angering many of the Maastricht Rebels on his own right-wing of the party. Davis's progression through the Conservative ranks eventually led to him becoming a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1994-97). He rejected a shadow ministerial position under William Hague, opting instead to chair the Public Accounts Committee. In 1999, Davis presented the Parliamentary Control of the Executive Bill to the House of Commons, in which he proposed to transfer ministerial exercise of the Royal Prerogative to the Commons in the following areas: the signing of treaties, the diplomatic recognition of foreign governments; European Union legislation; the appointment of ministers, peers and ambassadors; the establishment of Royal Commissions; the proclamation of Orders in Council unless subject to resolutions of the Commons; the exercise of the powers of the executive not made by statute; the declarations of states of emergency; the dissolution of Parliament. Davis used his first interview as Shadow Home Secretary in November 2003 to state his personal support for a reintroduction of the death penalty for people convicted of multiple murder \\"where there is clear evidence and no doubt\\" surrounding the offender's guilt, citing \\"Yorkshire Ripper\\" Peter Sutcliffe and Moors Murderer Ian Brady as examples of offenders who would fall into this category. This interview came almost 40 years after the abolition of the death penalty for murder. As Shadow Home Secretary, Davis turned the Conservatives away from the Labour Party's plan to reintroduce identity cards, citing spiralling costs and libertarian issues. He turned initial Conservative support into one of concern and abstention, making the final change to one of opposition much easier. Davis believed that once the true cost and unreliability of the ID card scheme was explained to the general public, they would turn against it. He was also credited, by some commentators, with \\"claiming the scalps\\" of two Labour ministers, David Blunkett and Beverley Hughes after both were forced to resign. Question: What did David Davis do politically after his student time in politics?. Whats the answer?","completion":"After David Davis finished his time as a student in politics, he became more involved in the Conservative Party. He was elected to Parliament in 1987 as the MP for Boothferry, which later became Haltemprice and Howden. He held different positions, like being a government whip and a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He also chaired the Public Accounts Committee and tried to make changes in how certain powers were handled with a bill he proposed. As Shadow Home Secretary, he changed the Conservatives' opinion on identity cards and helped make the party oppose the idea. He also made some people believe he was responsible for two Labour ministers resigning. So, he did a lot of important things in politics after being a student."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Therefore, I would not validate the given answer as complete and accurate. To provide a more appropriate answer for the question, the ingredients of Alka-Seltzer should be listed. Alka-Seltzer is an over-the-counter antacid and pain relief medication that comes in the form of effervescent tablets. The primary ingredients of Alka-Seltzer include: 1. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid): This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that acts as a pain reliever and reduces inflammation. It is a key component of Alka-Seltzer, providing relief from headaches, minor body aches, and fever. 2. Sodium bicarbonate: Also known as baking soda, this ingredient acts as an antacid that helps to neutralize stomach acid, providing relief from heartburn, acid indigestion, and an upset stomach. 3. Citric acid: This ingredient reacts with sodium bicarbonate to create the fizzing or effervescent effect when the tablet is dissolved in water. Additionally, the effervescence facilitates the easy digestion and absorption of the medication's active ingredients. 4. Other inactive ingredients: These may include flavors, lubricants, and binders to help with the tablet's taste, stability, and appearance. Some common inactive ingredients in Alka-Seltzer formulations include acesulfame potassium, aspartame, mannitol, and povidone.

Answer:","completion":"From the information provided in the given review \\"Lakshay,\\" it is difficult to make a clear and informed recommendation about the app. A detailed and comprehensive analysis of an application usually requires understanding various aspects, such as its functionality, design, user interface, pricing, and overall user experience. Unfortunately, the review provided does not offer enough context or insight to make an informed decision on whether to recommend the app or not. Despite the lack of sufficient information, I will attempt to break down the possible scenarios based on the provided response options, so you can have a better perspective on whether to recommend the app or not: 1. Not at all: This would indicate that the app has significant issues that make it unsuitable for use, such as poor functionality, design, relentless bugs, or an overall poor user experience. If the reviewer meant \\"Lakshay\\" as a negative remark, it may fall under this category. 2. No: This option, although less severe than 'Not at all,' still signifies dissatisfaction with the app. It implies that the app might have some redeeming qualities but is not good enough to be recommended to others. This might be the case if the app requires improvement in specific areas but is not entirely useless. 3. Maybe: This scenario implies that the app neither excels nor fails in meeting users' expectations. It could mean that the app is average in terms of functionality, design, and user experience. The reviewer might be ambivalent or might think that the app's usefulness depends on individual preferences and situations, warranting a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation. 4. Yes: If the reviewer intended \\"Lakshay\\" as a positive remark, the app might be deemed satisfactory in its design, functionality, and user experience. In this situation, it would mean that the app's purpose is being fulfilled, and the reviewer might recommend it to a friend. 5. Definitely: This option is saved for apps that are exceptional in terms of fulfilling their purpose, presenting a great user interface, and providing a seamless user experience. If \\"Lakshay\\" is interpreted as strong praise, recommending the app to a friend would be the appropriate choice in this situation. With the limited context available, it is impossible to commit to a particular stance. It is crucial to seek more comprehensive feedback or further information about the app to make an educated decision on whether to recommend it. I suggest reaching out to the reviewer to clarify their stance or checking additional reviews to have a broader perspective on users' opinions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: From undergraduate education through residency, a doctor’s education now lasts 14 years. After all that education, the average doctor graduates with 160,000 student debt. Zeke Emanuel and Victor Fuchs question whether all that training - and all that spending - is actually necessary: Why is medical school 4 years in length? The answer probably has to do with the Flexner Report’s recommendation in 1910 for 2 years of preclinical science training followed by 2 years of clinical training. Yet most physicians could be trained in significantly less time. Since 1997, the University of Pennsylvania has only 1 years of preclinical science training. The important patient care skills can be obtained in less than 2 years of clinical training. The medical school at Harvard University requires students to complete only 15 months of clinical rotations....This change would be consistent with the increasing emphasis on individualized instruction and assessing students on core competencies rather than on time served. Consistent with this proposal, Texas Tech School of Medicine as well as 2 Canadian medical schools now offer 3-year programs. Emanuel and Fuchs suggest reducing doctors’ training time by 30 percent, from 14 to 10 years. That would create space to train more doctors, they argue, while also reducing physicians’ debt burdens. It could also have the effect of driving down American doctors’ salaries, which are double that of doctors in most other countries, but often justified because of the profession’s expensive training costs here ||||| Viewpoint JAMA. doi: 10.1001/jama.2012.292 Shortening Medical Training by 30% Ezekiel J.

Since this article does not have an abstract, we have provided the first 150 words of the full text. Experts agree that there is substantial waste in the US health care system.1 This waste drives up costs, threatens the government's long-term fiscal stability, suppresses incomes, and reduces resources for public education and other essential services. Similarly, there is substantial waste in the education and training of US physicians. Years of training have been added without evidence that they enhance clinical skills or the quality of care. This waste adds to the financial burden of young physicians and increases health care costs. The average length of medical training could be reduced by about 30% without compromising physician competence or quality of care. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The average doctor's education, spanning 14 years, results in significant student debt and high salaries, which contributes to the overall cost of healthcare in the United States. Emanuel and Fuchs propose that the medical educational process can be shortened by 30%, from 14 years to 10 years, without compromising clinical skills or the quality of care. They provide examples of medical schools, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Texas Tech, and two Canadian institutions, which offer condensed preclinical and clinical training programs. This reduction in training time would not only lower the financial burden on young doctors but also allow for training more doctors. Additionally, it may lead to a decrease in doctors' salaries in the United States, bringing them more in line with those in other countries, ultimately helping to drive down overall healthcare costs."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Some key areas Pope John XXIII focused on were the rights to life, bodily integrity, necessary means for the proper development of life (such as food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and rest), and access to social services. He also promoted the idea of solidarity among nations, asserting that no country should act solely in its own interest but rather, work together for the common good of humanity. Furthermore, he called for disarmament and peaceful resolution of conflicts, while addressing the inequities in the distribution of wealth and resources, advocating for social and economic development that benefits all members of society. Overall, Pope John XXIII's Pacem in Terris demonstrated his profound commitment to human rights and social justice and had a lasting impact on the Catholic Church and international community. It inspired further development of Catholic social teaching and spurred on various human rights initiatives, both within the Church and the wider global context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Departures (Japanese: okuribito, Hepburn: Okuribito, \\"one who sends off\\") is a 2008 Japanese drama film directed by Yojiro Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki, Ryoko Hirosue, and Tsutomu Yamazaki. Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nokanshi--a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Japanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally--though not always--conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites. In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called nokan), as depicted in Departures, is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas. This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional morticians (Na Guan Shi , nokanshi) ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up. The body is then put on dry ice in a casket, along with personal possessions and items necessary for the trip to the afterlife. Despite the importance of death rituals, in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals. People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued. Until 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or nokanshi. As of 2014, about 80% of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral. A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest among the young. Belief in the existence of a soul (54%) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead (64.9%) was likewise common. Motoki, by then in his early 40s and having built a reputation as a realist, was cast as Daigo. Veteran actor Tsutomu Yamazaki was selected for the role of Sasaki; Takita had worked with Yamazaki on We Are Not Alone (1993). Although the character of Mika was initially planned as being the same age as Daigo, the role went to pop singer Ryoko Hirosue, who had previously acted in Takita's Himitsu (Secret) in 1999. Takita explained that a younger actress would better represent the lead couple's growth out of naivety. In a 2009 interview, Takita stated that he had cast \\"everyone who was on my wish list\\". Motoki studied the art of encoffinment first-hand from a mortician, and assisted in an encoffining ceremony; he later stated that the experience imbued him with \\"a sense of mission ... to try to use as much human warmth as I could to restore [the deceased] to a lifelike presence for presentation to her family\\". Motoki then drilled himself by practising on his talent manager until he felt he had mastered the procedure, one whose intricate, delicate movements he compared to those of the Japanese tea ceremony. Takita attended funeral ceremonies to understand the feelings of bereaved families, while Yamazaki never participated in the encoffinment training. Motoki also learned how to play a cello for the earlier parts of the film. To provide realistic bodies while preventing the corpses from moving, after a lengthy casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing to the need to see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect. The non-profit organization Sakata Location Box was established in December 2007 to handle on-location matters such as finding extras and negotiating locations. After deciding to shoot in Sakata, Location Box staff had two months to prepare for the eighty members of the film crew. Negotiations were slow, as many local property owners lost interest after learning that the filming would involve funeral scenes; those who agreed insisted that shooting take place outside of business hours. Toyama was both the setting of Coffinman and Takita's home prefecture, but filming was done in Yamagata; this was largely because the national Nokan Association, headquartered in Hokkaido, had a branch office in Sakata. Some preliminary scenes of snowy landscapes were shot in 2007, and primary filming began in April 2008, lasting 40 days. Locations included Kaminoyama, Sakata, Tsuruoka, Yuza, and Amarume. The NK Agent office was filmed in a three-storey, Western-style building in Sakata built between the mid-Meiji and Taisho periods (1880s-1920s). Originally a restaurant named Kappo Obata, it went out of business in 1998. The Kobayashis' cafe, called Concerto in the film, was located in Kaminoyama in a former beauty salon. From a hundred candidates, Takita chose it for its atmosphere as an aged building with a clear view of the nearby river and surrounding mountain range. The scene of the shooting of the training DVD took place in the Sakata Minato-za, Yamagata's first movie theatre, which had been closed since 2002. The soundtrack to Departures was by Joe Hisaishi, a composer who had gained international recognition for his work with Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. Before shooting began, Takita asked him to prepare a soundtrack which would represent the separation between Daigo and his father, as well as the mortician's love for his wife. Owing to the importance of cellos and cello music in the narrative, Hisaishi emphasized the instrument in his soundtrack; he described the challenge of centring a score around the cello as one of the most difficult things he had ever done. This score was played during shooting, which according to Takita \\"allowed [the crew] to visualize many of the emotions in the film\\" and thus contributed to the quality of the finished work. Upon completion, Takita declared Departures \\"perfect\\", and praised the crew for their self-reliance in developing the content and the humble, \\"hand-made\\" quality of the film. That the film's initial success depended largely on word-of-mouth was also a source of pride for the director. Coffinman author Shinmon Aoki praised Motoki's performance and the film's ability to show the importance of family and interpersonal connections, despite his disappointment at the dropping of the story's religious aspect. When and where was Departures filmed?","completion":"The filming of \\"Departures\\" began in April 2008 and it took place in several locations. These include Kaminoyama, Sakata, Tsuruoka, Yuza, and Amarume, which are all in Yamagata, Japan. This is evident from the passage: \\"Some preliminary scenes of snowy landscapes were shot in 2007, and primary filming began in April 2008, lasting 40 days. Locations included Kaminoyama, Sakata, Tsuruoka, Yuza, and Amarume.\\" The building used for the NK Agent office was a three-story, Western-style building in Sakata that was built between the mid-Meiji and Taisho periods (1880s-1920s)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After spending the day at the resort together, the girls are invited to the men's yacht where they plan to party out at sea. While aboard the boat, they take drugs and the conversation turns to sex, and in particular, types of sexual acts. Bluey describes a sex act called a \\"donkey punch\\" which involves punching the female in the back of the head while having doggy style sex in order to increase the sexual pleasure for the man. Marcus, Bluey, Kim and Lisa go to the master bedrooms where they begin having drug-fuelled sex, watched by Josh who, in the knowledge of all involved, lingers furtively in the darkness, recording the action with a camera. Bluey, who is copulating with Lisa, asks Josh to film the action and then decides to let Josh take a turn. Josh and Lisa then have anal sex. Immediately prior to ejaculation and with Bluey's encouragement, Josh donkey punches Lisa but uses excessive force, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. To cover up the incident, the men decide to throw the body overboard while the women want to report it to the authorities, and argument ensues about what to do with the tape. Bluey continually insults Tammi and in a fit of rage, she stabs him in the chest with a penknife, and the women escape in the yacht's tender. However, the girls soon realise that the tender's outboard motor is missing (a cut scene shows it still attached to the yacht). In a fit of despair, Tammi fires a flare, attracting the attention of the men. They quickly locate and pick up the women.

Scott Kevin Walker (born November 2, 1967) is an American politician serving as the 45th and current Governor of Wisconsin since 2011. First elected Wisconsin Governor in the 2010 general election, he won a 2012 recall election and was reelected a second time in 2014. He is a former member of the Wisconsin State Assembly and a former Milwaukee County Executive. Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Walker was raised in Iowa and in Delavan, Wisconsin, before attending Marquette University. On April 2, 2012, Walker signed a law to fund evaluation of the reading skills of kindergartners as part of an initiative to ensure that students are reading at or above grade level by 3rd grade. The law also created a system for evaluating teachers and principals based in part on the performance of their students. It specified that student performance metrics must be based on objective measures, including their performance on standardized tests. Walker approved a two-year freeze of tuition at the University of Wisconsin System in the 2013 budget. In 2014, he proposed a two-year extension of the freeze based on expected cash balances for the system in excess of 1 billion. On February 3, 2015, Walker delivered a budget proposal to the Wisconsin Legislature, in which he recommended placing the University of Wisconsin system under the direction of a \\"private authority\\", governed by the Board of Regents (all the governor's appointees). The budget proposal called for a 13% reduction in state funding for the university system. The budget proposal also called for re-writing the Wisconsin Idea, replacing the university's fundamental commitment to the \\"search for truth\\" with the goal of workforce readiness. Walker faced broad criticism for the changes and at first blamed the rewriting of the Wisconsin Idea on a \\"drafting error.\\" Politifact and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel later reported that Walker's administration had insisted to University of Wisconsin officials on scrapping the Wisconsin Idea, the guiding principle for the state's universities for more than a century.

Process: - Blood is sent to the liver - The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The blood is cleaned - Energy is produced - The blood leaves the liver cleaned. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the turbine will spin slower happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The process you have described is an oversimplified version of the liver's function, which involves a wide range of metabolic and detoxification processes. Your \\"perturbation hypothesis\\" refers to a hypothetical situation where a turbine spins slower, and you are asking if this would have an effect (direct or indirect) on the liver working harder. To address this question, it is first important to clarify that there is no direct mention of a turbine in the human body or liver function. However, the question seems to be related to understanding the overall energy production and liver function in the human body. In this context, the \\"turbine\\" could be taken metaphorically to represent cellular energy production mechanisms, such as the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through cellular respiration in the mitochondria. If we assume that the \\"turbine\\" represents cellular energy production, then the hypothetical situation where the \\"turbine spins slower\\" could be interpreted as a decrease in overall cellular energy production. In this case, a decrease in energy production would potentially lead to reduced efficiency or capacity for the liver to perform its necessary functions, including detoxification and metabolic processes. As a consequence, the liver may have to work harder to accomplish its tasks, which could potentially lead to liver stress or damage over time if the energy deficit were significant and sustained. It is also important to note that because the liver is closely connected with the function of other organs and systems in the body (such as digestive, endocrine, and immune systems), changes in its performance could have wider indirect effects on general health as well. In summary, if the supposed \\"turbine\\" refers to cellular energy production mechanisms within the liver, a reduction in energy production may lead to the liver having to work harder to maintain its functions, potentially causing stress or damage to the liver, as well as potential indirect effects on other systems within the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - sporting event - lecture - school - concert hall - hockey game The rationale to choose \\"school\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The most appropriate choice among the given options is \\"school\\" as the answer, based on several factors and the context provided in the question. Firstly, the question specifically mentions the principal speaking. Principals are typically associated with educational institutions, such as schools. In this context, it is logical to deduce that the event taking place is related to a school function, gathering, or meeting. Principals are responsible for overseeing the academics, discipline, and community relationships within a school and often address the students, teachers, parents, and various stakeholders through different events like school ceremonies, parent-teacher meetings, or school assemblies. Secondly, let's evaluate the other choices and why they are less fitting for the scenario described: - Sporting event: While it is true that schools may host various sporting events, the primary focus of such events is athletic competition rather than addressing an audience by a principal. It would be unusual for the principal to have a speaking engagement as the focal point of a sporting event. - Lecture: A lecture typically refers to a formal academic presentation given by an expert, teacher, or professor. While a principal might occasionally participate in a lecture, the context of the question highlights that the audience is watching the principal as the main speaker. It is more likely that this setting is a school event rather than an academic lecture. - Concert hall: Although a concert hall could be a possible venue for a school event, the principal's speech might not be the main focus in such a setting. Concert halls are mainly designed for musical performances and other performing arts, thus not being the most suitable answer for the given situation. - Hockey game: A hockey game is a sporting event, primarily focused on the athletic competition between two teams. It is highly unlikely that the principal's speaking would be a significant element or the focal point to consider in such an event. Considering the given options and the context of the question, it is safe to conclude that the audience is seated in a school setting while they watch the principal speaking. This choice is the most suitable and reasonable explanation of the scenario, given the position and role of the principal within an educational institution."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Jurors 3, 4, and 10 for the following movie plot: In a New York City courthouse, an eighteen-year-old boy from a slum is on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \\"not guilty\\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the \\"rarity\\" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances. He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote \\"guilty\\" when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt.Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others, Juror 8 reluctantly agrees that he has only succeeded in hanging the jury. Instead, he requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He...

Guy reminds her he \\"dragged her out of the gutter to make her a star\\". He's furious that she left him, outraged over her \\"silly Reno divorce\\" and indignant that she is playing around with young men, in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast. They argue vehemently until a furious Christine slaps her husband's face four times.

He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who think that he is the escaping murderer.Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses. Also, he is known to own a raincoat matching the murder weapon, a belt coiled in the form of a large question mark that lay near the corpse. Robert claims innocence, but in the crowd that has gathered, none believe him.

Brigitte and Ginger are lost with their horse in the rugged Canadian wilderness when they come across a seemingly abandoned camp that bears signs of a violent attack.

The woman speaks of them as the red and black, and warns that unless they \\"kill the boy\\" one sister will kill the other. Suddenly the girls' horse is startled and flees; they try to chase it, but Brigitte's foot gets caught in a trap set by an Indian hunter. Ginger goes back to the camp to find the Indian woman, but the hunter arrives before Ginger returns. The girls view him as a threat until he releases Brigitte and leads them to Fort Bailey where they take refuge. Ginger claims they are the daughters of a trader who drowned, seeking passage East. The men there are suspicious of them, but the sisters are permitted to stay.The fort has been under siege by werewolves for some time.

Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lake will have less algae? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","completion":"Lake Costanza will likely have less algae. Based on the information provided, lake Montopeke is situated near a farm that receives regular rainfall. When it rains, the water dissolves the fertilizer in the soil and creates runoff which carries the dissolved fertilizer away from the farm and can eventually end up in nearby bodies of water like lake Montopeke. This dissolved fertilizer contains nitrogen, which is a key nutrient that encourages algae growth. Therefore, the continuous introduction of dissolved nitrogen-rich fertilizer into lake Montopeke due to the runoff will lead to an increased growth of algae. On the other hand, the farm adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain. Since there is little to no rain to dissolve the fertilizer in the soil, there will be considerably less runoff carrying the dissolved nitrogen-rich fertilizer from the soil into lake Costanza. As aresult, there is a lower chance of excessive algae growth in this lake due to the reduced amount of nitrogen being introduced through runoff. Therefore, lake Costanza is expected to have less algae compared to lake Montopeke. However, it is important to note that other factors like temperature, sunlight, and the availability of other nutrients can also contribute to the growth of algae in both lakes. Nonetheless, rainfall and resulting runoff seem to be the primary factors differentiating the two lakes in the given scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What determined the end? Context: In 1926, Universal opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of Joe Pasternak. This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler's increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles. Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary.

The move comes after a court ruling in May gave people in the EU the ‘right to be forgotten’ on the internet. The Microsoft-owned search giant has created an online request form that lets people identify specific web pages they want omitted. European web users can now ask search engine Bing (pictured) to remove links they don't like, following the 'right to be forgotten' court ruling in Luxembourg in May. This ruling requires search engines to remove information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' - or face penalties. Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under. Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to. ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to. them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.' This. particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child,. when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was. collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the. storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’ The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who. has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps,. including technical measures' to remove it. If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. ‘We will use the information that you provide to evaluate your request,’ said the Bing request form. ‘This information will help us to consider the balance between your individual privacy interest and the public interest in protecting free expression and the free availability of information, consistent with European law. ‘As a result, making a request does not guarantee that a particular search result will be blocked.’ The site added it will also consider other sources of information beyond the form to verify or supplement the information, and create a case for removal. It also said submissions may be re-evaluated over time, and this could lead to previously deleted results reappearing. People submitting requests are required to prove who they are, and whether they are a public figure such as a politician or celebrity. They are also asked to explain why they feel the data should be removed. Examples given include if the information is ‘out-of-date, false, incomplete or inappropriate’. The Microsoft-owned search giant has created an online request form (pictured) and said not all requests will be removed, and submissions will be re-evaluated over time.

The court ruled that individuals have the right to have links to information about them deleted from searches in certain circumstances, but only if they meet specific criteria. If search services don't comply, they face heavy fines. Google began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on May 30. When searches are made on Google, a warning message now appears at the bottom of the page that tells users results 'may have been removed.' This warning appears on all results regardless of the name searched. The decision affects 500 million citizens and states that if search services don't comply, they face heavy fines. Google (pictured) began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on May 30. Earlier today, Microsoft announced plans to cut up to 18,000 jobs this year as the company to reposition itself for the future. Following the Nokia acquisition, completed in April, Microsoft had roughly 127,104 employees. This means meaning the cuts could reduce nearly 15 per cent of its workforce. Microsoft said the vast majority of the cuts will come in the next six months, and will fully implemented over the next year. 'There's many open questions,' Google. Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said at the company's annual shareholder. meeting in response to a question about the ruling and its implications. on Google's operations. 'A simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know. 'From Google's perspective that's a balance,' Schmidt added. 'Google believes having looked at the decision, which is binding, that the balance that was struck was wrong.' European citizens can submit take-down requests directly to Internet companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling. If a search engine elects not to remove the link, a person can seek redress from the courts. The ruling seems to give search engines. more leeway to dismiss take-down requests for links to webpages about. public figures, in which the information is deemed to be of public. interest. The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice (pictured). It comes after a Spanish man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Students in Gainesville, Georgia, are likely eating a better lunch than you today. On the menu in their cafeterias? Chicken salad on a bed of spinach with strawberries and Mandarin oranges. Boneless wings. Brunch for lunch. Roughly 76% of students in Gainesville City Schools qualify for free or reduced-cost meals under the National School Lunch Program. Since the program's nutritional guidelines went into place in 2012, school administrators have been getting creative with their food program to create meals children like. \\"Taste testing is where it's at,\\" said Penny Fowler, the district's director of school nutrition. \\"They're your customers. It's like running a business.\\" Fowler said her team has worked hard to implement the new guidelines, which are entering a third school year this fall. The ultimate goal is to reduce childhood obesity, which according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in 30 years. Gone are the days of mystery meats and grilled cheese on white bread. Instead, participating schools in the federal lunch program are required to serve skim or low-fat milk, add more whole grains, include a fruit and vegetable at each meal and prepare food with zero grams of trans fat per serving. Calorie and sodium limitations are also in place. \\"With one-third of American children obese or overweight, members in both parties agreed that Americans' tax dollars should fund healthy and wholesome food,\\" said Kevin Concannon, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services. USDA new rules for school meals. About 90% of schools are now in compliance with the new guidelines, according to the USDA, with students eating about 16% more vegetables and 23% more fruit on a daily basis. But there's been controversy over the program's implications for school food budgets. The USDA says 1 million fewer students nationwide are eating federal school lunches since the guidelines were enacted in 2012 -- either by personal choice, or because their schools have opted out of the lunch program altogether. What it really comes down to, experts say, is money. Wealthier school districts can turn down federal reimbursements if their students aren't enjoying the healthier fare. Districts with more students who qualify for the program, such as in Gainesville, often don't have a choice. Economics of school lunch. Established in 1946, the National School Lunch Program was created to provide free or low-cost meals to students. Although the program is optional in most states, the federal reimbursement for students' meals is so significant that some schools find it too expensive to run programs on their own, said Diane Pratt-Heavner, â€Ždirector of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, a national organization of school nutrition professionals. The School Nutrition Association was instrumental in helping the Obama administration put these new nutrition guidelines in place; now the organization is lobbying for schools to be allowed to opt out. Opponents say food companies are working behind the scenes, trying to keep their less-healthy items on the menu longer. The USDA gives schools in the continental U.S. 0.28 per lunch for students who pay full price. For students in need, the USDA pays almost 10 times more: 2.58 for those who qualify for reduced price meals and 2.98 for children who qualify for a free lunch. It isn't surprising then that state agencies reported to the USDA that students leaving the program were mainly from residential child care institutions, wealthier districts and/or smaller schools with low percentages of children eligible for free and reduced-price meals. Fort Thomas Independent Schools in Kentucky is one such district that decided to opt out for the 2014-2015 academic year. The local high school was losing students to its rivals: Subway and a handful of convenience stores down the street. With an open campus, students can leave for lunch, and administrators say the daily exodus increased after new nutritional guidelines went into effect two years ago. This meant less money being spent in the cafeteria. \\"The guidelines are too strict and the kids can leave,\\" said Gina Sawma, the school district's food and nutrition director. \\"If they aren't eating with us, they're leaving and eating junk.\\" Sawma says the biggest challenges were the calorie and sodium restrictions required by the federal program. The students wanted more protein and larger portions, especially athletes. The school has a robust football program that has won 22 Kentucky state championships. Douglas County High School in Colorado and Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake Board of Education in upstate New York also have called it quits, citing burdensome regulations, hungry children and a decline in food sales that led to large amounts of debt. Like Fort Thomas, these school districts are in areas with relatively high median incomes and have a low percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced meals. Donna Brazile: Let them eat ... whatever. Schools that predominantly serve low-income students have fared better in both revenue gains and participation, according to the USDA. Since they are unable to opt out of the program, and students can't afford to eat elsewhere, cafeteria workers are making the new rules work. The Los Angeles Unified School District, which has one the highest concentrations of low-income students in California, is an example. Since the nutrition guidelines were established, there has been a 14% increase of participation in its school lunch program. Testing taste buds. For some schools, labor and food costs, and the quality of kitchen equipment can play a role in whether their revamped food program is a success, says Pratt-Heavner. Schools in small and rural areas may also have local vendors and distributors that don't carry a great deal of healthy food options. Sawma in Kentucky, for example, found that foods that met the new dietary guidelines from her vendors didn't taste all that great. She says companies are trying, but may just need more time to reformulate their foods so they taste better. \\"It's important to keep in mind that all school meal programs are different,\\" Pratt-Heavner explained. \\"Some communities have an easier time if students are more familiar with healthy foods at home.\\" Most students seem to be liking the healthier lunches despite some early negative feedback. A survey published in the Childhood Obesity journal reported that 70% of elementary school children, 70% of middle schoolers and 63% of high school students liked their school's meals. And schools opting out of the federal lunch program aren't necessarily serving unhealthy fare. In the Fort Thomas district, Sawma said schools will continue to serve extra fruits and vegetables at no charge and add back larger portions of protein and the popular homemade soups, which had to be discontinued due to the National School Lunch Program's calorie restrictions. She said she has received calls from vendors selling unhealthy foods after the school district announced it was leaving the federal program, but she made it clear her schools have always offered healthy foods. Soft drinks and candy bars aren't on the menu. For those schools remaining in the National School Lunch Program, the USDA is offering technical support, help with recipes and financial assistance. According to the USDA, about 48 million in grants is still available to schools with lunch programs. \\"The USDA continues to help schools by demonstrating flexibility and common sense as we work together to improve the health of the nation's next generation,\\" Concannon said. \\"The department will continue to provide additional funding and training to schools as progress continues.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"Students in Gainesville, Georgia, are getting creative with their school lunch menu to create healthier meals that children actually like.

They despair when they watch their beloved spend much money on extra baggage charge. Nearly half of these women admitted to lying about the weight of their case to their partner before leaving for the airport, in fear of being made to unload some unnecessary items. But it's a fact that women pack more than they need. On average, a woman needs around 57 items in suitcase for a two-week holiday, yet most women pack nearer to 150 items, ranging from skirts, tops, underwear and high heels. In addition, women pack more sun cream, make-up and hair appliances than they were likely to need. They all take up space in the suitcase, only a third of them will see the light of day once at the holiday place. 79 percent of women admitted to taking extra items with them, with the reason for this being \\"just in case\\". Women plan their holiday wardrobe months in advance. Packing enough clothes and other items to last a month is not enough for some women. They'd take a chance to shop for new items while holidaying abroad. So they'll return with even more luggage in their cases. Professor Karen Pine said: \\"Women are tempted to take familiar items with them on holiday, often everything except the kitchen sink. Some people find traveling stressful, particularly when they're unsure about the home comforts available at their holiday place. They over-pack to help cope with those feelings of stress and reduce the uncertainty.\\" This will come as no surprise to some men, who are used to trying to squeeze their partner's luggage into the boot of the car with their own, smaller case.

Write a title for this article: It's no miracle, but it sure is a rare event: A reticulated python (the world's largest species of snake) gave birth to six babies without the help of a male partner. The birth actually occurred in 2012. But it was only a few months ago that researchers published DNA evidence that Thelma — an 11-year-old, 200 pound, 20-foot-long female at the Louisville Zoo — was the sole genetic parent. Until then, zoo keepers figured it was much more likely that Thelma's body had held onto sperm from an unknown male for a long time before using it to fertilize her eggs. \\"We didn't know what we were seeing. We had attributed it to stored sperm,\\" the zoo's snake curator, Bill McMahan, told National Geographic. \\"I guess sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.\\" This is the first case of such a birth recorded in Thelma's species, but it's not the first seen in the animal kingdom — or even in the snake world. In a phenomenon called parthenogenesis, females who would typically use two-parent sexual reproduction are sometimes able to accomplish the deed on their own. Researchers say that Thelma's six female offspring were \\"half-clones,\\" National Geographic reports. That means that her egg cell probably interacted with something called a polar body — a cell made up of genetic material that's left over when the egg cell forms. These polar bodies usually just die, but sometimes they can meet up with egg cells and (if they form the right number of chromosomes once they're put together) an embryo can begin to form. Thelma's reproductive system may have triggered the rare phenomenon because of her unusually luxurious surroundings: She lived in a large habitat, surrounded by heating pads, and was fed massive quantities of food. With conditions so optimal for reproduction, what should have been a cellular fluke ended with six healthy babies. Of course, those healthy babies are still pretty inbred — and while they're doing just fine in their zoo enclosure, their keepers don't think they'd have survived in the wild.

Washington (CNN) -- The looming decision on Syria is likely to preoccupy Congress for the next couple of weeks and complicate President Barack Obama's domestic agenda. Obama's push for military intervention against Bashar al-Assad's regime over alleged chemical weapons use could push aside his top priorities on immigration and health care. Because he decided to seek congressional approval and now faces strident opposition from many lawmakers and the public to his idea, Obama is having to go all-in in his sales job. His vigorous public relations campaign is all-consuming -- precious time that could have been used guiding an immigration bill through the House and informing the public about a new program to obtain health insurance under Obamacare. In other words, in addition to OPTIONS: - Barack Obama, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. - Bashar al-Assad, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. - CNN, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. - Congress, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. - House, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. - Obama, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. - Obamacare, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. - Syria, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. - Washington, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list.","completion":"In other words, for Congress, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. The immediate focus on Syria and the divisive struggle to gain support for military intervention will undoubtedly force other significant domestic policy issues, such as immigration reform and health care, to take a back seat. The resulting prioritization has the potential to create a domino effect in which a lack of attention and resources on Obama's part could lead to roadblocks and delays in achieving his broader policy goals. The decision to seek congressional approval for military action against Syria has opened up a can of worms, with both Democrats and Republicans expressing concerns and hesitations. The ongoing debate and negotiations over this matter are putting Obama in a difficult spot: the more time and energy he devotes to persuading lawmakers and the public of the necessity of intervention, the less time and energy he has to address other cornerstones of his presidency, such as immigration reform and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Putting immigration on the back burner, in particular, could have long-lasting consequences not only for the millions of undocumented immigrants who anxiously await news of their fate but also for the American economy. Immigration reform has been a contentious and challenging issue for years, with politicians struggling to find a solution that satisfies a range of concerns from national security to the rights of individuals who have made a life in the United States. Obama's inability to dedicate time and resources to this debate leaves the door open for stagnation and inaction. In a similar vein, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act - or Obamacare - requires an extensive public education campaign to inform eligible individuals on how to enroll for health insurance under the new system. This endeavor would benefit from Obama's direct involvement, both to marshal resources and to lend credibility to the information being distributed. However, with his attention diverted towards seeking approval for military action in Syria, the rollout of this essential health care initiative could suffer too. In conclusion, the highly-charged debate surrounding the decision on Syria is casting a long shadow over other key issues on the president's agenda. The urgent need for congressional support on military intervention has forced Obama to shift his focus away from vital domestic policy arenas such as immigration reform and health care. This reprioritization could have significant repercussions on policy initiatives and the lives of millions of Americans who stand to benefit from a more balanced allocation of federal resources and legislative attention."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Thursday night on All In with Chris Hayes: Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote an op-ed published Wednesday in The New York Times to “speak directly to the American people and their political leaders” about the crisis in Syria. Putin made his case against potential United States involvement in Syria, arguing that the U.S. must follow international law and not take action without the approval of the United Nations Security Council. According to President Putin, Russia’s opposition to U.S. strikes is not about protecting the Syrian regime, but rather protecting the sanctity of international law. The Russian president also warned of an increase in violence, terrorism, and general instability in the region if President Obama carries out a military strike. Julia Ioffe, Senior Editor at The New Republic, will join the table to discuss Putin’s message. Plus: Texas Senator Ted Cruz made waves Wednesday with his comments about former Senator Jesse Helms, known for his far-right political leanings. Senator Helms held racist and homophobic views, and filibustered the bill proposing that Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday become a national holiday. Cruz praised Helms, saying, “we need a hundred more like Jesse Helms in the U.S. Senate.” Former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele will join Chris to talk about Cruz’s controversial remarks. Later, Chris will discuss Pope Francis’ actions pointing the Catholic Church in the direction of tolerance and compassion. The pope, elected earlier this year, has projected a public image as a man of the people, driving a used car around Vatican City, taking “selfies,” posting pictures to Instagram, and calling up people who write him letters. This week, Pope Francis expressed his views on atheists, implying in a letter to an Italian newspaper that those who do not belong to the church can still go to heaven if they are good people. The Vatican’s new secretary of state also opened the door to discussion within the Church about allowing priests to marry in an interview with a Venezuelan paper. Chris Hayes will also speak with Alexis Goldstein, former Wall Street professional and member of the Occupy Network, and Neil Barofsky, Former Special Inspector General in charge of oversight of TARP, as the fifth anniversary of the financial collapse approaches this weekend. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke at George Washington University Thursday about lessons learned from the 2008 disaster. Also this week, the city of Richmond, California, advanced a plan to seize its residents’ underwater mortgages and help homeowners who got caught up in the housing crisis. Meanwhile, many of the Wall Street executives responsible for the financial crisis are still living large, according to a Center for Public Integrity investigation.

Review: I bought a pair of 501's from Amazon and they feel a little lighter than my last two pairs I bought right off the shelf at SEARS almost a year ago. That's about it. I'm happy with my purchase. But! I usually buy 505's, but with the great variables in sizing I wont buy that style without trying them on first.

The reviewer expresses satisfaction with their purchase of the Levi 501's from Amazon, stating that they feel lighter and still fit the same way each time, regardless of the country they are made in. This demonstrates a positive sentiment towards the specific product. However, the mixed sentiment comes into play when the reviewer discusses the need for consistency in sizing and their dissatisfaction in finding that their favorite jeans are now being manufactured in various countries, thereby altering the idea of 'homemade.' Their disappointment and concern about the changing landscape of product manufacturing can be considered as a negative sentiment towards the broader issue. Overall, while the review does mention some negative aspects, the satisfaction with the purchased product and the positive sentiment towards the 501's indicate that the review leans more towards a positive sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Claire Jones, 23, has panic attacks and is physically sick at the thought of eating proper meals. The barmaid has a bizarre disorder which meant she eats practically nothing but potatoes, cheddar cheese and coleslaw - and only a particular brand. Fussy eater: Claire Jones lives on a diet of jacket potatoes because she has a phobia of almost all foods. Picky: The bizarre disorder means she has eaten more than 13,000 jacket potatoes - topped with particular brands of cheddar cheese and coleslaw. Claire will only eat Maris Piper potatoes, mild cheddar cheese and Tesco Finest coleslaw. Very occasionally she will try some bread, sausage or a burger, but even this slight change in her diet makes her feel sick - as does the smell of cooking. Selective eating such as Claire's is a recognised condition and can have negative health implications - in her case, persistent infections and anaemia. She said: 'I'm fed up of eating jacket potatoes but I don't know how to stop. I keep getting ill. My immune system is really bad. 'I've had a sinus infection for the past six months. I'm constantly tired.' She added: 'Trying new foods has made me physically sick, so I just don't do it now. 'It's so bad, it's taken over my life. I'm scared to go to the supermarket or eat out with friends. 'I went to a work party and when they brought out the buffet, I started shaking. I couldn't get out quick enough.

'I've always been fussy but it was only recently I realised it was an actual disorder.' Claire blames her diet on being a picky eater, which started when she was just a baby. She began refusing food aged two. She said: I think it was built in me from birth. 'Mum said I would go for days without eating. Habit: Claire has been a picky eater since she was a baby.

'I've. gone out before and they've not had what I can eat on the menu so I've. sat there and not eaten anything. I'll just go hungry. 'Luckily, my boyfriend Luke is really understanding.' Friends and family have tried to persuade her to vary her diet. She said: 'Mum gets really worried about me. She says I need to see someone. She says it's not right.' She. said: 'I also hate watching people eat. The worst thing I have to do at. work is a table check, because you have to interrupt people while. they're eating. Unhealthy: Claire suffers from persistent infections and anaemia as a result of her limited diet. Help: Claire, who couldn't even manage a bit of her 21st birthday cake (pictured) has now joined a Selective Eating Disorder support group. 'They didn't say anything about waitressing at the job interview. I just thought it was bar work. I don't think I would've taken the job if I'd known.' Her mother Debbie, who also has a son, Glenn, 27, said: 'I always cooked meals from scratch. Glenn was very good and loved his food but Claire was always very difficult with eating. 'When she was younger and we went camping, I'd have to bring food from home. I'd try to buy food from the supermarket where we were staying but she refused to believe it was the same. 'I always make sure I have jacket potatoes in the cupboard or she'd probably not eat much at all.'I do worry because she's not getting the right vitamins.' Claire has joined a Selective Eating Disorder support group and wants to finds a medical specialist or psychologist to help her beat the condition.

The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Answer:","completion":"In the 2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony, the iconic British comedy character Mr. Bean, portrayed by actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson, appeared in a hilarious and memorable segment wherein he jokingly played an instrument to the famous record \\"Chariots of Fire.\\" This iconic piece of music, composed by Greek musician Vangelis, is well-known for being the main theme of the 1981 British film of the same name, which tells the true story of two British athletes competing in the 1924 Olympic Games. The Mr. Bean scene during the Opening Ceremony was a comic homage to the film and its famous soundtrack. The sequence began with the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle, performing \\"Chariots of Fire.\\" As the music played, the camera panned to reveal Mr. Bean in the orchestra, playing a single note on a synthesizer. As the performance continued, Mr. Bean showed off his trademark clumsy and aloof behavior, struggling to stay awake while waiting for his turn to play his single note again. Eventually, he started daydreaming and found himself in a hilariously exaggerated recreation of the iconic beach running scene from the \\"Chariots of Fire\\" movie. In his dream, Mr. Bean comically cheated his way through the race, hilarity ensued as he humorously used various tactics to gain an advantage over his fellow racers. At the last moment, Mr. Bean crossed the finish line ahead of the others by commandeering a vintage car. The dream sequence then ended, and Rowan Atkinson's character returned to the reality of the orchestral performance. The humorous intervention of Mr. Bean and his unconventional rendition of \\"Chariots of Fire\\" during the 2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony provided a light-hearted and uniquely British moment within the event. It highlighted the UK's capacity for comedy, creativity, and self-parody while also paying tribute to a classic film about the triumph of the human spirit within the realm of sports – a perfect theme to inaugurate the Olympic Games in London."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Former venture capitalist acknowledges not investigating sex harassment claim A former venture capitalist at high-profile Silicon Valley investment firm testified Monday that he did not investigate allegations of sexual harassment by a female employee because he was worried about her privacy. Ray Lane, a once prominent managing partner at Kleiner Perkins, took the witness stand today in a gender bias trial in San Francisco and said he was shocked when Trae Vassallo, his direct report, complained about sexual harassment by co-worker Ajit Nazare. But he indicated he did not look into the claims. “Didn’t you know that the employer has a responsibility to launch an investigation?” an attorney asked Lane. “Then I made a mistake,” Lane responded, explaining that an investigation would mean telling colleagues everything. “I cared more about her feelings than anything else. She’s married. She has children. It should be her choice.” It was the fifth day gender-discrimination case filed by Ellen Pao, a former Kleiner Perkins venture capitalist, against her former employer. Pao claims she was pressured into a sexual relationship by senior partner Nazre and then was retaliated against after she complained. Kleiner Perkins, meanwhile, has argued that Pao simply didn’t have the skills to be promoted. Its defense has highlighted performance reviews in which she received mixed marks for being “territorial” and pushed the idea that venture capital is a field where relatively few climb the ranks. Pao’s attorney is trying to show that the firm had a pattern of turning a blind eye to sexual harassment. Bringing up Vassallo, a fellow junior colleague, is intended to bolster Pao’s own case that the office was a difficult environment for women. Vassallo alleges that Nazre made sexual advances twice. The first time came at a dinner in 2009 when he touched her under the table with his legs. After the first dinner, Vassallo said she reported the incident to Lane after she learned Nazre would be leading her performance review. “Ultimately people said they’d keep an eye on the review to make sure it was fair,” she said. Later, in a second incident, Nazre invited Vassallo to a meeting he’d set up with a CEO in New York City. When Vassallo and Nazre arrived at the restaurant, the CEO never showed. After dinner, Nazre knocked on her hotel room door wearing a bathroom robe and slippers. Vassallo also reported this incident to Lane, but he joked about it rather taking it seriously, she said. “I went to Ray and said it happened again,” she testified last week. “He said you should be flattered. He asked me what he should do. I said, ‘I don’t know.’ ” However, Vassallo said she believed Lane would do something. When nothing happened, she sat down and wrote a letter to the managing partners who then launched an internal investigation. However, Lane said he had asked Vassallo if she wanted a formal investigation, which would have involved talking to all the management partners. He said she didn’t want an inquiry, contradicting her testimony that she merely “didn’t know.” Lane, a former chairman at Hewlett-Packard and president at software giant Oracle, testified that he encouraged Vassallo to think about whether or not she wanted an investigation. “This is a very serious allegation and I feared for her safety,” he said. He said he would have discussed the topic with her if she did not come back, but she returned with a letter documenting her complaint for management. Nazre was fired shortly after. During the internal probe, Vassallo told the investigator Lane was from a different generation. “I knew he was trying to be funny when he said I should be flattered by Nazre’s attention,” she said in court. Earlier on the stand, Lane mentioned that he did not know whether Vassallo had been promoted in 2011. He then said he had opposed her promotion.

Given the fact \\"if something is outside during the day then that something will receive sunlight\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"If a plant is moved from a basement to a field\\"","completion":"If a plant is moved from a basement to a field, it will experience a drastic change in its environment, which can have both immediate and long-term effects on its growth, development, and overall health. Below are some aspects and changes the plant will encounter when moved from a basement to a field: 1. Sunlight exposure: As per the given fact, if something is outside during the day, it will receive sunlight. Therefore, when the plant is moved from the basement to the field, it will undoubtedly receive sunlight. Sunlight is essential for the process of photosynthesis, where plants convert light energy into chemical energy and produce glucose, which is their primary source of food. This process is critical for the plant's growth, energy production, and overall well-being. 2. Temperature fluctuations: In the field, the plant will experience natural temperature fluctuations throughout the day and night. While in the basement, the temperature may have been relatively stable and possibly cooler. These temperature changes may be an initial stressor for the plant, but eventually, it will adapt to its new environment. This exposure to fluctuating temperatures will also help plants develop resistance to environmental stressors and promote healthy growth. 3. Increased air circulation: Outdoor environments generally have better air circulation compared to basements. Improved air circulation aids in gas exchange for the plant's respiration process and reduces the chances of mold or mildew developing on the plant's leaves. Good airflow also helps regulate the temperature around the plant. 4. Exposure to insects and pollinators: While in the basement, the plant likely had minimal contact with insects. After the plant is moved to the field, it may attract insects and other pollinators, which may help with its reproduction and seed dispersal. However, it might also attract undesirable pests that could harm the plant's health or stunt its growth. 5. Availability of water and nutrients: In the basement, the plant likely received water and nutrients from a controlled source. In the field, its access to these resources will be dependent on rainfall, soil composition, and competition from other plants. However, outdoor soil usually contains a greater diversity and abundance of nutrients compared to indoor potting soil. 6. Competition: In the field, the plant will face competition from other plants for sunlight, water, and nutrients. This competition may initially slow down its growth, but it can also encourage the plant to develop stronger root systems, produce more extensive foliage, and grow taller, resulting in a more robust plant. 7. Adaptation period: The plant may undergo a period of stress and adjustment as it acclimates to its new environment. During this time, the plant may exhibit symptoms such as wilting, dropping leaves, or slowed growth. However, with proper care and monitoring, it should adapt to the new conditions and resume healthy growth. In conclusion, moving a plant from a basement to a field will significantly change its environmental conditions. The plant will receive sunlight, which plays a crucial role in its ability to carry out photosynthesis and support its growth and development. Additionally, it will be exposed to temperature fluctuations, insects, and pollinators, and will face competition for resources. Although there may be an initial adaptation period, the plant will likely flourish in its new environment, resulting in a stronger, healthier plant."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On a rainy, windy night, Seattle started off strong with RB Shaun Alexander getting a three-yard TD run for the only score of the first quarter. The 49ers offense was almost nonexistent in the first half, as seven of San Francisco's first eight drives ended in three-and-outs. However, the Seahawks still allowed a 39-yard field goal by Niners kicker Joe Nedney near the end of the half. After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle's defense started giving way. 49ers QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Davis combined with an excellent kickoff return by Nate Burleson gave Seattle prime field position at the San Francisco 33-yard line. However, the Seahawks failed to convert on a fourth down play on the first series from scrimmage, and turned the ball over on downs. Smith would take advantage by driving his team downfield and completing a 20-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore. San Francisco delivered the final blow with Smith running for an 18-yard TD on a naked bootleg with no defenders near him. The Seahawks got a 22-yard touchdown from QB Matt Hasselbeck to TE Jerramy Stevens with under two minutes left, but it wouldn't be enough as Seattle would get swept by the 49ers.

Here is a goal: Paint a the outside of a large shed. How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Accomplishing the goal of painting the outside of a large shed involves multiple steps, gathering the necessary tools and materials, preparing the shed surface, and executing the painting process properly. The following is a detailed guide to help you successfully complete this task: 1. Assess the shed: Begin by evaluating the size and condition of the shed, noting any damages, areas with peeling paint, or signs of mold and mildew. This assessment will help you determine the supplies, quantity of paint, and time needed to complete the painting job effectively. 2. Gather tools and materials: Based on your assessment, compile a list of the necessary tools and materials for the job. Essential supplies typically include: - Paint (Choose a high-quality paint that is suitable for outdoor use and specifically designed for exterior wood surfaces.) - Primer (if required for a better finish or if there are significant damages to the surface) - Paintbrushes (A combination of wide and narrow brushes will help you cover large areas and reach tight corners.) - Paint rollers and extension poles (for faster painting and easy reach to high areas) - Paint tray - Ladder (depending on the height of the shed) - Drop cloths or plastic sheets (to protect the ground and nearby objects during the painting process) - Masking or painter’s tape (for protecting window panes, handles, or other non-paintable surfaces) - Sandpaper or an electric sander (for surface preparation) - Putty knife and wood filler (to repair damages and imperfections) - Wire brush (for removing loose paint and debris) - Protective gear (gloves, goggles, and coveralls) 3. Prepare the surface: Proper surface preparation is essential for a smooth, long-lasting paint job. Begin by cleaning the exterior of the shed using a brush or a hose to remove dust, dirt, and debris. Next, use sandpaper or an electric sander to roughen the surface and remove any peeling or chipping paint, taking extra care around windows and other trim areas. Repair any imperfections or damages with a putty knife and wood filler according to the filler's instructions. If mold or mildew is present, clean the affected areas with a mixture of bleach and water. Allow the surface to dry completely before proceeding with the painting process. 4. Prime if necessary: If the shed's current paint is in poor condition or if you're using a significantly different color of paint, applying a coat of primer can improve paint adhesion and ensure a smoother result. Use a brush or roller to apply the primer, starting at the top of the shed and working your way down. Cover the entire surface, including trim and corners, and allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer's recommended drying time. 5. Paint: Before applying paint, use masking or painter's tape to cover any areas you don't want to be painted, such as window frames, handles, or hardware. Lay down drop cloths or plastic sheets to protect the surrounding area from drips and spills. Begin painting at the top of the shed, using a brush or roller to apply the paint in smooth, even strokes. Work in sections, moving methodically from left to right and top to bottom to ensure an even application. Be mindful of drips, blends, and streaks as you paint, taking care to correct them as you progress. Use a smaller brush or edging tool to paint trim, corners, and other hard-to-reach areas. Apply the first coat of paint and allow it to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions, then assess the coverage and apply a second coat if needed. It's essential to wait for the paint to dry entirely between coats to achieve the best possible result. 6. Clean up: Once the final coat of paint is dry, carefully remove the masking or painter's tape and clean your brushes, rollers, and other tools according to the paint manufacturer's recommendations. Properly dispose of empty paint cans, used drop cloths, and other waste materials. Store any leftover paint for future touch-ups or color matching. 7. Inspect and touch-up: Perform a final inspection of the painted shed, looking for any imperfections, missed spots, or areas in need of additional touch-ups. If any touch-ups are required, use a small brush or applicator to carefully apply paint to the affected areas. 8. Maintenance: To preserve the appearance and longevity of the shed paint, regularly clean the exterior and address any damages or signs of wear as they become apparent. By following these steps, you can successfully accomplish the goal of painting the outside of a large shed, resulting in a well-protected, aesthetically pleasing structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There were 208 people on the \\"Bulgaria\\" at the time of the accident Sunday, of whom 79 were rescued. Divers have checked all the boat's compartments, the ministry said, and are now looking for more bodies around the boat as well downstream on the Volga River, where they could have been carried by the current. The area where search efforts continue has been enlarged to 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the scene, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said at a briefing Friday. Preparations are under way for the cruise ship to be raised from the river bottom in the coming days. Two large boat cranes, one from Moscow and another one from Volgograd, which will be used for the lifting, are on the way to the accident site. \\"We have asked the Emergency Situations Ministry to keep 23 divers at the scene to continue the search for bodies even during the lifting operation,\\" Levitin said. Specialist military divers were brought in mid-week to aid in the search efforts.

Solve -17*o = 22*o - 18*o - 588 for o.","completion":"To solve the equation -17 * o = 22 * o - 18 * o - 588 for o, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining like terms on the right side. The right side of the equation has two terms with the variable o: 22 * o and -18 * o. We can combine these terms to simplify the equation: -17 * o = (22 * o - 18 * o) - 588 -17 * o = 4 * o - 588 Step 2: Get o terms on one side of the equation. Now, we'll get all o terms on the same side of the equation. In this case, let's move the -17 * o from the left side to the right side. To do this, we'll add 17 * o to both sides of the equation: -17 * o + 17 * o = 4 * o - 588 + 17 * o 0 * o = 21 * o - 588 Step 3: Isolate o. Now, we need to isolate the variable o. To do this, we'll add 588 to both sides of the equation: 21 * o - 588 + 588 = 0 + 588 21 * o = 588 Step 4: Solve for o. Finally, to find the value of o, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 21: 21 * o / 21 = 588 / 21 o = 28 The solution to the given equation is o = 28."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel. Please answer this question : Which friend had a lower risk of developing cancer of the throat?","completion":"Randy, the friend who quit smoking 25 years ago, had a lower risk of developing cancer of the throat compared to Tom who had been smoking tobacco for the past 20 years. The hint provided highlights the fact that many different chemical substances cause cancer, and dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, such as nicotine, have been proven to cause cancer. Tobacco smoke is indeed one of the primary sources of chemical carcinogens, and smoking tobacco significantly increases the risk of developing various types of cancer, including cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Since Tom continued smoking tobacco throughout the years, his exposure to the harmful chemical carcinogens found in tobacco smoke placed him at a higher risk of developing throat cancer compared to Randy, who had quit smoking several years before their meeting. By quitting smoking, Randy had effectively reduced his exposure to these carcinogens and therefore decreased his risk of developing tobacco-related cancers, including cancer of the throat. Moreover, the body begins to heal and repair itself once a person quits smoking, further lowering the risk of developing health problems related to tobacco use. In conclusion, between the two friends, Randy had a lower risk of developing cancer of the throat due to his decision to quit smoking 25 years ago, while Tom, who continued smoking tobacco, was exposed to a higher number of chemical carcinogens, increasing his risk for developing various types of cancer, including throat cancer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Fed’s Move Helps Mood on the Street There was something for just about everyone in the Federal Reserves decision yesterday to cut its benchmark interest rate by half a point. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange after hearing that the Federal Reserve had decided to cut its main interest rate. For homeowners, it could lead to lower mortgage rates in the months to come. For investors, it could help stabilize and bolster volatile share prices. For Wall Street financiers and for companies across America, it could eventually make borrowing easier and cheaper. This is a bold move, said James T. Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management, a mutual fund company in Boston. Its going to alleviate concerns that the credit market will kill the economy. But while the news was welcomed by many, the reaction was not universally upbeat. Economists and market specialists cautioned that the cut would take time to work through the system. It could stoke inflation and send the dollar tumbling, especially if it is followed by another cut in the coming months. And the move may do little to help families who are confronted with rising mortgage payments, falling home prices and a weaker job market. Furthermore, unexpected problems could yet emerge in the complex investments that were popular with banks and hedge funds. The rate cut, to 4.75 percent, was twice as large as most investors had expected, and it showed in the markets reaction. The Standard & Poors 500-stock index rose 2.92 percent, to 1,519.78, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 335.97 points, or 2.51 percent, to 13,739.39. It was the biggest single-day gain for both indexes since early 2003. Wall Streets enthusiasm spilled into Asia this morning. Japans benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index soared 531.49 points, or 3.36 percent, to 16,333.29 points on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at the close of morning trading. In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index jumped 733.05 points, or 2.98 percent, to 25,309.9 in early trading after rising as much as 3.72 percent minutes after the market opened. Many commercial banks followed the Fed and cut the prime rate they charge their best customers for loans. In the commodity markets, gold and oil prices both surged yesterday afternoon. The dollar fell to a new low against the euro. Investors in the futures market are now betting that the Fed will cut rates at least once more this year, to 4.5 percent, at the meeting in late October. But the central bank was more guarded. Noting that some inflation risks remain, the Fed said that its actions would have to balance concerns about slowing growth against the threat of inflation. For the broader economy, changes in the Feds target short-term interest rate, which banks charge one another, usually takes several months to a year to have a noticeable impact. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage stood at 6.31 percent last week, down from its high for the year of 6.74 percent in June, Freddie Mac said. The rate could fall further if the Feds move and statement encourage investors to buy more mortgage-backed securities, which are used to finance loans. There is some indication that investors may have a bigger appetite as a result of the Feds actions. The premium that investors demand to hold bonds issued by corporations and agencies like Fannie Mae, the big buyer of home loans, over Treasuries narrowed noticeably yesterday. The key is going to be whether this cut sparks risk appetite, said Binky Chadha, chief United States equity strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York. And the last two hours suggests that it is clearly doing that. Since the credit squeeze began in late July, some on Wall Street have been clamoring for the Fed to cut interest rates and ease the flow of money in the financial system. Perhaps the most colorful display of that sentiment came in early August when Jim Cramer, the CNBC talk-show host and a former hedge fund manager, railed against the Fed and said the central banks chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has no idea how bad it is out there. Mr. Bernanke and the Fed, for their part, stayed above the fray, in an effort that many bank watchers say was intended to avoid the perception that policy makers would bail out investors who made bad bets. The Fed then cut the discount rate it charged to lend money directly to banks, and it stepped up its lending activities to ensure that the Fed funds rate remained at or below the previous target of 5.25 percent. Those measures, coupled with a growing belief that the Fed was poised to cut interest rates, injected some optimism into the market in recent weeks. Before yesterdays announcement, the S.& P. 500 index, for instance, was up nearly 5 percent from Aug. 15. That essentially put the index back to where it was after policy makers decided in early August to keep rates unchanged. In the credit markets, the adjustment has been somewhat slower. The commercial paper market for short-term debt remains tight, though borrowing costs for companies and banks that use those loans have been trending lower. The premium that investors demand to hold corporate and high-yield bonds has narrowed, though it remains far wider than it was early this year. Jeremy W. Peters and Eric Dash contributed reporting. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"This news article talks all about how the \\"Federal Reserve\\", which is like the country's money headmaster, decided to lower its benchmark interest rate. You can imagine this rate as the cost to borrow money. The Federal Reserve lowered it by half a point, which means borrowing money got a little bit cheaper. This decision affects a lot of people. Homeowners may get to pay less for their mortgage, which is the money they owe for their houses. Investors might be happy too, because the prices of their shares may go up. Wall Street financiers and companies might find it cheaper and easier to borrow money. But the article also says not everyone is happy about the lower interest rate. Some people worry it might cause inflation, which is like when your favorite candy suddenly costs more money at the store. This might make the dollar worth less compared to other countries' money. Plus, it might not help families who are having a hard time paying their mortgages or finding jobs. After the Federal Reserve cut the interest rate, the stock market, where people buy and sell pieces of companies, went up a lot, which is super good if you own shares in companies. Same thing happened in the stock market in Japan and Hong Kong. But just because the Federal Reserve lowered the rate now doesn't mean it will keep doing it. They will watch to make sure they don't cause more inflation. This decision may take several months to a year to see its real impact, much like planting seeds and waiting for them to grow into plants!

The sentence also goes on to provide additional information about the scale's inclusion in a subsequent book titled \\"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\\" published in 1953. The Kinsey scale is a groundbreaking tool in understanding human sexuality. Prior to its publication, research and discussions surrounding sexual orientation were often limited and oversimplified. The scale aimed to change the perception of sexual orientation from a pure dichotomy (heterosexual or homosexual) into a continuum or spectrum. It assigned individuals a rating from 0 to 6, with 0 being exclusively heterosexual, 6 being exclusively homosexual, and scores in between representing varying degrees of bisexuality. Alfred Kinsey, along with his colleagues Wardell Pomeroy and Clyde Martin, founded the Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University (later renamed the Kinsey Institute) to study human sexual behavior. Their groundbreaking research and publications, including the aforementioned books, have had a lasting impact on various aspects of sexology, from psychology to sociology, providing valuable insights into the diversity and complexity of human sexuality. The introduction of the Kinsey scale played an essential role in the study of human sexuality, pushing researchers and society at large to reassess traditional notions of sexual orientation. By demonstrating that human sexuality exists on a spectrum, the scale has helped reduce stigma and foster a more inclusive understanding of diverse sexual identities and experiences. In conclusion, the provided sentence not only answers the question about when the Kinsey scale was first published but also gives context about its inclusion in two important publications and its impact on the understanding of human sexuality. The Kinsey scale was first published in 1948, in the book \\"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\\" by Alfred Kinsey, Wardell Pomeroy, and Clyde Martin, and later featured in \\"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\\" (1953)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Madrid dominated from the start and led when Casemiro - who earlier hit the bar - slid in a half volley. They doubled their lead when Isco calmly slotted in from eight yards after a neat one-two with Gareth Bale, who started ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo. New £75m striker Romelu Lukaku tapped in before Marcus Rashford scuffed wide. The Europa League winners were given encouragement by Lukaku's strike, despite rarely threatening the Madrid goal in the previous hour, and could have scored a barely deserved equaliser through half-time substitute Rashford with nine minutes left. United were unable to create another clear-cut chance as Madrid became the first team to retain the Super Cup since 1990. With temperatures over 30C in the Macedonian capital, the match was twice stopped for scheduled cooling breaks implemented by governing body Uefa. The Red Devils have spent £146m this summer on Everton striker Lukaku (£75m), Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic (£40m) and Benfica defender Victor Lindelof (£31m) as they look to improve on a disappointing sixth-placed finish in the Premier League last season. All three new signings started as Mourinho named a strong side against the European champions. Only Ronaldo was missing from the Madrid team which started their victory against Juventus in the Champions League final, providing a stern test for Mourinho's new-look side. But United struggled against the continent's best, particularly in the first half, as Madrid controlled the tempo with their crisp and purposeful passing. The English side were unable to effectively keep possession before half-time - managing just 39% of the ball - and mustered only one shot on target when Lukaku headed straight at Madrid keeper Keylor Navas. Mourinho introduced teenager Rashford at the break, looking to stretch the Spanish club - who the Portuguese boss managed between 2010 and 2013 - on the break. Although the Red Devils did improve in the second half, they still looked well short of being able to compete with Europe's most talented sides going into their return to the Champions League this season. Madrid continued to create chances throughout. Bale smashed against the bar when the score was 2-0, while David de Gea also produced superb saves to stop Toni Kroos, Karim Benzema and Marco Asensio. On the eve of the match, United manager Mourinho said he will \\"fight with other coaches\\" to sign Bale if Madrid are willing to sell the Wales forward. However, he added the former Tottenham winger starting for Madrid in Skopje would be \\"the clearest signal that he is staying there\\". Well, Bale started. In truth it was always going to be likely as Ronaldo - who came on as a late substitute - only returned to full training at the weekend after being given an extended summer break following Portugal's involvement in the Confederations Cup. Bale insists he wants to stay at the Bernabeu, but struggled to make a major impact in an injury-hit campaign as Madrid won the Spanish La Liga title and Champions League last season. The former Southampton player had a chance to prove his worth to Zinedine Zidane as he started up front alongside Karim Benzema. He instinctively fired over early on, then set up Isco with a perfectly weighted pass before smashing a rising right-footed drive against the bar. Bale, who was brought off after 75 minutes, will be pleased with his contribution in an impressive team performance. However, if Madrid do sign exciting Monaco teenager Kylian Mbappe then it would appear Bale could become a peripheral figure at the Bernabeu. After the game, Bale said he has not been told he can leave. \\"I'm just concentrating on football and not listening to anything,\\" he said. \\"I'm enjoying myself playing here.\\" Competitive top-level European club games rarely include drink breaks, but they were implemented by Uefa in Skopje after temperatures remained over 30C during the match. A heatwave nicknamed 'Lucifer' has hit southern Europe with temperatures in the Macedonian capital regularly rising above 40C this week. The match paused twice - once at the 30-minute mark and again after 72 minutes - for both sets of players to rehydrate. Both managers used the pair of two-minute breaks to gather their players around and issue some tactical instructions. Bale said he felt his team coped well with the heat, adding: \\"It helped we have been training in 38C heat in Madrid.\\" Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \\"I think we did well. We lost 2-1 which, I think, shows the result was really short, and one of the goals was offside so with a good VAR [video assistant referee] it would be 1-1 and extra time. \\"I think they could score more goals than they did, we could score more goals than we did. They had a period of dominance in the middle of the first half, we had a period of dominance in the middle of the second half and some balance in the beginning of the game. \\"We were playing against a team of fantastic players and we discussed the result until almost the end, not the end but almost the end.\\" United, who finished 24 points adrift of champions Chelsea last season, start the new Premier League campaign when they host West Ham United at Old Trafford on Sunday (16:00 BST).

Two people were killed early Monday in Miramar when the disabled vehicle they were pushing along Pembroke Road was struck by a second vehicle. (Jim Donnelly/correspondent) (Jim Donnelly/correspondent) The crash was a close call for three others, including BMW driver Giovanni Martinez, 19, of Miramar, who was injured and flown to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood. The hospital said Martinez was in good condition and was expected to be discharged late Monday. The crash happened shortly after 1 a.m. along Pembroke Road, east of Dykes Road where it dead ends near the west side of Interstate 75, behind the Silver Shores community where Martinez lives. Martinez was steering the BMW with help from Mosaphir, Camps and another friend, Justin Molina, 18, also of Miramar. Gregory Vasquez, 21, of Miramar had stopped to help. The luxury car was pushed east about 20 blocks before it was struck in the rear and driver's side by an SUV driven by Asia Valentine, 23, also of Miramar, police said. Molina and Vasquez were not hurt, Miramar Police spokeswoman Tania Rues said. Raul Molina, 41, who lives nearby and rushed to the scene said, \\"It's every parent's worst nightmare to get that call.\\" Molina said when his son, Mosaphir and Camps were called by Martinez, they went to Pembroke Road to help. \\"Jonah [Mosaphir] was pushing from behind the car with [Vasquez],\\" he said. \\"[Camps] was standing next to my son when it happened and the car was inches away from my son, [who] said he could feel the breeze of the car passing.\\" Of Mosaphir and Camps, Molina said, \\"When I saw police covering the bodies, I knew they didn't survive the accident.\\" Valentine remained at the scene and has cooperated fully, Rues said. The investigation will continue in coming days and it was too soon for authorities to say whether any charges would be filed, she said. There are conflicting accounts about whether the BMW's lights were on when the SUV struck it. Survivors say the car's lights were on; Valentine told investigators she did not see the BMW or any car lights, Rues said. \\"Several cars did pass this vehicle and saw the teens pushing the car,\\" Rues said. \\"However, this occurred on Pembroke Road — closer to Dykes — near Silver Shores Elementary School and near Silver Shores Park, where there are street lights on. Once you pass the park, the area becomes very dark.\\" The sedan's rear lights may have been blocked by the helpers' bodies, she said. \\"When the first traffic officer responded to the scene, he stated that the area was very dark, the vehicle was shut off at that time and the lights were not on,\\" Rues said. The initial investigation shows the SUV swerved, attempting to prevent the accident, according to Rues. Justin Molina and Mosaphir had been best friends at Westland Hialeah Senior High School and were college classmates, Molina's father said. \\"I just want Jonah to be remembered as a very good kid,\\" Raul Molina said. \\"He had a heart of gold and that's the reason why he was there.\\" Reached by phone Monday, Mosaphir's mother said she was unable to talk. Several generations ago in Cuba, the Camps and Mosaphir families became close when Camps ancestors helped raise a girl whose parents had died, Roman said. The couple, who were friends for a year before becoming sweethearts, later found out about that connection, another tie that bound them. They enjoyed dining out with friends, outings that she would organize. Camps also doted on her toddler niece and nephew, her sister Lauren Tejera's children, the family said. \\"[Jonah] was honest, highly intelligent, a good kid,\\" Roman said. \\"He adored her and was very good to her. She loved him very much.\\" Roman said the families have spoken since receiving the terrible news. \\"We want to do their services together, and bury them together if we can,\\" she said.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who sneaks out through a back door? Joe Martin is a fire fighter in Los Angeles who is assigned by his department chief to the Arson Detail. His first assignment is to investigate a suspicious fur store fire that seems to be set by the store owner himself, Thomas Peyson. The reason why Joe Martin gets the assignment is because his predecessor in the Arson Detail was killed when inspecting the very same fire site. The predessor's file with his findings wasn't found on his body and hasn't been recovered. This is just one of many equally suspicious fires in the last few years, where the insurance claims following the fires has been filed by the same agent, Frederick P. Fender. There is suspicion that Fender is somehow involved in the disappearance of all the destroyed stores' goods as well. Joe begins with Peyson, the store owner, and visits his apartment that was also raged by fire not long ago. He meets the baby-sitter, Jane, a pretty young teacher, and they get along so well that Joe drives her home and ask her out on a date the next evening. It turns out Peyson and Fender is in cahoots together, since the first thing Peyson does after Joe leaves, is phone his accomplice. They also meet up the day after, just when Joe comes to see Fender as the next logical step in his investigation. Joe never sees Peyson, as he sneaks out through a back door. Joe gets very little information of use from Fender, but his visit makes Fender put one of his men, Pete, on tailing Joe to see if he finds out something. Pete starts following Joe around everywhere he goes, even when he visits Jane.

Given the question: Given the below context: During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Yes, if U.S. companies begin entering previously closed markets, it is reasonable to conclude that \\"Many US companies are going to enter markets that were previously locked away.\\" This statement essentially restates the information provided and indicates that numerous U.S. companies will be expanding into new markets that were not previously accessible. Entering previously closed markets generally means that the markets were either restricted or inaccessible due to certain regulatory, legal, or political barriers. These barriers may have existed due to trade regulations, foreign investment constraints, or government policies that controlled market entry. However, when these barriers are removed or reduced, U.S. companies have the opportunity to navigate and leverage these newly opened markets to expand their global presence. Expanding into new markets provides U.S. companies with a range of potential benefits such as access to new customers, increased revenues, improved brand recognition, and creation of new partnerships and alliances. Furthermore, entering these markets may lead to additional growth opportunities in the global economy, as well as better competition on a global scale. In conclusion, when U.S. companies plan to enter previously closed markets, it is accurate to say that \\"Many US companies are going to enter markets that were previously locked away.\\" This suggests that a significant number of companies from the United States are prepared to leverage new opportunities provided by the opening of these markets, posing an exciting prospect for future growth and expansion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: To prevent the rainbow bread from sticking to your work surface while kneading How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To successfully accomplish the goal of preventing rainbow bread dough from sticking to your work surface while kneading, several key steps and strategies should be followed: 1. **Choose the Right Surface:** The first step is to ensure you have the right surface for kneading. This can greatly affect how much the dough sticks. Hardwood, granite, marble, or stainless steel surfaces can be good choices. Make sure the surface is clean and dry before you start. 2. **Properly Prep the Surface:** Use a dusting of flour on your kneading surface. This will act as a barrier between the dough and the counter, reducing the likelihood of sticking. But be careful not to use too much flour that will significantly alter the bread's consistency. A light dusting should suffice. 3. **Oil the Surface:** Alternatively, you can apply a light layer of oil to your hands and work surface. A little oil can prevent the dough from sticking without adding extra dry ingredients into your dough. It's better to opt for neutral oils so as to not alter the taste of your rainbow bread. 4. **Chill the Dough:** Another technique is to chill the dough in the refrigerator before you begin kneading. Cold dough tends to be less sticky. Just be sure to factor this into your proofing time, as cold dough will take longer to rise. 5. **Gradual Kneading:** Rather than plopping the entire dough onto your surface and starting to knead, tear off manageable pieces, and knead them one at a time. This prevents the entire mass from sticking on the surface while enabling you to gradually adjust the dough's consistency. 6. **Regular Cleaning:** It is important to clean your surface in between kneading intervals if you are working with a large quantity of dough this reduces the chance of excess dough sticking to your workspace. 7. **Work Quickly:** The longer the dough sits in one place, the more it will stick. Try to knead and rotate the dough continually so it doesn't have time to stick. Using the heel of your hand to push and fold the dough can be an effective kneading method that minimizes sticking. 8. **Proper Hydration:** If your dough is overly hydrated, it may stick more. Ensure that your dough has the proper balance of dry and wet ingredients based on the recipe you’re using. If it gets too sticky, slowly add more flour, a spoonful at a time, until it reaches the right consistency. 9. **Use of Dough Scrapers:** Consider using a dough scraper, a flat, flexible piece of metal or plastic that effectively unsticks dough and also helps in gathering and lifting the dough when kneading. They are cheap, effective, and make cleanup a breeze. 10. **Use of Silicone Mat:** One final strategy might be using a silicone mat specifically designed for kneading and rolling dough. These mats provide a non-stick surface and are easy to clean up after your bread preparation. Achieving the right consistency with dough takes practice. If you’re new to baking, don’t be discouraged if your dough sticks a bit at first. With each bake, you’ll get a feel for the dough and how to handle it. The important thing is to keep experimenting and learn what works best for you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Choices: (1). comfortable (2). more anxious (3). would be angry The answer is:","completion":"(1). comfortable There are several reasons why Cameron would feel comfortable in this scenario when being treated by Jesse, a therapist, for stress. First and foremost, therapists like Jesse are professionally trained to create a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment for their clients. They employ various techniques, such as active listening, empathy, non-judgmental exploration, and problem-solving, to build trust and rapport with their clients. This trusting relationship is crucial for clients like Cameron to openly express their emotions and feelings connected to stress. Second, Cameron is actively seeking help for their stress, which demonstrates their willingness to address and work on the issue. As a result, they would likely feel comfortable discussing their stressors with Jesse, knowing that they are taking steps towards better emotional well-being by seeking professional assistance. Third, Jesse would be equipped to teach Cameron various stress management techniques, such as relaxation exercises, mindfulness, cognitive reframing, and time management. These tools would not only help Cameron feel more comfortable and at ease in their daily lives but provide them with a sense of empowerment and competence in coping with stress. Lastly, therapy sessions are typically conducted in a private and confidential setting, allowing the client to express their emotions and thoughts freely without external judgment or pressure.

By the beginning of the 8th century, the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture. One feature of the basilica is the use of a transept, or the \\"arms\\" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave.

Given the below context: Johnny English is a kindhearted but inept MI7 secret agent with dreams of being their most trusted employee. After Agent One dies in a submarine accident unknowingly caused by English, the remaining agents are assassinated via a bombing at Agent One's funeral, leaving English as the lone surviving agent capable of finishing the mission Agent One left when he died. English is assigned to thwart a plot to steal the Crown Jewels, which are on display at the Tower of London. During the display, the power suddenly suffers a blackout and the jewels are stolen. During the chaos, English accidentally knocks out the deputy head of security and pretends to fight an assailant to make up for his mistakes. He later makes up a false description of the \\"assailant\\" to MI7 head Pegasus. English and his assistant Angus Bough find that the jewels were removed via a hole dug beneath their display case. The two follow a tunnel where they confront the two thieves Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, who escape in a hearse, with English trying to pursue them but he mistakes another hearse for the escaped vehicle to which he accidentally gatecrashes a funeral until Bough comes to his aid by pretending English is an escaped mental patient. English connects the thieves to Pascal Sauvage, a French prison entrepreneur who helped restore the Crown Jewels. Pegasus finds the claims of his involvement absurd and warns English not to involve Sauvage. In the car park, English and Bough are attacked by Vendetta but are unharmed. English again encounters Lorna in a sushi restaurant as he recognized her pink motorcycle. During their meeting, English is suspicious of her since he has seen her at two of their crime scenes and her records cannot be found on any government computer. English and Bough then decide to break into Sauvage's headquarters via parachutes, but English mistakenly lands on a visually identical tower which turns out to be the City Hospital.

I try to control masturbation, but when I do it for over 2 weeks, it often results in nightfall. What are the pros and cons of this? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"To analyze whether masturbation is the reason why some teenagers are not able to gain weight, and to understand the pros and cons of masturbation and nightfall, I will first research the available scientific evidence and expert opinions on these matters. Step 1: Research on masturbation and its effects on weight gain - According to several studies and healthcare professionals, there isn't any direct correlation between masturbation and an inability to gain weight. Masturbation is a normal, healthy practice that doesn't negatively affect body weight. However, excessive masturbation could potentially lead to fatigue and lack of energy, which may indirectly affect a person's overall health and well-being. Step 2: List the pros and cons of masturbation Pros of masturbation: 1. Relieves stress and promotes relaxation. 2. Helps improve sleep quality. 3. May enhance self-esteem and body image. 4. Provides a safe, natural outlet for sexual tension and desire. 5. Can help individuals better understand their sexual preferences and improve their sexual experiences with partners. Cons of masturbation: 1. If done excessively, it could interfere with daily activities and relationships. 2. Some individuals may experience guilt or shame due to cultural, religious, or societal beliefs. 3. Excessive masturbation may potentially cause skin irritation or injury. 4. Some individuals may develop an addiction to pornography. Step 3: Address the issue of nightfall - Nightfall, also known as nocturnal emission or wet dream, is a natural and involuntary ejaculation that occurs during sleep. It is considered a natural part of growing up and is not harmful to one's health. Step 4: List the pros and cons of nightfall Pros of nightfall: 1. It is a natural process that is often associated with the development of a healthy reproductive system in adolescents. 2. Helps maintain a balance of sexual hormones. 3. May provide relief from sexual tension and desire built-up over time. Cons of nightfall: 1. Some people may experience embarrassment or discomfort due to wet dreams, particularly if they are not aware of the phenomenon. 2. Excessive nightfall may be linked to an underlying health issue, such as hormonal imbalances or prostate problems. In this case, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional. After analyzing the given information, I can conclude that these questions are not the same, although they are related. The first question focuses on masturbation and its potential effects on weight gain, while also asking for the pros and cons of masturbation. The second question focuses on controlling masturbation that may lead to nightfall and asks for the pros and cons of nightfall. Both questions address sexual health topics but focus on different aspects of it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

People everywhere are curious what the ads refer to, and even Malcolm Tauber the head of the company Hanlon works for, is in the dark. It's revealed that Tauber's assistant (and Hanlon's girlfriend) Gwen Hughes has created some secret sketches of women's fashion for Tex that will be used in the final Three Springs ad. However, other forces are at work. Attracted by the attention given the campaign, Renee Beauchamps asks for a chance to begin work with Hanlon. He agrees, but begins to receive threatening notes related to The Three Springs. A passing motorist, Julian Leighton, picks him up and offers him twenty-thousand dollars to spill the secret. Another wealthy man, Alexander Cardovsky, also asks for information. He's later pressured by two thugs, Mr. Warren and Bert to reveal everything. He buys a toy puppet from a poor woman, Jenny, and finds another note in the toy, asking him to meet her. When he does, he discovers Jenny has been murdered, and he's been set up to take the blame.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. According to the above context, answer the following question. When do people use broad brushstrokes according to the author? Answer:","completion":"People use broad brushstrokes when they are asked to define themselves. They typically consult their internal list of attributes or interests, such as being creative, outgoing, or having hobbies like photography or playing the guitar, to quickly describe themselves without fully processing the question. This approach might not reveal the full essence of the person since it doesn't take into account the everyday actions that actually shape their lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Romanian Romanian:","completion":"În opinia mea, este într-o oarecare măsură un dezavantaj faptul că rapoartele trimestriale emise de IPCC privind aspectele materiale legate de schimbările climatice și privind adaptările și atenuările au între 1200 și 1400 de pagini, alcătuind o lucrare științifică extrem de detaliată, completată cu referințe la literatura științifică relevantă. Romanian: În opinia mea, reprezintă într-o oarecare măsură un dezavantaj faptul că rapoartele trimestriale publicate de IPCC referitoare la aspectele factuale esențiale legate de schimbările climatice, precum și la adaptări și măsuri de atenuare, cuprind între 1200 și 1400 de pagini. Aceste rapoarte constituie lucrări științifice extrem de detaliate, incluzând referințe la literatura științifică relevantă în acest domeniu. Cel mai bun mod de a explica de ce acest lucru poate fi considerat un dezavantaj este legat de accesibilitatea și înțelegerea acestor rapoarte pentru publicul larg. Aceste documente sunt deseori atât de tehnice și detaliate încât persoanelor care nu sunt familiarizate cu domeniul științei și cercetării privind schimbările climatice le poate fi dificil să extragă informații relevante sau să înțeleagă implicațiile. De asemenea, un alt aspect negativ ar fi timpul și efortul necesar pentru a citi și analiza întregul conținut al raportului. Chiar și pentru experții în domeniu, poate fi o activitate consumatoare de timp să se angajeze în studierea riguroasă a tuturor detaliilor și referințelor incluse în raport. Acest lucru poate duce la întârzieri în dezbatere și luarea deciziilor legate de climă și mediul înconjurător, deoarece totul trebuie studiat în profunzime înainte de a putea lua măsuri. Pe de altă parte, un argument în favoarea dimensiunii și detaliilor rapoartelor ar fi faptul că ele oferă o bază solidă și bine documentată pentru știința din spatele schimbărilor climatice. Aceasta înseamnă că experții și decidenții care își iau timp pentru a înțelege conținutul rapoartelor vor avea acces la o cantitate enormă de informații, care să le permită să ia decizii informate și bine fundamentate. În concluzie, în timp ce rapoartele IPCC extrem de detaliate și lungi pot constitui un dezavantaj în ceea ce privește accesibilitatea și înțelegerea pentru publicul larg, ele oferă totuși o abordare cuprinzătoare și bine documentată a științei referitoare la schimbările climatice. Poate că o soluție pentru acest dezavantaj ar fi dezvoltarea unor rapoarte suplimentare sau documente de sinteză, care să prezinte informații cheie și aspecte relevante într-un format mai accesibil și mai ușor de înțeles pentru publicul larg, fără a compromite baza științifică solidă a acestor informații."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Beginning in the late 1970’s, ozone depletion was recognized as a significant environmental issue. The most dramatic decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over the continent of Antarctica. The size and duration of the ozone hole steadily increased, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. Fortunately, most countries have recognized the danger of CFCs and dramatically curtailed their use in recent years. It is hoped that ozone depletion will slow and that the ozone layer may eventually be restored to its earlier levels. and the situation: Factories around the world produce lots of CFCs which deplete the ozone layer. One year a large number of these factories decided they would implement efforts to reduce the amount of CFCs they release into the atmosphere. As a result the depletion of the ozone layer greatly decreased. However, the companies realized that this was hurting profits too much and reverted their decision. As a result the ozone layer began to rapidly deplete again. Answer the following question: Will reducing the amount of CFCs released into the atmosphere increase or decrease ozone depletion?

Please segment the words.","completion":"Better information on liability: In a plain and intelligible language, consumers will need to be informed that the organiser is responsible for the proper performance of all included services. Whereas today, diverging national rules concerning the responsible party (organiser, retailer or both) lead to a situation where organisers and retailers refer the consumer to the other party, neither of them taking responsibility. In this statement, it becomes evident that there is a need for clearer and more straightforward communication of responsibility between the consumer, organizer, and retailer for a comprehensive understanding of liability issues. Presently, many national rules are ambiguous, which creates confusion in determining the responsible party. This becomes problematic when all the parties involved try to deflect their responsibility toward the others, resulting in a lack of accountability. Improving the information on liability and presenting it in plain and intelligible language will significantly benefit consumers in comprehending the rules and responsibilities involved in their transactions. This, in turn, will help prevent situations where they are left without proper recourse when facing issues related to the products or services they have purchased or engaged in. Moreover, it is crucial to establish consistent and transparent rules regarding the responsible parties, be it the organiser, retailer, or both, so that consumers can rely on these rules when making informed decisions. A harmonized approach towards setting such rules will make it easier for consumers to understand their rights and obligations, leading to increased trust in the market. In conclusion, better information on liability in a plain and intelligible language is vital to enhance the consumer's understanding and trust, ensuring all parties' responsibilities are clearly defined.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] I am facing a new situation today: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit.

Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruits would not develop unfavorable osmotic pressure, bowl A or bowl B? A:","completion":"Bowl B would not develop unfavorable osmotic pressure. This is because the fruits in bowl A are glace fruits, which have been saturated with sugar through the process of drenching them in syrup.

The pair have been reunited on television for the first time since their 2008 prank on BBC Radio 2, as the comedian appeared on Ross's ITV1 chat show set for broadcast tomorrow night. But unable to avoid controversy for long, Brand said his friend 'didn't give a monkey's' about the furore caused after they made a series of offensive hoax phone calls to Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sachs.

It implies that they are dressed appropriately for cold weather, which is common for mountainous regions and snowy conditions. 3. \\"Riding on a chair lift\\": This part specifies the activity the women are partaking in. A chair lift is a mechanical system for carrying skiers, snowboarders, or mountain visitors uphill. Chair lifts are most commonly found in ski resorts or mountainous locations. 4. \\"Through snow covered mountains\\": The statement informs about the surroundings and environment of the scene.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Shaw and Crompton is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the South Pennines, 2.3 miles (3.7 km) north of Oldham, 3.6 miles (5.8 km) southeast of Rochdale, and 8.7 miles (14 km) to the northeast of the city of Manchester. It is regularly referred to as Shaw. Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was originally known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated a process of rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, as a result of an interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989. Shaw and Crompton, which covers 4.5 square miles (11.7 km2), is a predominantly suburban area of mixed affluence with a population of 21,065 as of 2011. Its double name has been said to make it \\"distinctive, if not unique\\". The legacy of its...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Use this line as a guide while you perform your cartwheel. You can even use painter’s tape to create a real line across a carpet or a mat. This line should be at least several feet long. Try to stay on the line, as if the line is a balance beam. But do not focus on just the line. Focus on form too. Make sure the area around your line is free and clear. Avoid practicing cartwheels near walls or pieces of furniture that you might run into. Injuries occur when you bump into something hard. Slightly bend your front leg at the knee and keep your back leg straight. Keep both feet pointing forward parallel to your imaginary line. Hold your arms straight up by your ears. A common mistake is to start a cartwheel while facing sideways. Make sure you’re facing forwards as you prepare and start for your cartwheel. That is the correct way. Either leg can be your lead leg. Sometimes, however, it's more comfortable to use one leg instead of the other—you can try to figure out which one by doing a series of handstands, some starting with your right leg in front, others with your left. Whichever leading leg feels more natural is the one you should use for your cartwheel.You can determine your leading by watching which leg in splits feels more comfortable. Keep your arms straight by your ears as you lower them down to bring your head and torso down as well. Only lower your arms about halfway to the ground. Bring your back leg up while keeping it straight so your body forms a “T” shape. This step requires balance. You may need to drop your leg several times before you find a balanced position you can hold. Don’t worry if you’re having trouble balancing. Once you get the hang of the cartwheel, you won’t have to hold this position for very long since it will all become one continuous and natural movement. Put down the arm on the same side of your body as your lead leg first. Then put your other arm down so they're spread about shoulder width apart, similar to the way they would be positioned for a handstand. Place both hands along the imaginary line. Think \\"hand hand feet\\" to help you process the cartwheel. For example, if you lunged with your right leg, place your right hand down first, then your left hand. Keep the fingers of each hand pointing away from your head. Straighten your front leg as you push so your legs end up in the air, pointing straight upwards. Balance your weight on your arms with your hands shoulder-width apart on either side of your head. Keep your head and torso upside down and positioned directly over your arms. Use your shoulders and core for support. You won’t hold this position for long. Cartwheels should be performed in one fluid motion. Make sure to keep your legs straight the whole time. If you are a beginner, then you may want to practice more. To complete the cartwheel, put your leading leg down first along your imaginary line. The first hand you placed on the mat will lift up naturally as your foot comes down. Bring your arm up by your ear to finish the cartwheel. Your weight should start to shift onto your legs. Keep your head and torso roughly parallel to the mat. Your other leg will follow the first as it comes down. Make sure to place your back foot behind your leading foot along the same imaginary line so both feet point back in the direction you came from. Your second hand will lift naturally off the mat, following the first hand. At this point, both your head and torso should be right side up, centered over your legs. A common mistake while cartwheeling is leaving your hands on the ground for too long. Make sure that your arms stay straight and by your ears as your chest and head come up at the end of the cartwheel. Position yourself so your original back leg is in front and slightly bent, while your original leading leg is behind you and straight, just like a lunge. Keep both feet pointing in the direction you came from. Make sure your arms are straight and pointing upwards, next to your ears. Position your torso in the same direction your feet are pointing. Continue to practice your cartwheel, alternating back and forth between leading legs, until you get the hang of it. It may take some time, so don't give up! The form will not matter at first, as long as you are supporting yourself in the air with your handstand getting the hang of it, it's a cartwheel! Just remember to get the form once you can do it in a fluid motion. One direction may be easier than the other for you—most people have a dominant leg. But practice both to get comfortable cartwheeling on either side. Pick one side you would like to do first. If you start to get dizzy or lightheaded at any point, take a break and wait for the feeling to pass before resuming cartwheeling. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform a cartwheel correctly while focusing on form and safety.

The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production and the war industries continued to operate and expand. The Blitz was only authorised when the Luftwaffe had failed to meet preconditions for a 1940 launch of Operation Sea Lion, the provisionally planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East.

To assess the validity of this hypothesis, a thorough examination and comparison of the actions of both President Richard Nixon and President Lyndon B. Johnson would be required. It is important to note that the premise focuses on Nixon's abuse of power, including IRS audits of enemies, spying on private citizens, creating the Plumbers unit that took part in the Watergate break-in and the violation of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office, as well as using federal agencies for personal and political advantage. While the premise informs us about Nixon's alleged abuse of power, it does not offer any direct information about Johnson. Therefore, we cannot decisively say whether Johnson abused power in the same manner as Nixon. To determine if Johnson abused power in a similar way, we would need to examine his presidency, which spanned from November 22, 1963, to January 20, 1969. Some aspects of Johnson's presidency, such as the escalation of the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, and the Great Society programs, could be scrutinized to see if any actions point to an abuse of power. For instance, we could look for evidence of Johnson attempting to silence political opponents, using federal agencies for political gain, or engaging in unauthorized surveillance. Some critics have accused Johnson of employing underhanded tactics and deceit, particularly in domestic policies and international relations. However, to draw a definitive comparison between Johnson and Nixon's abuse, further in-depth research is essential. In conclusion, based on the provided premise, the hypothesis \\"Johnson also abused power in the same way as Nixon\\" cannot be considered true or false due to the lack of information provided about Johnson's actions during his presidency. To arrive at a conclusion, further research and investigation into Johnson’s actions and decisions would be necessary to draw a comprehensive comparison between the two leaders."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Oxidation-reduction reactions are of central importance in organic chemistry and biochemistry. The burning of fuels that provides the energy to maintain our civilization and the metabolism of foods that furnish the energy that keeps us alive both involve redox reactions. All combustion reactions are also redox reactions. A typical combustion reaction is the burning of methane, the principal component of natural gas (Figure 5.5 \\"The Burning of Natural Gas\\"). CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O In respiration, the biochemical process by which the oxygen we inhale in air oxidizes foodstuffs to carbon dioxide and water, redox reactions provide energy to living cells. A typical respiratory reaction is the oxidation of glucose (C6H12O6), the simple sugar we encountered in the chapter-opening essay that makes up the diet of yeast: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O Organic chemists use a variety of redox reactions.

Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, physician and retired politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1979 to 1985, and for Texas's 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States: as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the Republican primaries of 2008 and 2012. Paul is a critic of the federal government's fiscal policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve and the tax policy, as well as the military-industrial complex, and the War on Drugs. He has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programs. Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873-1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress. During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch \\"to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation.\\" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward. Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that \\"Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic.\\" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr. On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader.","completion":"This text is about Ronald Ernest Paul, an American author, physician, and retired politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd and 14th congressional districts and sought the presidency of the United States on three occasions."},{"prompt":"What is the name of the song written by the when the artist who lived in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania when she was 12 years old?

Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients.

The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.

Write a title for this article: As Congress takes up health care reform, the debate is being shaped by countless voices--often strident, sometimes-scaremongering-- about the risks of overhauling the system. Former U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin says the proposed reform will lead to the creation of \\"death panels,\\" with bureaucrats deciding who gets care. Before he died, Sen. Edward Kennedy said quality care shouldn't depend on a person's financial resources. We take a look at the private-vs.-public debate with stories, a slide show and columns from across the spectrum of people in the know. As America agonizes over remaking health care, it might check out a private/public system that has been in place for years--the one in Germany. A novel system drawn up under Spain's public health care system offers a successful solution to the dearth of organ donors. And finds it delivers just as much bang for a far smaller buck. The U.S. president should note that public health care in Britain isn't all it's cracked up to be. The German and French systems, in which doctors abound, are pricier than those of the U.S. and U.K. David Whelan and Anita Raghavan Obamacare is coming, and a lot of Americans find socialized medicine to be scary. But in treating life-threatening disease, the British system isn't as bad as you might have expected. My initial treatment at a public health system was great, but the aftercare was 'une catastrophe.' Tony Benn, the longest-serving MP in the history of Britain's Labour Party, explains why he's a staunch supporter of public health care. The insurance system in America is stifling potential ingenuity and entrepreneurialism. President Obama needs a system that is universal, genuinely competitive and works for its patients. Calm down. Take a pill. (If you can afford it.) Better health care, whether public or private, must focus on innovating medicine. Sadly, most European policymakers and academics have a deep and abiding distrust of the private sector. The sad truth is that health care can never be affordable, high-quality and universal--and its costs are always shared.

Combine like terms: The equation is -35*k + 117*k + 172 = 664. The like terms are -35*k and +117*k, so we'll combine these two terms: (-35*k) + (117*k) = -35k + 117k = 82k Now, rewrite the equation with these combined terms: 82*k + 172 = 664 2. Isolate k: To isolate k on one side of the equation, we must first remove the constant term (+172) from the left side. We do this by subtracting 172 from both sides of the equation: (82 * k + 172) - 172 = 664 - 172 This simplifies to: 82*k = 492 Now that we have 82*k on one side, we'll isolate k by dividing both sides of the equation by 82: (82*k) / 82 = 492 / 82 This simplifies to: k = 6 3. Evaluate the solution: We found that k = 6. Now we'll plug this value back into the original equation to verify our solution. -35*(6) + 117*(6) + 172 = 664 -210 + 702 + 172 = 664 492 + 172 = 664 664 = 664 Our solution is correct.

Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to 10 from 5 and in circuit court to 20 from 10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is 50.50, and in circuit court 108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said.

The key components of the premise are: - The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) - Increased interest within the executive branch and Congress - Linking performance and results to resource allocation and other decisions Step 2: Assess if the premise provides the necessary information to support the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"The Congress has enough evidence to conclude this.\\" Step 3: Evaluate the connection between the premise and the hypothesis. It's clear that there is a connection between the premise and the hypothesis, as the premise mentions that there has been an increasing interest within the executive branch and Congress in linking performance and results to resource allocation and other decisions, which can be a result of the GPRA. However, the premise doesn't provide specific evidence (e.g., quantitative data, case studies, etc.) to support the hypothesis that Congress has enough evidence to conclude this. The premise only establishes a trend in executive branch and congressional interest but does not quantify or describe the evidence. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis can be concluded as true based on the given premise.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"John eats so much.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"Yes, a linguist would likely rate \\"John eats so much\\" as an acceptable sentence linguistically. To understand why, let us break down the elements of the sentence and analyze its grammatical structure. 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence is \\"John,\\" which is a proper noun representing a person. In English grammar, proper nouns function well as subjects because they identify a specific entity performing an action or existing in a state. 2. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"eats,\\" which is an action verb in the simple present tense. This verb effectively illustrates an action or repeated habit. Also, the verb form \\"eats\\" agrees with the singular subject \\"John\\" in terms of subject-verb agreement, which is essential for constructing a grammatically correct sentence. 3. Adverb: The adverb \\"so\\" is used in this sentence to emphasize the extent or degree of the action taking place. In this context, it serves to intensify the meaning by indicating that John eats a significant amount. 4. Object: Lastly, the object in this sentence is the noun phrase \\"much,\\" which functions as the direct object of the verb \\"eats,\\" and it is in itself further modified by the adverb \\"so.\\" In this context, \\"much\\" refers to the unspecified quantity of food that John consumes, and by using \\"much\\" as the object, the sentence focuses on the overall amount rather than a specific kind of food. Taking these factors into account, this sentence adheres to the basic rules of English grammar, with the correct usage of nouns, verbs, adverbs, and object forms. The sentence has a clear subject (\\"John\\"), an action verb that agrees with the subject (\\"eats\\"), and an adverb to emphasize the extent of the action (\\"so much\\"). Consequently, the sentence conveys a clear meaning and is likely to be considered acceptable by a linguist in terms of linguistic principles. It is worth noting that language is dynamic, and the acceptability of a sentence might depend on the context and audience. However, considering the sentence structure and proper grammar usage in \\"John eats so much,\\" it is safe to say that it would generally be considered linguistically acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Bachelorette's JoJo Fletcher on Her Rose Ceremony Walkout: It Was a 'Moment of Overwhelming Anxiety' Staying in true South American fashion ... Hola mi amigos! On that note, let me just begin by saying how truly BEAUTIFUL Buenos Aires was. Hands down my favorite location in South America. And it didn't hurt to have eight incredible men with me. My first one-on-one date was with Wells and I was really looking forward to spending more time with him. Leading up to this date, the big elephant in the room was the fact that Wells and I hadn't actually kissed yet. A part of me appreciated his approach to really getting to know me rather than leading with a physical connection, but on the other hand, I felt as though we were running out of time to fully develop our relationship. Either way, Wells intrigued me and I really wanted to explore that more. Walking into the guys' hotel to pick up Wells, I could sense something was a little off. Wasn't too sure what it was, but Luke dropped the big bomb as we were leaving when he said \\"Are you guys going to kiss today?!\\" Talk about A-W-K-W-A-R-D. We couldn't get out of that room fast enough! I thought it would be a fun date to take Wells to the well-known show Fuerza Bruta – and as you all saw, it was quite the production. But the entire time, all I could think about was the kiss. To rework a little Shakespeare, \\"to kiss or not to kiss, that is the question.\\" Rolling around, half-clothed, in a dimly lit suspended pool surely this was the moment. Drumroll ... IT HAPPENED!!! The long awaited kiss that we both had been waiting for. (P.S. Im pretty sure I made the first move!). It was nice and sweet and it finally gave me an idea of what Wells and I could be like in a more romantic relationship. As much as that kiss helped moved things forward with Wells, I was still a little unsure of where our relationship stood. I knew that evening could and would be very telling. During dinner, we had a chance to talk about his past relationship. Hearing Wells tell me that his last relationship ended because they were more best friends rather than lovers, really struck me. This was the moment I knew that Wells and my relationship would never go beyond being just friends and that I had to tell him that. Saying goodbye to Wells was heartbreaking. It even made me sad just watching it back and seeing his optimism for what our relationship could have been. I really hope he finds that fairytale love that he deserves! After a hard goodbye, I was looking forward to my group date. And what better way to experience Buenos Aires than with a group of great guys in the La Boca District? We shopped, we danced, and we somehow ended up in a pick-up game of soccer. Now this is where it gets fun! Playing this pick-up game was a blast, but I was exhausted! One thing I did learn during this date was that Robby may not be the best soccer player, but he sure is a smart businessman. Or maybe not! Sorry that goalie stole your money, Robby! After getting our workout in for the day, it was time to enjoy a little cocktail hour with these great men. Let me just preface these next few sentences with: I'm sorry Dad. The PASSION between Luke and I ... I mean, I'm sure you all could feel that through your TV. It was HOTT. Period. Ok lets all try to settle back down and move on. James. I adore James! Watching this all back made me so emotional because I never knew James struggled with his confidence being around the other guys. I wish he could see himself through my eyes. During my one-on-one time with James, he brought up some issues with Jordan. Looking back, I wonder if that was guided solely by fact or was this possibly his insecurities acting out? Either way, I needed to address the situation with Jordan. This wasn't the first tough conversation I'd had with Jordan. My feelings for Jordan were really starting to grow, however I had my reservations. After talking through the scenario (which by the way was about a silly poker game ... men!), Jordan reassured me of his intentions yet again, and how the scenario played out. I felt a little bad spending so much of my time with Jordan talking about these things, but I also knew what I needed to do in order to understand the entirety of the situation and make the right decisions moving forward. Overall, that night was great. Sure, there were some tough convos, but I started to realize that this was becoming very real for all of us. One thing that I have learned throughout my experience on this journey is that you have to trust your gut and live in the moment. That night, my time with Luke exceeded anything I could have imagined. I wanted to make sure he knew that by giving him the rose. And now for the most DRAMATIC moment of the episode: the dreaded SECOND two-on-one. Now, I know you all are probably very confused why I asked to let me do this, and especially with Chase and Derek, two guys I clearly had strong connections with. But that was the problem. My relationship with each had stalled a little, and I knew if I was ever going to come out of this happily in love, I needed to start forcing myself to make tough decisions about which relationships I wanted to move forward. Derek had been more open and upfront with his feelings, but I had started to feel like our relationship was falling behind. With Chase on the other hand, we had a very strong connection yet he struggled with letting his guard down and it made me question his feelings towards me. I needed that two-on-one date to figure out who I saw a who I really could see a future with, and at the end of the day, I knew in my gut that I could see it with Chase but not with Derek. I knew giving that rose to Chase was the right choice, but it killed me to have to do it front of Derek. That was not easy because Derek truly is such a good guy. Going back to see Chase was the only thing that made me feel better. Getting to be in his arms while listening to Soledad Pastorutti sing was a bittersweet moment. After a week full of eventful dates, it was now time for the Rose Ceremony. What you guys didn't get to see in the episode is that just seconds before entering the foyer to meet the guys, I had this moment of overwhelming nerves and anxiety. Something just came over me and I had to stop for almost half an hour just to gather my thoughts. Sorry for making you wait, guys! But this only foreshadowed my emotions to come. You could tell I wasn't the only one feeling anxious. In every conversation I had that night, the men were making it clear more than ever of how they felt about me and I could sense at this point, it was do or die for them. Even though my conversations were so honest and open with all of the men, at the end of the cocktail party I still was so confused. I was banking on my gut kicking in to make a last minute decision, but standing there with one rose left and James and Alex before me, I just panicked. When it comes to finding a soul mate, you can't make an impulsive decision. I knew I needed more time. Thankfully Chris Harrison came in to save the day yet again. (I know Chris, I should start paying you for therapy sessions at this point.) Anyways, being able to keep all of my guys was such a relief! However, I knew on some level that this only meant that next week would be harder. There are goodbyes to come that are so heartbreaking and tearful and emotional that it pains me just to think about them now. But you should see them. Stay tuned. airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who decided to devote themselves to portrait painting in 1856? George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

In a New Hampshire town hall hosted by the Today show, the Republican candidate for president talked about his start in the real estate business that has made him a billionaire. “It’s not been easy for me,” Trump said. “I started off in Brooklyn, my father gave me a small loan of 1 million. I came into Manhattan. I had to pay him back. I had to pay him back with interest. But I came into Manhattan, I started buying up properties. I did great.” Eventually Today show host Matt Lauer interrupted to say what most of America was thinking. “By the way, let’s just put this in perspective. You said that it hasn’t been easy for you, but my dad gave me a million dollar loan. That is probably going to seem pretty easy to a lot of people,” Lauer said. Trump said, “You’re right. But a million dollars isn’t very much compared to what I built.” ||||| In a town-hall style interview with Matt Lauer on \\"Today\\" Monday morning, GOP hopeful Donald Trump insisted that he can relate to \\"the average American,\\" saying that like them, he has eaten at McDonald's and driven himself in a car -- and received a \\"small loan\\" of 1 million from his father to get his first business up and running. \\"My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars,\\" Trump said, as people in the audience gasped audibly and asked, \\"Small loan?\\" Trump insisted that the money allowed him entry into the Manhattan real estate market, and that his father made him pay the loan back with interest, but the damage was already done, as even other Today show hosts found that statement absurd: I predict we'll be hearing more about that \\"million dollar loan\\" from his father Trump mentioned during the @TODAYshow town hall — Savannah Guthrie (@SavannahGuthrie) October 26, 2015 But they weren't the only ones: And a small loan is like 100, not no 1,000,000.

Trump: My dad gave me a 'small loan' of a million dollars As Donald Trump tells it, he has been told no his entire life. For example, he said Monday, his father gave him a \\"small loan of a million dollars\\" that he had to repay with interest at the start of his career. “Oh many times. I’ve been told no by him.

But I came into Manhattan and I started buying properties, and I did great.\\" Trump said his father had told him that going to Manhattan would not work, and later in his life, other people told him that a presidential campaign would not pan out. NBC's Matt Lauer followed up on Trump's \\"small loan\\" remark: \\"By the way, let's just put this in perspective, you said it hasn't been easy for you, but my dad gave me a million-dollar loan.

Trump mentioned that his father gave him a \\"small loan of 1 million\\" to begin his career in Manhattan. The comment sparked reactions from the audience at the town hall, as well as from people on social media, who felt that a 1 million loan was not a small amount, especially when compared to the financial struggles faced by average Americans. When confronted by host Matt Lauer about the public's perception of the loan, Trump conceded that it might seem easy to many people. However, he insisted that a million dollars was not much compared to the empire he eventually built. Trump's statement about his \\"small loan\\" highlights the disparities between billionaires and the average worker. For many people, a million-dollar loan is an unimaginable amount of money and an opportunity one can only dream of. However, for Trump, it was merely a starting point for his investments in Manhattan real estate. As the story gained attention, both Trump's supporters and his critics weighed in with their opinions. Some supporters felt the comment showcased Trump's business acumen and demonstrated that the loan was a justifiable investment. On the other hand, critics argued that the comment was tone-deaf and showed Trump's inability to relate to the financial struggles of common people. Overall, the conversation around Trump's \\"small loan\\" of a million dollars demonstrates the stark contrasts in wealth and opportunities available to different individuals. While Trump was able to use the loan to build an empire, many Americans continue to struggle with financial stability, highlighting the need for policies that address income inequality and provide opportunities for upward mobility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run. After another Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots moved into Jaguars territory on a 29-yard Welker catch and later extended their lead to 28-0 on a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss. This would remain the score after the Jaguars ended the half on another punt. The Jaguars began the second half with a 16-play, 69-yard drive that took over eight minutes off the clock; however, it ended without any points after Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line on a 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive of their own, despite a false start penalty to begin it. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady hit Moss on his third touchdown catch of the game, putting the Patriots ahead 35-0. However, the Jaguars responded quickly, moving past midfield on a 22-yard Rashad Jennings run and into the red zone on a 20-yard Nate Hughes reception. Two plays later, Garrard scrambled two yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 35-7. With 12:41 remaining in the game, the Patriots received the ball after the kickoff. What ensued was a 20-play drive, with the Patriots reaching midfield with about ten minutes remaining in the game, and reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. The drive included five first downs, including two off fourth down conversions. One play after the two-minute warning, Hoyer replaced Brady at quarterback, and one play later, the Patriots turned the ball over on downs after a failed 4th-and-2 run by Morris. The Jaguars, with 29 seconds left in the game, ran one play to end the game.

Information: - Ben Chasny is an indie rock and psychedelic folk guitarist. His primary projects are Six Organs of Admittance (his solo psych folk project) and Comets on Fire (a psychedelic rock band). He made his recording debut in 1996 with his heavy, free rock project Plague Lounge on \\"The Wicker Image\\", an LP released conjointly between the New World of Sound and Holy Mountain labels. Holy Mountain went on to become the \\"home\\" of many of his releases under the Six Organs Of Admittance moniker. He has also released an album with Hiroyuki Usui under the name August Born. Chasny has lent his talents to other projects such as Badgerlore, Double Leopards, Current 93 and Magik Markers both in live performance and studio albums. More recent musical projects of his include the avant-folk trio Rangda (along with guitarist Richard Bishop and drummer Chris Corsano) and the more melodic and conventional 200 Years with Magik Markers' Elisa Ambrogio. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Six Organs of Admittance is the primary musical project of guitarist Ben Chasny. Chasny's music is largely guitar-based and is often considered new folk; however, it includes obvious influences, marked by the use of drones, chimes, and eclectic percussive elements. He records albums for Drag City and Holy Mountain, among other labels. - School of the Flower is the eighth album by experimental indie rock band, Six Organs of Admittance, released in 2005. - Shelter from the Ash is the tenth album by experimental indie rock band , Six Organs of Admittance , released on November 20 , 2007 .

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Just-married taxi driver Thomas Leslie 'Tom' Manning is led to an abandoned bomb-site by an eight-year-old girl who says that she has lost her dog. The kind-hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief to dry her tears. She then runs off taunting Manning as an April-fool prank. He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz. A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case. She later wins the sympathy of the junior counsel Peter Tanner, who visits Manning in prison, believes in his protestation of innocence and makes the case his own. The trial begins at London's Old Bailey, where Tanner is opposed by his father, prosecuting counsel Geoffrey Tanner. The trial is presided over by Justice Harrington, whose wife is in the hospital undergoing a serious operation. It soon becomes evident that things are going badly for Manning. Jurors are seen expressing their belief in Manning's guilt even before the trial was over. Irene's mother gave hearsay evidence that Manning had given the victim sweets, breaking down in tears and accusing Manning of murder. Following the testimony of prosecution-witness Horace Clifford, all of the evidence seems to point to Manning's guilt. answer the following question: What is the full name of the prosecuting counsel's son?

Context: We all present these glossy lives to the world; coffee cups presented to dewy sunrises, champagne in airport lounges, luxurious restaurants that cost more than they should and share the blue skies days of exploration. I’m as guilty as anyone. But, what about behind those scenes? Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’. So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera. This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am. I lovingly wrapped my camera in a soft scarf every day for 3 weeks, growled under my breath at anyone who looked like they might jostle me and at one point found...

The calls came after a study revealed a sharp rise in the number of EU migrants without a job living in Britain to more than 600,000 – the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow. There was a 73 per cent increase in the number of ‘job-seeking’ EU immigrants in the country in the three years to 2011, according to the European Commission. £2bn: Potential cost of","completion":"providing benefits to unemployed EU migrants in the UK per year by 2025 if action is not taken This issue has sparked intense debate among politicians and the public as to the best course of action in addressing the situation. Critics argue that the current system is unfairly burdening British taxpayers and that more effort should be put into ensuring that those coming to the UK are here to work or have the financial means to support themselves. In response to these concerns, the Prime Minister has been urged to consider implementing a series of policy changes, aimed at curbing the influx of unemployed EU migrants and reducing the strain on the country's welfare budget. These proposals include restricting access to benefits for new arrivals, as well as imposing time limits on welfare payments for those unable to find work within a certain period. Spearheaded by members of David Cameron's own Conservative Party, the proposed measures are gaining the support of a growing number of MPs who argue for urgent action, particularly in light of the looming Brexit deadline and the uncertainty faced by both British citizens and EU migrants residing in the UK. To detractors, the proposed policy changes appear to disproportionately target and discriminate against EU citizens who wish to live and work in Britain. They warn that such actions may strain already tense UK-EU relations at a critical time during the Brexit negotiations. If enacted, the reform measures could lead to a substantial decrease in the number of job-seeking EU immigrants, potentially easing the burden on the UK's welfare budget and recouping some of the £2 billion in savings by 2025. However, these savings would need to be balanced against the potential economic impact of reducing the pool of potential workers for UK businesses, as well as the potential backlash from EU countries who see this move as an affront to their citizens' rights. Ultimately, the Prime Minister's course of action may depend on a delicate balancing act. He must weigh the economic benefits of reducing welfare expenditure against the potential damage to international relationships, UK businesses, and individual rights. Whichever path he chooses, David Cameron will need to negotiate skillfully with both domestic political allies and European counterparts to ensure a smooth and effective implementation of any changes to the UK's immigration and benefits policies. The outcome of these negotiations and the resulting policy changes will have a significant impact on the future of the UK's welfare system, the EU-British relationship, and the lives of the 600,000-plus EU migrants currently residing in the country. The stakes are high, and the nation's eyes are firmly trained on the Prime Minister as he faces the challenge of guiding Britain through this complex and contentious policy debate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Three possessions later, Akiem Hicks returned a Marcus Mariota fumble 14 yards for a touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 14-0. After another Titans punt, Amendola fumbled with Cody Riggs recovering at the Patriots 26. The Titans could only reach the Patriots 21, but Ryan Succop got the Titans on the board with a 49-yard field goal. Keshawn Martin returned the ensuing kick 75 yards to the Titans 30. Two plays later, Brady hit White for a 30-yard touchdown, widening the lead to 21-3. Zach Mettenberger replaced Mariota on the next drive, and the Titans drove to the Patriots 38, but on 4th-and-1, Antonio Andrews stuffed for no gain. The Patriots drove to the Titans 25 and Gostkowski increased the lead to 24-3 on a 43-yard field goal. Amendola returned the ensuing punt 22 yards to the Patriots 45. The Patriots drove to the Titans 30, but Gostkowski missed the 48-yard field goal wide right, keeping the score 24-3 at halftime. After the Patriots punted, aid by an 18-yard punt return by Harry Douglas, the Titans drove 59 yards in 7 plays, with Mettenberger finding Delanie Walker for a 7-yard touchdown, trimming the deficit to 24-10. The Patriots responded by driving to the Titans 20, and Gostkowski was good from 38 yards away. Three possessions later, the Titans reached the Patriots 36, but Mettenberger was intercepted by Butler at the 2. After a Patriots three-and-out, Mettenberger hit Walker again for a 57-yard touchdown pass, with a missed extra point, making the score just 27-16. The Patriots drove to the Titans 23, and Gostkowski upped the score to 30-16 with his 41-yard field goal. The Titans drove to the Patriots 48, but Mettenberger was intercepted by Collins who returned it 51 yards to the Titans 16. Four plays later, Gostkowski hit a 32-yarder, making the score 33-16. The Titans ran out the rest of the clock to end the game. With the win, the Patriots improved to 12-2, and they clinched a first-round bye following the Broncos' loss to the Steelers later that night. How many total yards did Gostkowski attempt to kick for field goals in the first half?","completion":"To find out how many total yards Stephen Gostkowski attempted to kick for field goals in the first half, we need to look at the field goals he attempted before halftime. The first Gostkowski field goal mentioned was for 43 yards. The second field goal he attempted was from 48 yards out, but he missed. By adding these two attempts together, we get the total yards Gostkowski attempted in the first half. 43 yards + 48 yards = 91 yards So, Gostkowski attempted to kick for a total of 91 yards in field goals in the first half."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Title: Ingredient amounts are fine Product review: This is a delightful looseleaf notebook full of recipes to be packed in a jar. It's important to use the wide mouth jar as this allows some extra room for packing. Narrow mouth jars don't work. On some of the recipes, the ingredient amounts add up to 5+ cups, but, because they are packed, they fit snuggly in the jar. You don't want the ingredients to lose their layered look, so it is important to pack them down. These recipes are nice and trustworthy. The looseleaf element allows for adding/ removing pages.

This is quite an unusual and unique little western, that is made mostly original due to its story that revolves around an unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all of those who get to poses it at one point or another in the movie. It's mostly a very entertaining movie to watch but not without still being a real western as well. The movie got done in a typical '40's/'50's style of western genre film-making, so the lovers of the genre should not be turned off by its somewhat unusual main premise. Because the rifle is actually being the main plot device of the movie, it allows the story to follow multiple characters throughout the movie, who are all connected of course and the story makes full circle in the end. Without that this movie would had been a pretty messy one to watch, since the story often jumps from the one hazardous occasion into the other, with constantly different characters involved. Quite amazing how they even managed to put Wyatt Earp in this all. But it's no criticism really. I liked that the movie and its story were being original and how the movie seemed to move from the one event to the other. It gave the movie a bit of a sense of adventure and entertainment. It's also a really great looking movie. I liked the settings the movie used and it seems quite amazing that this was actually the director Anthony Mann's first western. Luckily he would go on to direct more westerns later on, which also often would star James Stewart in the main lead. It was a pretty daring casting choice to pick James Stewart as the main lead. He is one of the softest and most polite looking and acting actors, so casting him as a tough gunslinger seems like a bit of an odd pick. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and it shows how versatile and really capable as an actor he actually was. It also has some other surprising actors in the movie, that are not often get connected with this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female lead and also later well known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in some small roles. A real western with also plenty of action and entertainment to it. 8/10 Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

Can we infer the following? The 1982 football game was held in September.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that the 1982 Nebraska vs. Penn State football game was held in September, specifically on September 25, 1982. The game took place during the 1982 NCAA Division I-A football season at Beaver Stadium in State College, Pennsylvania. The two teams that competed were the then-#2 Nebraska Cornhuskers, coached by Tom Osborne, and the then-#8 Penn State Nittany Lions, coached by Joe Paterno. The 1982 football season was significant for both teams. Nebraska was a powerhouse that entered the game with a 3-0 record and the status of being ranked second in the nation. Penn State, on the other hand, was also a strong team and was ranked eighth at the time of the game. As a high-profile contest between two nationally ranked teams, this game attracted a considerable amount of attention from college football fans and media. Beaver Stadium, the venue for the game, is Penn State's home field and has a rich history as one of the most iconic stadiums in college football. Opened in 1960, the stadium originally seated around 46,000 spectators, but has since been expanded multiple times to reach its current capacity of over 106,000. The game between Nebraska and Penn State in 1982 was played in front of a raucous crowd and served as an important contest for both teams as they continued their respective quests for success in the 1982 season. The matchup between Tom Osborne and Joe Paterno, both of whom are legendary coaches with impressive career records, added another layer of intrigue to the game. Osborne, who served as Nebraska's head coach from 1973 to 1997, is best known for winning three national championships (1994, 1995, and 1997) and having an overall career winning percentage of .836. Paterno, the longtime head coach at Penn State from 1966 to 2011, earned two national championships (1982 and 1986) and built a coaching legacy that included a record 409 victories. The game itself was a closely contested battle that ultimately saw Penn State emerge as the victor by a score of 27-24. The result was a key moment for Joe Paterno's team, as they would go on to have an undefeated season and capture the 1982 National Championship by defeating the University of Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. Meanwhile, the Nebraska Huskers would finish the season with a record of 12-1, their only loss being the setback against Penn State. In conclusion, the 1982 Nebraska vs. Penn State football game took place on September 25, 1982, during the 1982 NCAA Division I-A football season. The game, held at Beaver Stadium in State College, Pennsylvania, featured a high-stakes contest between two nationally ranked teams led by legendary coaches Tom Osborne and Joe Paterno. The game served as a significant point in both programs' seasons, with Penn State defeating Nebraska and ultimately winning the National Championship, while the Cornhuskers finished with an impressive 12-1 record."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, written in the early 14th century, merged a medieval world view with classical ideals. Another promoter of the Italian language was Boccaccio with his Decameron. The application of the vernacular did not entail a rejection of Latin, and both Dante and Boccaccio wrote prolifically in Latin as well as Italian, as would Petrarch later (whose Canzoniere also promoted the vernacular and whose contents are considered the first modern lyric poems).

Options: - airport - heaven - detroit - flight school - airplane The answer is \\"detroit\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"Detroit\\" because it involves a symbolic representation rather than a literal association with wings. The presence of wings on a helmet is likely connected to the symbol of \\"The Detroit Red Wings,\\" a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit, Michigan. While the other options such as airport, heaven, flight school, and airplane depict places or concepts closely related to air and flight in a more literal sense, they are not directly connected to the presence of wings on a helmet. In these options, wings are associated with flying objects or locations where flying occurs. The connection here might be relatively apparent, but it lacks the strong symbolism present in the other option. The Detroit Red Wings are one of the most iconic and successful teams in the National Hockey League (NHL) and have a large fan base. Their logo features a winged wheel to represent Detroit's strong ties to the automotive industry and the speed associated with hockey. Fans and players of the Detroit Red Wings often demonstrate their support for the team by wearing merchandise or apparel adorned with the team's logo. Therefore, the image of wings on a helmet would likely be recognized as a symbol of support for the Detroit Red Wings, making \\"Detroit\\" the most accurate answer.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Today it is found that school students hardly pay much attention to sports.It is because they have no interest in sports? It may not be the fact.They often say they have other more important things to do. What are these important things? Examination! They have to spend much time on all kinds of examinations and tests at school,so many of them almost become bookworm .In the summer holidays of the last year,they had to put all the time to their study.So books stopped them from enjoying sports. Because of the pressure from their parents and teachers,they have to work harder and spend most of their time on books.As for the students themselves,they want to get good results so that they can go to famous high schools.So it seems necessary to stop their school sports for saving more time to study.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Teen Beach Movie\\" introduces confident McKenzie \\"Mack\\" (Maia Mitchell) and her carefree boyfriend Brady (Ross Lynch), a fan of the retro surf musical movie, \\"West Side Story.\\" On the morning of Mack's scheduled departure for boarding school, she and Brady catch one last epic wave which mysteriously carries them right into \\"West Side Story,\\" circa 1962, where they meet Seacat (Jordan Fisher), Giggles (Mollee Gray), Rascal (Kent Boyd) and Cheechee (Chrissie Fit), among others. Amidst the spontaneous song and dance, there's trouble in paradise -- it's bikers versus surfers for control of the local hangout, but Mack and Brady unwittingly interfere with the movie's star-crossed plot, one that would pair a surfer, the teen matinee idol Tanner (Garrett Clayton), and a biker, Lela (Grace Phipps), the sister of Butchy (John DeLuca), the biker gang (The Rodents') leader.

In German, it's translated as \\"diese.\\" - didactical games: \\"didaktischen Spiele\\" - The term \\"didactical games\\" refers to educational or teaching games developed to help students learn. In German, it's known as \\"didaktische Spiele,\\" where the adjective \\"didaktisch\\" describes the nature of the games and \\"Spiele\\" refers to the games themselves. However, since \\"diese\\" is in its plural form here, the adjective \\"didaktisch\\" must also be changed to its plural form \\"didaktischen.\\" - address: \\"richten sich an\\" - \\"Address\\" in this context means to target or be directed at a specific audience, i.e., primary and secondary students in this example. In German, this concept is expressed with the phrase \\"richten sich an.\\" - primary students: \\"Grundschüler\\" - The term \\"primary students\\" refers to students in primary or elementary school.

None of us bought anything, and we talked for hours.","completion":"As we sat in the dimly lit corner of the bar, the old jukebox in the background played some of our favorite tunes. The clinking of glasses and soft murmurs of conversation filled the air while we occupied the worn, vintage leather booth. We exchanged stories, taking turns reminiscing about old memories – high school shenanigans, past relationships, and ridiculous family gatherings. Each story was filled with laughter, as we repeated some of our most outrageous experiences together. We had truly seen it all during the years of our friendship. At one point, we started discussing our current financial situation - college debts, living expenses, and the challenges of finding stable, well-paying jobs. Being all broke, we realized that we had unconsciously formed a support group for one another – our friendship stood tall on the foundations of understanding, compassion, and solidarity. There was a lull in the conversation when the jukebox began playing a song we hadn't heard in years. It was an old track from our high school days, and we couldn't help but burst into song, belting our hearts out regardless of our terribly off-key voices. As the song ended, we laughed until tears streamed down our faces, taking a moment to catch our breath. The bar was getting crowded as time passed and soon, a group of people challenged us to a game of pool. We looked at each other and collectively shrugged. Why not? We had nothing to lose – no money on the line, just a game between new acquaintances. As we grabbed the cues and arranged the balls on the pool table, an unexpected but welcome sense of excitement crept in. We took turns hitting the balls, sharing stories and jokes with the people around us. Surprisingly, our group held its own and emerged as the victors of the night. High-fives, congratulatory pats on the back, and good-natured banter was exchanged. Throughout the night, we forged connections with fellow patrons – a group of tourists passing through town, a couple of regulars, and even the bartender, Jack, who seemed to have an endless supply of anecdotes. As we had no money to buy anything, Jack generously offered us a round of inexpensive, house-blend drinks. We raised our glasses in a toast to newfound friendships and the power of camaraderie. Throughout our lives, we had all faced considerable ups and downs, but being in that bar with my closest friends, we all knew that these seemingly insignificant moments were the ones that we would treasure most. In a world where money often dictated our experiences, we discovered that some of the best memories could be made without spending a dime, as long as we were surrounded by the people we loved. As the clock struck midnight, we bid farewell to Jack and our new-found friends, and made our way to the door. In high spirits, we walked out into the cool night air, reminiscing over what a magical night it had been. We strolled down the sidewalk, arms linked, our hearts full of appreciation and gratitude for one another. Looking up at the sky dotted with twinkling stars, we were reminded that even amidst the struggles of adulthood, true friendships often required little more than sincerity, understanding, and unconditional love. And as we walked into the embrace of the night, it was this revelation that left a mark on all our hearts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The population had declined to 140 by 1966 due to a decline in fish stocks and the community was depopulated in 1967 . - The Burin Peninsula is a peninsula located on the south coast of the island of Newfoundland in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. - Placentia Bay is a body of water on the southeast coast of Newfoundland, Canada. It is formed by Burin Peninsula on the west and Avalon Peninsula on the east. Fishing grounds in the bay were used by native people long before the first European fishermen arrived in the 16th century. For a time, the French controlled the bay. They built their capital at Placentia on the east coast. The British gained Placentia during the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The town and nearby Castle Hill are national historic sites. English settlement followed in the bay and today the main communities are Burin, Marystown, and Placentia. - The Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties, rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war. - The Avalon Peninsula is a large peninsula (9,220 km²) that makes up the southeast portion of the island of Newfoundland. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America.

Ken is a scientist who studies atomic systems. He is currently responsible for studying two systems that they are referring to as Omega and Alpha. These two systems are essential to the research that is being done to potentially allow humans to travel to Mars in a reasonable amount of time. Little is known about these systems currently, but scientists have observed that Omega has been steadily gaining more potential energy. Alpha has been rapidly losing potential energy. Ken is hoping to discern why this is happening and try to utilize his findings to further space exploration. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which system is less stable? Hint: As the atoms first begin to interact, the attractive force is stronger than the repulsive force and so the potential energy of the system decreases, as seen in the diagram. Remember that the lower potential energy increases the stability of the system. As the two hydrogen atoms move closer and closer together, the potential energy continues to decrease. Eventually, a position is reached where the potential energy is at its lowest possible point. If the hydrogen atoms move any closer together, a third interaction begins to dominate and that is the repulsive force between the two positively-charged nuclei. This repulsive force is very strong as can be seen by the sharp rise in energy at the far left of the diagram.","completion":"Based on the information given and the hint provided, we can determine the stability of the systems by looking at their potential energy. From the hint, we know that lower potential energy increases the stability of a system. Omega has been observed to be steadily gaining more potential energy, while Alpha has been rapidly losing potential energy. Since lower potential energy correlates to higher stability, we can infer that the system with decreasing potential energy (Alpha) is more stable than the system with increasing potential energy (Omega). Therefore, the less stable system is Omega."},{"prompt":"You are given a new situation: Two groups of students went on a field trip.

The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\". Q: So some background information my friend ( I'll call him GB) broke up with his girlfriend (HR) and we still have the same friend group so you could see how this could be a problem. HR and I have always been kinda close even when they were dating we were all best friends. At the time i kinda had romantic feelings for her but they weren't strong enough for me to like do anything about it and since they were dating i was like duh no chance but i was fine with that because I was doing my own thing and exploring myself I wasn't in a state to have a relationship at that time but do keep in mind I was not the reason they broke up. But Now things have changed 3 weeks ago I started talking HR and she told me that she and GB broke up because reasons. I didn't know that at the time everyone was kept in the dark about it. So I felt like wow I waited awhile to ask her out and when I did she said um yes of course. Now I told some people in our friend group and was met with immediate backlash with them saying how awful I am, that I shouldn't be doing this, and how that I'm only doing it to cause drama which is not the case. So right now I'm at a loss my reasoning is that relationships are about trial and error and thar if it didn't work out then respect each other and move on and not take any hostility towards their new S/O but apparently not and now I'm doubting myself So WIBTA if I started to date her A:","completion":"Task Explanation: The task requires evaluating the ethical behavior of the author of the anecdote, who begins dating his friend's ex-girlfriend (HR) after their break-up. The author should be judged as \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\" based on the given information. Fact Analysis: 1. The author's friend (GB) and his girlfriend (HR) broke up recently. 2. The author has always been close to HR and had some romantic feelings for her. 3. The author was not the reason for their break-up. 4. After learning about the break-up, the author waits and eventually asks HR out, getting her consent. 5. The author informs the friend group and gets criticized for his actions. Conclusion: Since the author was not the cause of GB and HR's break-up, he waited for some time after the split and asked HR out, taking her feelings into account. Moreover, HR agreed to date the author. Based on these points, the author's behavior can be considered as ethically acceptable. Answer: RIGHT"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's my analysis of both sentences and their similarities and differences: 1. Yemen suicide bombing kills soldiers: - The event takes place in Yemen. - The type of attack is a suicide bombing. - The targets are soldiers. - The gender of the attacker is unspecified. 2. Female suicide bomber kills 16 at Russian station: - The event takes place at a Russian station. - The type of attack is also a suicide bombing. - 16 people are killed, but their specific identity (civilians, soldiers, etc.) is not mentioned. - The attacker is a female suicide bomber. Looking at both sentences, there are several similarities and differences. The most obvious similarity is the type of attack, which is a suicide bombing in both cases. However, the locations and targets of the attacks differ. The first sentence describes an attack in Yemen, targeting soldiers, while the second sentence describes an attack at a Russian station, with no information about the target demographic or occupation of the victims. The second sentence also mentions that the attacker is a female, while the first does not provide the gender of the attacker. In summary, despite sharing the theme of a suicide bombing, the differences in location, targets, and the attacker's gender show that there is some variation between the two sentences. Hence, I would give a similarity rating of 3. This suggests that these sentences share certain similarities but have noticeable differences as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"The French flag includes red because it is what?\\" Context: \\"Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags. The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of Christ's blood (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white, and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes \\"Tomistoma\\", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes \\"Tomistoma\\", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha. - Rhynchosaurs were a group of Triassic diapsid reptiles related to the archosaurs . - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included).

Please write a short summary for the following article: Peter Matthiessen, Lyrical Writer and Naturalist, Is Dead at 86 Peter Matthiessen, a roving author and naturalist whose impassioned nonfiction explored the remote endangered wilds of the world and whose prizewinning fiction often placed his mysterious protagonists in the heart of them, died on Saturday at his home in Sagaponack, N.Y. He was 86. His son Alex said the cause was leukemia, which was diagnosed more than a year ago. Mr. Matthiessen’s final novel, “In Paradise,” is to be published on Tuesday by Riverhead Books. Mr. Matthiessen was one of the last survivors of a generation of American writers who came of age after World War II and who all seemed to know one another, socializing in New York and on Long Island’s East End as a kind of movable literary salon peopled by the likes of William Styron, James Jones, Kurt Vonnegut and E. L. Doctorow. In the early 1950s, he shared a sojourn in Paris with fellow literary expatriates and helped found The Paris Review, a magazine devoted largely to new fiction and poetry. His childhood friend George Plimpton became its editor. A rugged, weather-beaten figure who was reared and educated in privilege — an advantage that left him uneasy, he said — Mr. Matthiessen was a man of many parts: littérateur, journalist, environmentalist, explorer, Zen Buddhist, professional fisherman and, in the early 1950s, undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency in Paris. Only years later did Mr. Plimpton discover, to his anger and dismay, that Mr. Matthiessen had helped found The Review as a cover for his spying on Americans in France. Mr. Matthiessen’s travels took him to the wilds of Asia, Australia, South America, Africa, New Guinea, the Florida swamps and even beneath the ocean. They led to articles in The New Yorker and other magazines and a raft of nonfiction books, among them “The Snow Leopard” (1978), about a grief-stricken spiritual journey to the Himalayas, and “Men’s Lives” (1986), about Long Island fishermen and their vanishing way of life. The paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called Mr. Matthiessen “our greatest modern nature writer in the lyrical tradition.” Of his more than 30 books, nonfiction works far outnumbered the novels and short-story collections, but he considered fiction his first and highest calling. “Nonfiction at its best is like fashioning a cabinet,” he told The Paris Review in 1999. “It can never be sculpture. It can be elegant and very beautiful, but it can never be sculpture. Captive to facts — or predetermined forms — it cannot fly.” He holds the distinction of being the only writer to win the National Book Award in both fiction and nonfiction. And his fiction and nonfiction often arose from the same experience. His fourth novel, “At Play in the Fields of the Lord” (1965), grew out of his reporting for “The Cloud Forest: A Chronicle of the South American Wilderness” (1961). The novel, set in the Peruvian wilds, depicts the interaction between missionaries and tribesmen — at one point Mr. Matthiessen, an early user of LSD, has his protagonist drink a native hallucinogenic brew — and Western civilization’s damaging impact on primitive peoples. A film adaptation directed by Hector Babenco was released in 1991. Mr. Matthiessen’s fifth novel, “Far Tortuga” (1975), was inspired by a New Yorker assignment in which he reported on the vanishing Caribbean tradition of turtle hunting. Highly experimental — it drew on recordings of sometimes cryptic Caribbean dialogue — the novel drew mixed reviews. He delved into another isolated world for his late-career “Watson” trilogy — “Killing Mister Watson” (1990), “Lost Man’s River” (1997) and “Bone by Bone” (1999) — parts of which he compressed into one long opus, “Shadow Country” (2008). It won a National Book Award, though many critics thought a reworked version of previously published fiction did not deserve the honor. The trilogy uses the life and death of a fearsome historical figure, Edgar J. Watson, to address issues of race, environment and power in America. Watson, a mysterious cane planter in the Ten Thousand Islands region of southwest Florida, was suspected in dozens of murders, including that of the outlaw Belle Starr. Watson himself was killed in 1910 by residents of Chokoloskee, an island settlement where he was suspected in a string of deaths. “Perhaps the power of Matthiessen’s writing in part derives from his ability to tap into his dark side, his Jungian shadow,” a biographer, William Dowie, wrote. “If so, it would explain at least one similarity between him and the writers to whom he is sometimes compared in his major fiction: Melville, Conrad and Dostoyevsky.” Indeed, Mr. Matthiessen’s Watson carries an echo of Conrad’s Mr. Kurtz, the corrupted jungle lord in “Heart of Darkness.” “Even a quarter-mile away, out in the channel, the figure at the helm looked too familiar, the strong bulk of him, and the broad hat,” Mr. Matthiessen writes in the voice of a character named Mamie Smallwood. “When he saw the crowd, he tipped that hat and bowed a little, and the sun fired that dark red hair — color of dead blood, Grandma Ida used to say, only she never thunk that up till some years later, when the ones who never knew him called him Bloody Watson.” She goes on: “But it was that little bow he made that told us straight off who it was, and my heart jumped like a mullet, and it weren’t the only one. A hush and stillness fell on Chokoloskee, like our poor little community had caught its breath, like we was waiting for a storm to break from high dark thunderheads over the Glades in summer, just before the first cold wind and rain.” New York to the C.I.A. Peter Matthiessen was born on May 22, 1927, in Manhattan, a descendant of Scandinavian whale hunters and the second of three children of Erard A. Matthiessen, an architect and conservationist, and the former Elizabeth Carey. He grew up with his brother and sister on Fifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park (in the same building as Mr. Plimpton), and in country homes on Fishers Island, N.Y., and in Connecticut. He attended St. Bernard’s School in Manhattan (with George Plimpton) and, in Connecticut, Greenwich Country Day School and Hotchkiss, from which he graduated in 1945. He served in the Navy at Pearl Harbor and afterward attended Yale, where he majored in English but also studied biology, ornithology and zoology. He spent his junior year in Paris at the Sorbonne. He graduated from Yale in 1950 and stayed on for another term to teach creative writing. Encouraged by winning the prestigious Atlantic Prize for a story he had written as an undergraduate, Mr. Matthiessen found a literary agent, the steely Bernice Baumgarten, and sent her the first chapters of a novel. “I waited by the post office for praise to roll in, calls from Hollywood, everything,” he told The Missouri Review in 1989. “Finally my agent sent me a letter that said, ‘Dear Peter, James Fenimore Cooper wrote this 150 years ago, only he wrote it better. Yours, Bernice.’ I probably needed that; it was very healthy.” It was around this time that he was recruited by the C.I.A. and traveled to Paris, where he crossed paths with young expatriate American writers like Styron, Jones, James Baldwin and Irwin Shaw. In the postwar years the agency covertly financed magazines and cultural programs to counter the spread of Communism. In interviews years later, Mr. Matthiessen said that in those days working for the C.I.A. was seen by many of his peers as honorable government service and that it had offered him “a free trip to Paris to write my novel.” The novel was “Race Rock,” a tale of wealth and troubled young lives set in a New England fishing village. While working on it in Paris, he met another aspiring novelist, Harold L. Humes, known as Doc, and the two, along with others seeking an outlet for the work of emerging writers, founded The Paris Review in 1953. “I used The Paris Review as a cover, there’s no question of that,” he told The New York Times in 2008 after his C.I.A. connection had been discussed in “Doc,” a documentary film about Mr. Humes by his daughter Immy Humes. “But the C.I.A. had nothing to do with Paris Review.” That assertion was challenged in 2012 by an article in the online magazine Salon; drawing on The Review’s own archives, it suggested that there were C.I.A. ties that had bypassed Mr. Matthiessen or had outlived his two-year relationship with the agency. “I was getting information on people,” Mr. Matthiessen told Charlie Rose in a television interview in 2008. “I was a greenhorn.” He described the episode as “youthful folly.” Mr. Matthiessen had by then married Patsy Southgate, whom he had met at the Sorbonne when she was a Smith College student. “Race Rock” was published in 1954, after Mr. Matthiessen had returned to the United States and moved to the South Fork of Long Island, where his daughter, Sara, was born. The couple had already had a son, Lucas, in Paris in 1953. To put bread on the table, Mr. Matthiessen worked as a commercial fisherman and ran a deep-sea-fishing charter boat in the summer. He wrote during the winter and on days off. A second novel, “Partisans,” about a young man in Paris in search of a political hero, was published in 1955, and a third, “Raditzer,” about the son of a wealthy family going to sea to find himself, came out in 1960. By then he and his wife had divorced, and he had turned to nonfiction and had begun traveling widely, in one instance on assignment for Sports Illustrated to report on American endangered species. That led to the book “Wildlife in America” (1959), which gained the attention of William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker. Shawn signed him up to roam the world to write about its endangered wilds. His first assignment was a journey up the Amazon into Peru and south to Tierra del Fuego. It became the basis of “The Cloud Forest.” More explorations followed, leading to books that were often serialized in The New Yorker. A sample of his titles convey his geographic reach: “Under the Mountain Wall: A Chronicle of Two Seasons of Stone Age New Guinea” (1962); “Oomingmak: The Expedition to the Musk Ox Island in the Bering Sea” (1967); “The Shorebirds of North America” (1967, revised as “The Wind Birds” in 1973); “Blue Meridian: The Search for the Great White Shark” (1971); “The Tree Where Man Was Born” (1972), a contemplative account of East Africa; and “Sand Rivers” (1981), about a safari in the Selous Game Preserve in Tanzania. It was after his divorce, in 1958, that Mr. Matthiessen bought his oceanfront house, on six acres, in Sagaponack. In 1963, he married Deborah Love, a writer and poet, and the Sagaponack house became one of many gathering spots for his literary circle of East End neighbors and visitors. His wife had already embraced Zen Buddhism in the late 1960s when Mr. Matthiessen followed suit, meditating cross-legged for hours on end and later becoming a Zen priest. His spiritual hunger and the death of his wife from cancer in 1972 lay behind his decision to travel to Nepal in 1973. Ostensibly he went there to record a field trip with the biologist George Schaller. But the book it inspired, “The Snow Leopard,” also chronicled a spiritual journey and a pilgrimage of mourning shadowed by that rare animal, whose presence Mr. Matthiessen finally sensed even if he never actually caught sight of one. The book won the 1979 National Book Award for nonfiction. He also reached outside himself to understand the struggles of the oppressed and neglected, an effort he traced to a lifelong “uneasiness about unearned privilege.” (At 15, he had rebelliously had his name dropped from the Social Register.) Travels with Cesar Chavez, the champion of farm workers, led to the 1969 book “Sal Si Puedes (Escape if You Can): Cesar Chavez and the New American Revolution,” referring to the barrio in San Jose, Calif., where Mr. Chavez had gotten his start as a union organizer. Mr. Matthiessen went on to publish “In the Spirit of Crazy Horse” (1983), a fulmination against the federal government’s treatment of Native Americans, centering on the prosecution and conviction of Leonard Peltier in the murder of two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in 1975 at Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Mr. Matthiessen and the book’s publisher, Viking Press, were sued for libel damages in separate actions by an F.B.I. agent and a former South Dakota governor. Both suits were eventually dismissed, but at a cost to the defendants of more than 2 million in legal fees. In 1980 Mr. Matthiessen married Maria Eckhart, a former media buyer for an advertising firm in London who was born in Tanzania. In addition to his son Alex, from his marriage to Ms. Love, Mr. Matthiessen is survived by his son Lucas and a daughter Sara Carey Matthiessen, from his marriage to Ms. Southgate; a daughter Rue Matthiessen, from his marriage to Ms. Love; two stepdaughters, Antonia and Sarah Koenig; and six grandchildren. He continued to write books and articles into his later years in his roomy art-filled home at Sagaponack. His last novel, “In Paradise,” tells the story of a group that comes together for a meditative retreat at the site of a former Nazi death camp. Such retreats were familiar to him. He regularly welcomed Zen students to a zendo, a place of meditation, on his grounds. “Zen is really just a reminder to stay alive and to be awake,” he told the British newspaper The Guardian in 2002. “We tend to daydream all the time, speculating about the future and dwelling on the past. Zen practice is about appreciating your life in this moment. If you are truly aware of five minutes a day, then you are doing pretty well. We are beset by both the future and the past, and there is no reality apart from the here and now.” An earlier version of this obituary contained a number of errors. In one reference, the surname of Peter Matthiessen’s first wife, who died in 1998, was misspelled. She was Patsy Southgate, not Southgage. The given name of one of Mr. Matthiessen’s sons is Lucas, not Lukas or Luke. Mr. Matthiessen and George Plimpton attended St. Bernard’s school together in Manhattan, not the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. And Mr. Matthiessen’s novel “At Play in the Fields of the Lord” was set in Peru, not Brazil. An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Mr. Matthiessen’s book “In the Spirit of Crazy Horse.” While Mr. Matthiessen and the book’s publisher, Viking Press, were sued for libel damages, Viking did not “withdraw the book” as a result.

Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea. China's landing bomber aircraft at Woody Island has also raised tensions,\\" the Pentagon statement said. \\"We have called on China to remove the military systems immediately and to reverse course on the militarization of disputed South China Sea features,\\" the statement added. \\"We believe these recent deployments and the continued...

Please briefly summarize this news article: Parade turns to vigil for Kansas teen who dies hours before homecoming Undated photo of Taylor Heersche What was supposed to be a welcome-home parade instead turned into a somber candlelight vigil for a terminally ill 15-year-old Kansas girl who died hours before she was to return home. Residents of the town of Mulvane had decorated Main Street with ribbons and signs in orange — the color of leukemia awareness — to welcome Taylor Heersche home Tuesday evening, The Wichita Eagle reported. Taylor had been terminally ill with cancer and had told her family she wanted to be at home to die. Doctors at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City told the family she had only a few more days to live, so the plan was to release her to be with her family and friends. But Taylor passed away Tuesday morning at the hospital, with her parents, DeAnne and Dan Heersche, at her side. Instead of the parade, Mulvane residents gathered for a candlelight vigil late Tuesday to honor the Mulvane High School sophomore, the Eagle reported. “I’ll bet every parent says that their kid was special. But she was a real people person. There were no strangers,” DeAnne Heersche said of her daughter, according to the Eagle. “That kind of kid leaves a huge hole not only in our family, but in the community. We’re all going to miss her horribly.” Watch the most-viewed videos on NBCNews.com \\"It's still a homecoming in our eyes, it's just a different home that she's going to, a better home that she's going to, so it's more of a celebration than the grief,\\" Maggie Keys, one of Taylor's classmates, was quoted as saying by KWCH-TV. Taylor, a sophomore at Mulvane High School, was diagnosed with the leukemia in May 2008 when she was 10. Taylor's leukemia had been in remission for several years following chemotherapy. But last winter the cancer returned aggressively. Services are Sunday at Central Community Church in Wichita, with a private burial Monday.

They decorated the town's Main Street with orange ribbons and signs, because orange is the color for leukemia awareness.

The violent ambush that killed five Dallas police officers and wounded seven more could have been a lot worse, the city's police chief says. Dallas Chief of Police David Brown told CNN Sunday that the slain gunman told police negotiators he wanted to \\"kill white people, especially white officers.\\" Bomb making materials and a journal were found at Johnson's home during a search Friday. \\"The material were such that it was large enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our North Texas area,\\" Brown said. Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, was killed by police in the deadly attack Thursday night during a protest against police killings of African American men. Since the shooting deaths of two black men by white police officers over two days last week, protests have been held across the country. Scores of demonstrators have been arrested, with one flash point being the southern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where DeRay McKesson, one of the most prominent activists linked to the police reform protest movement Black Lives Matter, live streamed his own arrest. Police defended his arrest as a matter of public safety, but demonstrators told U.S. news outlets they believe McKesson was targeted. McKesson was freed on bond Sunday afternoon after being charged with obstructing a highway. \\"I remain disappointed in the Baton Rouge police, who continue to provoke protesters for peacefully protesting.

Still reeling from her husband's death, Sarah is now moody and depressed. That evening, a mysterious woman (Dalle) arrives at Sarah's door, asking to use the telephone to call for help. Sarah lies that her husband is sleeping and she does not want to be disturbed, but the woman tells her that she knows that he is dead. When the visitor persists on coming in, Sarah, a professional photographer, attempts to take her photo through a window and telephones the police. When they arrive, the woman has already vanished. The police assure Sarah that she will be fine, but arrange to have a patrol car visit throughout the night. Upon developing her photos, Sarah recognizes the woman in the background of an earlier photo she had taken, indicating she was stalking Sarah.

Text: The Rock is a 1996 American action thriller film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and written by David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook. The film stars Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris, with William Forsythe and Michael Biehn co-starring. It is dedicated to Simpson, who died five months before its release. The film received moderately positive reviews from critics, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound at the 69th Academy Awards. It was a box office success, grossing over 335 million against a production budget of 75 million. Question: is the movie the rock based on a true story?","completion":"The movie \\"The Rock\\" (1996) is not based on a true story but rather an original work of fiction created by writers David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook. The film's plot revolves around a rogue group of United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance members led by retired Brigadier General Frank Hummel (played by Ed Harris), who take control of the infamous Alcatraz Island in San Francisco. Their aim is to force the U.S. government to pay reparations to the families of fallen soldiers who died during covert missions. The story features a chemist named Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (played by Nicolas Cage) and former British Secret Service Agent John Mason (played by Sean Connery) as the protagonists trying to stop the rogue military group from launching deadly VX gas rockets into San Francisco. Although the film employs a fictional narrative, it also incorporates real-life elements, such as the setting of Alcatraz Island, which was a federal prison from 1934 to 1963 and is now a popular tourist attraction. The storyline draws inspiration from the public's fascination with secret government operations and espionage, but there is no factual basis for the events presented in the movie. \\"The Rock\\" is an amalgamation of various action and political thriller tropes, crafted to entertain the audience and showcase the talents of the actors involved.

WikiLeaks founder defends website in online session WikiLeaks army of secret spillers Click here to see readers' questions and responses from Julian Assange. London, England (CNN) -- WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange continued Friday to defend the website's posting of confidential U.S. documents, saying that no one in its four-year publishing history has been harmed as a result of material it put online. \\"During that time there has been no credible allegation, even by (organizations) like the Pentagon, that even a single person has come to harm as a result of our activities,\\" Assange said in written answers to readers' questions posted on the website of the British newspaper The Guardian. \\"This is despite much-attempted manipulation and spin trying to lead people to a counter-factual conclusion,\\" Assange said. \\"We do not expect any change in this regard.\\" Assange's whereabouts have been undisclosed since WikiLeaks began publishing 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables earlier this week. He is wanted by authorities in Sweden on unrelated allegations of sex crimes, including rape. Assange has denied the accusations, calling them a smear campaign. He has said he has long feared retribution for his website's disclosures. Investigators have focused much of their effort on finding Assange in Britain, where U.S. investigative activity is being conducted by the Defense Department, a senior law enforcement official told CNN Friday. The FBI's limited role in the case has centered on the exchange of investigative information with British authorities, the official said. The FBI routinely staffs its permanent office in the U.S. Embassy in London with 12 people -- seven agents and five support personnel. It has not beefed up its presence since authorities began searching for Assange, the official said. British police asked Swedish authorities Thursday for details not specified in an initial arrest warrant for Assange. That fact probably means a procedural problem is preventing them from arresting Assange, a U.S. expert on extradition said. The additional details could provide them with a valid warrant. \\"They either know where he is or they have been watching him,\\" said Douglas McNabb, a lawyer who specializes in federal criminal defense law and extradition cases. \\"There's some legal problem there.\\" Aggange has not been seen in public since November 18, when the Stockholm Criminal Court issued an international arrest warrant. Swedish authorities said they do not know where Assange is, but Anne Ramberg, secretary general of the Swedish Bar Association, said Thursday that it would be reasonable to assume that Sweden suspects Assange is in Britain, given the exchange of information over the warrant. Assange's British lawyer told CNN on Wednesday that security services in a number of countries know exactly where Assange is. \\"We have a cooperative approach between our security services in the UK and those in Sweden,\\" said Mark Stephens. \\"And they do with the U.S.A. So all the information about Julian and his movements, I think, would be pretty transparent amongst NATO allies.\\" Assange's answers to readers' questions on Friday began appearing on The Guardian's website an hour later than originally scheduled. He addressed a broad range of topics, from threats to his own safety to WikiLeaks' impact on the world. Assange said he had become a \\"lightning rod\\" and urged that those who have said he should be killed should be charged with incitement to commit murder. \\"I originally tried hard for (WikiLeaks) to have no face, because I wanted egos to play no part in our activities,\\" he said. \\"In the end, someone must be responsible to the public and only a leadership that is willing to be publicly courageous can genuinely suggest that sources take risks for the greater good. In that process, I have become the lightening rod. I get undue attacks on every aspect of my life, but then I also get undue credit as some kind of balancing force.\\" But he said the heroes of his endeavor are the sources who take the risks to deliver the information, and without whom journalists would amount to nothing. \\"If indeed it is the case, as alleged by the Pentagon, that the young soldier -- Bradley Manning -- is behind some of our recent disclosures, then he is without doubt an unparalleled hero,\\" Assange said. The U.S. military has charged Manning, a U.S. Army private who was an intelligence analyst, with eight violations of the U.S. Criminal Code for transferring classified data. Assange, 39, said he misses his native Australia but noted that that was unlikely. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Attorney General Robert McClelland \\"have made it clear that not only is my return impossible but that they are actively working to assist the United States government in its attacks on myself and our people. \\"This brings into question what does it mean to be an Australian citizen -- does that mean anything at all?\\" Assange asked. \\"Or are we all to be treated like David Hicks at the first possible opportunity, merely so that Australian politicians and diplomats can be invited to the best US Embassy cocktail parties.\\" Hicks, an Australian citizen, was detained without charges at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He pleaded guilty to providing material support to the al Qaeda terrorist network and, under a plea deal, was sentenced to nine months in jail. A question Assange did not answer came from someone using the handle of JAnthony and identified as a former British diplomat. JAnthony wrote about his experiences and the importance of protecting diplomatic correspondence. He then asked Assange why he should not be held personally responsible when diplomats are not able to function confidentially any more and the next global crisis goes unresolved. Assange, whose website has said it will take months to publish all of the cables, responded: \\"If you trim the vast editorial letter to the singular question actually asked, I would be happy to give it my attention.\\" Assange blamed \\"abusive elements of the United States government\\" for some of the technical problems his website has experienced since April.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.

Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power. Answer this question please: Is Ned's garden at more or less risk of hypoxia than Bobby's garden? Answer:","completion":"Ned's garden is at a higher risk of hypoxia than Bobby's garden. The flooding in Ned's garden, potentially caused by his daughter using a hose at full power, has created an environment where oxygen diffusion is significantly slower due to the presence of water. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen and become hypoxic, which is an environment with an O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter. In contrast, Bobby's garden is not flooded, which means it retains better oxygen availability and lower risk of hypoxia."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

At some point in time, the continent of MU experienced a great drought that lasted for several years. The other continent, Lemuria, was unaffected by the drought. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which continent had fewer small-beaked birds die in the drought? Hint: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided, the continent of Lemuria had fewer small-beaked birds die in the drought. This is because the continent of MU experienced a great drought that lasted for several years, affecting the food sources of the bird population, particularly those with small beaks. These birds could only eat the smaller seeds and, due to the drought, there were fewer seeds available for them to eat. On the other hand, Lemuria did not experience the drought and consequently, its bird population was not similarly affected, and small-beaked birds on this continent would not have faced the same challenges as those in MU."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They comprise two related groups, the Toka (Batoka) and the Leya (Baleya), and they speak dialects of the Tonga language. - The Cable News Network (CNN) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel owned by the Turner Broadcasting System division of Time Warner. It was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel; however, by April 2016, a CNN executive officially described the channel as \\"no longer a TV news network\\" and instead as \\"a 24-hour global multiplatform network.\\" Upon its launch, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage, and was the first all-news television channel in the United States. - Modern-day Matabeleland is a region in Zimbabwe divided into three provinces: Matabeleland North, Bulawayo and Matabeleland South. These provinces are in the west and south-west of Zimbabwe, between the Limpopo and Zambezi rivers. The region is named after its inhabitants the Ndebele people. Other ethnic groups who inhabit parts of Matabeleland include the Tonga, Kalanga, Venda and other peoples. As of August 2012, according to the ZIMSAT or Zimbabwe national statistics agency, the southern part of the region had 683,893 people, with the make up of 326,697 males and 356,926 females with an average size household of 4.4 in an area of . As for the Matabeleland Northern Province, it had a total population of 749,017 people out of the population of Zimbabwe of 13,061,239. The proportion of male and female population was 48 and 52 percent respectively within an area of just over . The remaining Bulawayo province had a population of 653,337 in an area of . Thus the region has a combined population of 2,086,247 in an area of just over and that is just over the size of England. The major city is Bulawayo, other notable towns are Plumtree and Hwange. The land is particularly fertile but dry. This area has important gold deposits. Industries include gold and other mineral mines, and engineering. There has been a decline in the industries in this region as water is in short supply. Promises by the government to draw water for the region through the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project have not been carried out. The region is allegedly marginalised by the government. - A waterfall is a place where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of drops in the course of a stream or river. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf. - Victoria Falls is a town in the province of Matabeleland North , Zimbabwe . It lies on the southern bank of the Zambezi River at the western end of the Victoria Falls themselves . It is connected by road and railway to Hwange ( 109 km away ) and Bulawayo ( 440 km away ) , both to the south - east . According to the 2012 Population Census , the town had a population of 33,060 . Victoria Falls Airport is located 18 km south of the town and has international services to Johannesburg and Namibia . The settlement began in 1901 when the possibility of using the waterfall for hydro - electric power was explored , and expanded when the railway from Bulawayo reached the town shortly before the Victoria Falls Bridge was opened in April 1905 , connecting Zimbabwe to what is now Zambia . It became the principal tourism centre for the Falls , experiencing economic booms from the 1930s to the 1960s and in the 1980s and early 1990s . - Bulawayo is the second-largest city in Zimbabwe after the capital Harare, with, as of the 2012 census, a population of 653,337. It is located in Matabeleland, 439 km (273 mi) southwest of Harare, and is now treated as a separate provincial area from Matabeleland. The capital of Matabeleland North is now Lupane, as Bulawayo is a stand-alone province. - The Republic of Zambia is a landlocked country in Southern Africa, neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to the south, and Angola to the west. The capital city is Lusaka, in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt Province to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country. - Hwange is a town in Zimbabwe, located in Hwange District, in Matabeleland North Province, in northwestern Zimbabwe, close to the international borders with Botswana and Zambia. It lies approximately , by road, southeast of Victoria Falls, the nearest large city. The town lies on the railway line from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city, to Victoria Falls. Hwange sits at an elevation of , above sea level. - Harare (officially called Salisbury until 1982) is the capital and most populous city of Zimbabwe. Situated in the north-east of the country in the heart of historic Mashonaland, the city has an estimated population of 1,606,000 (2009), with 2,800,000 in its metropolitan area (2006). Administratively, Harare is a metropolitan province, which also incorporates Chitungwiza town and Epworth. It is situated at an elevation of above sea level and its climate falls into the subtropical highland category. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos.

Think more suburban adventure rather than skydiving or wild camping. But, over the years I have ended up overcoming a few challenges that I hadn’t precisely expected to be faced with. This blog has always been, and will forever more be a record of my personal adventures. It is a journal of the chaos, delight, opportunities and travails that we encounter all rolled in with an obsession for photography (as far as my skillz extend) and a dash of humour (well, I try anyway). DRIVING IN AMERICA Covering 800 miles of American freeways in less than 10 days is something I never thought I’d do to be honest – an inexperienced driver at best I’ve driven short distances (and through a Florida tropical storm from Cape Canaveral back to our Orlando apartment) – but somehow we survived unscathed driving diagonally the length of Louisiana from New Orleans to Shreveport, through the crazy traffic of Dallas and along the long, undulating motorways of Texas. I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine. COMMUNICATING IN OTHER LANGUAGES You’ve decided where to go, booked the flight, found a hotel, decided what to do… and then you get to your destination.

Dans ces conditions d'humidité élevée, la structure du carton ondulé devient moins efficace pour résister aux contraintes mécaniques auxquelles il est soumis. Cela est dû au fait que l'humidité pénètre dans les fibres de cellulose qui composent le carton, ce qui provoque une diminution de la rigidité et de la solidité de l'ensemble du matériau. En conséquence, les boîtes en carton ondulé sont moins capables de protéger leur contenu contre les impacts et les forces de compression. De plus, l'humidité élevée peut également provoquer une dégradation plus rapide des cartons ondulés en raison de la croissance de moisissures et autres micro-organismes. Ces organismes peuvent dégrader les fibres de cellulose et réduire encore davantage la résistance et la durée de vie du carton. Il existe plusieurs solutions pour remédier à ce problème, telles que l'ajout de couches imperméables ou hydrofuges dans les boîtes en carton ondulé, l'utilisation de matériaux alternatifs plus résistants à l'humidité, ou le contrôle de l'humidité ambiante dans les espaces de stockage et de transport.

Information: - Forage fish, also called prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right. - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is... - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals. - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\"). - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats. - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances. - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems. - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates. - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals. - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin. - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing. - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\" a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish). - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century. - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder. - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth.

Paris, France (CNN) -- She's been called \\"beautiful,\\" \\"hot\\" and \\"sexy\\" but when it comes to tennis, the most apt description for Maria Sharapova has to be \\"tough.\\" The Russian rallied from a set down three straight times to reach this year's French Open final and then prevailed in Saturday's thrilling three-hour finale against rising star Simona Halep, 6-4 6-7 6-4. \\"This is the toughest grand slam final I've ever played,\\" Sharapova, who was contesting a ninth such match, summed up as she collected her trophy. Even after losing the second set and hitting a flurry of double faults, Sharapova still had the edge. She's almost a sure thing in third sets on clay, having triumphed 20 times in a row.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Andrew Young says John Edwards asked him to fake paternity test on Rielle Hunter's baby BoundsAP; SussmanGetty John Edwards has reportedly split from Elizabeth Edwards and admitted to fathering Rielle Hunter's baby. Prissy presidential candidate John Edwards wanted a paternity test done on his mistress' baby but didn't want to get his hands dirty - so he had a flunky steal a diaper. That filthy tale emerged Thursday on the same day the former North Carolina senator finally came clean and admitted fathering the almost 2-year-old daughter of Rielle Hunter. No sooner did Edwards reconfirm that he is both a cad and a liar, when NBC News reported that he and his incurable-cancer-stricken wife had separated. It appeared that even Elizabeth Edwards, who publicly stood by her louse of a spouse, had enough of the onetime Democratic Party darling who paid more attention to combing his tresses than telling the truth. Edwards didn't have the nerve to face the cameras - he claimed paternity of Frances Quinn Hunter in a statement. \\"I am Quinn's father,\\" Edwards wrote. \\"It was wrong for me ever to deny she was my daughter, and hopefully one day, when she understands, she will forgive me.\\" Edwards also apologized for lying to supporters. \\"To all those I have disappointed and hurt, these words will never be enough, but I am truly sorry,\\" he said. The awful admissions came a week before ABC News' \\"2-0/20\\" was to air an exclusive interview with Edwards' former aide Andrew Young whose book on the sordid affair, \\"The Politician,\\" is due out next month. Blinded by loyalty, Young - a married father of three - tried to take the fall for his boss by claiming he was Quinn's daddy. He later admitted that, too, was a lie. Edwards' sudden decision to fess up prompted ABC to dribble out excerpts of an exclusive interview Bob Woodruff did with Young, which airs in full Jan. 29. They revealed Edwards was desperate to distance himself from the daughter he professes to love. \\"Get a doctor to fake the DNA results,\\" Young said Edwards told him. \\"And he asked me ... to steal a diaper from the baby so he could secretly do a DNA test to find out if this [was] indeed his child.\\" Elizabeth Edwards told the Associated Press \\"the whole family's relieved\\" by the long-belated confession. As for their future, she claimed not to have a clue. \\"If somebody has a crystal ball, they can let me know,\\" she said. Not so long ago, Elizabeth Edwards insisted it did not matter to her whether her husband fathered a child with Hunter. \\"That would be a part of John's life, but not a part of mine,\\" she said. Friends say she is living in the family home while Edwards bunks at the beach house. A former campaign aide said they are apparently separated. \\"To my knowledge, they are still trying to appear they are together. Nobody thinks they are under the same roof.\\" ||||| For the first time, John Edwards is publicly admitting that he is indeed the father of a 2-year-old daughter conceived with Rielle Hunter, a campaign videographer with whom he had an affair. In a written statement provided exclusively to NBC News, the former North Carolina senator and Democratic presidential candidate says he’s taking responsibility for the child, Frances Quinn Hunter: “I am Quinn’s father. I will do everything in my power to provide her with the love and support she deserves. I have been able to spend time with her during the past year and trust that future efforts to show her the love and affection she deserves can be done privately and in peace. It was wrong for me ever to deny she was my daughter and hopefully one day, when she understands, she will forgive me. I have been providing financial support for Quinn and have reached an agreement with her mother to continue providing support in the future. To all those I have disappointed and hurt these words will never be enough, but I am truly sorry.” Harrison Hickman, Edwards’ close friend and personal adviser, spoke to NBC’s Lisa Myers on Edwards’ behalf. “The senator wants to say, first of all, that he is the father of Quinn,” Hickman said. “Secondly, he wants people to know that he has provided for her and will continue to provide for her, as he should, both financially and emotionally.” Edwards is not speaking publicly today, at least in part because of an ongoing federal investigation into whether campaign money was used to try to cover up the affair. He has denied wrongdoing. Hickman said that Edwards wanted to be honest about his child, but also wanted to protect his privacy. “He’s not doing this as a way to try to bring attention to himself,” Hickman said. “He’s doing this as a way … to begin to put this behind, not just him, but everybody else who’s been affected by this.” Edwards’ attorneys say he’s been seeing Quinn and providing financial support for about a year, and just signed a child support agreement with Hunter. A spokesperson for Elizabeth Edwards says she learned last summer that Quinn is her husband’s child. Why wait more than two years to publicly admit paternity? “He has acknowledged it long before now. The reason it has taken so long for it to become public is thatthere were a lot of people involved,” Hickman said. “There are a lot of adults involved, there are a number of families involved, and there are also a lot of kids involved.” Fall of the man who sought presidency Today’s announcement marks another chapter in the fall of a man once considered a leading candidate for president. Edwards’ personal and political troubles began after the tabloid National Enquirer began reporting in October 2007 on his affair with Hunter, now 45. In 2007, the National Enquirer began reporting that John Edwards had had an affair with Rielle Hunter. Edwards called the reports “lies.” Edwards, who has been married to breast cancer survivor Elizabeth for 32 years, denied the affair at first. He called the claims “tabloid trash that’s full of lies.” In 2008, after his failed presidential bid, Edwards eventually confirmed to ABC News that he had had an affair with Hunter, but he vehemently denied that he was the father of Hunter’s child. “I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events,” Edwards told ABC News at the time. Now Hickman says, “I do not know if he knew it was his daughter at the time, but I know he lied when he said it was not possible … I think he is certainly regretful of that.” This campaign photo shows John Edwards with both his wife, Elizabeth (far left), and mistress, videographer Rielle Hunter (holding camera at right). Edwards’ admission today also indicates that his relationship with Hunter continued months after his wife announced that her cancer had returned and that it was incurable. Elizabeth Edwards is still undergoing cancer treatment and makes occasional appearances about health care. Last summer she opened a furniture shop in Chapel Hill, N.C., not far from the family’s mansion. “Elizabeth thinks he should acknowledge this,” Hickman said. “It's been a very difficult time for everyone, but for Elizabeth, I think, more than anyone else, it's been a difficult time.” Harrison Hickman, a close friend and adviser to John Edwards, spoke to NBC News on the former presidential candidate’s behalf. Hickman said Edwards wanted to “do the right thing” and come clean in the summer of 2008, but that he couldn’t bring himself to do so. “It was complicated … certainly more complicated than I knew,” Hickman explained. “He had to be able to talk to Elizabeth about it. He had to be able to talk to Rielle about it. He had to talk to us [and] his children about it. He had to deal with legal issues involving support for the child.” Once the legal issues were resolved, Hickman said, Edwards “wanted to move forward immediately with letting people know about it.” Hickman said he didn’t know the status of Edwards’ relationships with Hunter or his wife, but other family friends say John and Elizabeth have separated, at least for now, but still talk on a regular basis. In a written statement to NBC News, John Edwards said it was wrong for him ever to deny the daughter he fathered with Rielle Hunter. Edwards bought a house for Quinn and her mother to live in in Charlotte, N.C., more than two hours away from his home in Chapel Hill. Now, Hickman said, the former senator is trying to stay out of the public spotlight and focus his energy on family and doing good deeds like helping the poor. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"So, there was a man named John Edwards who once wanted to be the President of the United States.

Then, he took a long time to finally say, \\"Yes, I am the baby's daddy.\\" People were very disappointed with John for lying. Even his wife Elizabeth, who was very sick, was sad about what John did.

A beret, knit beanie, or pompom hat is ideal for keeping her head warm, while a cashmere, wool, or knit scarf can be wrapped around her neck. Fingerless gloves or mittens with removable tops can provide warmth and functionality. 7. Footwear: In mild winter weather, Barbie can choose from various stylish footwear options, such as ankle boots, knee-high boots, or even fashionable sneakers. Waterproof or insulated shoes will keep her feet warm and dry during this time. In conclusion, dressing up for a mild winter day involves a combination of style and comfort. By choosing the right clothing items and accessories, Barbie can take advantage of this unique weather situation and create a fashionable and cozy wardrobe suitable for the outdoors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The People's Court, an American television court show, has been on the air since its debut in 1981.

The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized.

Once the official tally is confirmed, Yingluck is expected to form a coalition government with several smaller parties, securing an even stronger majority in the Thai parliament. With this mandate, Yingluck pledges to focus on economic reforms and social programs aimed at reducing inequality and fostering sustainable development. However, critics of the Pheu Thai party, which is closely linked with Yingluck's controversial brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, worry that the new government may further divide the country. As Yingluck prepares to take office, she knows that her leadership will be closely scrutinized both domestically and internationally. As Thailand's first female prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra brings a new face to Thai politics and the hopes of many for a more stable, prosperous future.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: King was born in Long Beach, California, into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of Betty (nee Jerman), a housewife, and Bill Moffitt, a firefighter. Billie Jean's family was athletic. Her mother excelled at swimming, her father played basketball, baseball and ran track. Her younger brother, Randy Moffitt, became a Major League Baseball pitcher, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays. King's triumph at the French Open in 1972 made her only the fifth woman in tennis history to win the singles titles at all four Grand Slam events, a \\"career Grand Slam.\\" King also won a career Grand Slam in mixed doubles. In women's doubles, only the Australian Open eluded her. King won a record 20 career titles at Wimbledon - six in singles, 10 in women's doubles, and four in mixed doubles. King played 51 Grand Slam singles events from 1959 through 1983, reaching at least the semifinals in 27 and at least the quarterfinals in 40 of her attempts. King was the runner-up in six Grand Slam singles events. An indicator of King's mental toughness in Grand Slam singles tournaments was her 11-2 career record in deuce third sets, i.e., third sets that were tied 5-5 before being resolved. King won 129 singles titles, 78 of which were WTA titles, and her career prize money totaled US1,966,487. In Federation Cup finals, King was on the winning United States team seven times, in 1963, 1966, 1967, and 1976 through 1979. Her career win-loss record was 52-4. She won the last 30 matches she played, including 15 straight wins in both singles and doubles. In Wightman Cup competition, King's career win-loss record was 22-4, winning her last nine matches. The United States won the cup ten of the 11 years that King participated. In singles, King was 6-1 against Ann Haydon-Jones, 4-0 against Virginia Wade, and 1-1 against Christine Truman Janes. In 1982, King was 38 years old and the twelfth-seed at Wimbledon. In her third round match with Tanya Harford of South Africa, King was down 7-5, 5-4 (40-0) before saving three match points to win the second set 7-6(2) and then the third set 6-3. King said in her post-match press conference, \\"I can't recall the previous time I have been so close to defeat and won. When I was down 4-5 and love-40, I told myself, 'You have been here 21 years, so use that experience and hang on.'\\" In the fourth round, King upset sixth-seeded Australian Wendy Turnbull in straight sets. King then upset third-seeded Tracy Austin in the quarterfinals 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 to become the oldest female semifinalist at Wimbledon since Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers in 1920. This was King's first career victory over Austin after five defeats and reversed the result of their 1979 Wimbledon quarterfinal. King said in her post-match press conference, \\"Today, I looked at the scoreboard when I was 2-0 in the third set and the '2' seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. In 1979, when I was up 2-0 at the same stage, I was tired and didn't have anything left. But today I felt so much better and was great mentally.\\" Two days later in the semifinals, which was King's 250th career match at Wimbledon in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles, the second-seeded Chris Evert defeated King on her fifth match point 7-6(4), 2-6, 6-3. King was down a set and 2-1 in the second set before winning five consecutive games to even the match. King explained that she actually lost the match in the first set by failing to convert break points at 15-40 in the second and fourth games. She reached the semifinals in her final appearance at Wimbledon, losing to Andrea Jaeger 6-1, 6-1 after beating Kathy Jordan in the quarterfinals, seventh-seeded Wendy Turnbull in the fourth round, and Rosemary Casals, her longtime doubles partner, in the third round. Jaeger claims that she was highly motivated to defeat King because King had defeated Turnbull, a favorite of Jaeger's, and because King refused a towel from an attendant just before her match with Jaeger, explaining, \\"I'm not going to sweat in this match.\\" King became the oldest WTA player to win a singles tournament when she won the Edgbaston Cup grass court tournament in Birmingham at 39 years, 7 months and 23 days after a straight-sets victory in the final against Alycia Moulton. The final official singles match of King's career was a second round loss to Catherine Tanvier at the 1983 Australian Open. Before the start of the open era in 1968, King earned US100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments. In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the USLTA's practice of \\"shamateurism\\", where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism. King said this about the amateur game, In America, tennis players are not people. If you are in tennis, you are a cross between a panhandler and a visiting in-law. You're not respected, you're tolerated. In England, you're respected as an artist. In Europe, you're a person of importance. Manuel Santana gets decorated by Franco. The Queen leads the applause.

Sentence 1: \\"The man couldn't lift his son because he was so weak.\\" Sentence 2: \\"The son was so weak.\\" Is sentence 2 true, based on sentence 1?","completion":"Yes, sentence 2 is true based on the information given in sentence 1. In sentence 1, we are told that \\"the man couldn't lift his son because he was so weak.\\" The use of the word \\"he\\" is a pronoun that refers to one of the two males mentioned in the sentence – the man or his son. In this case, the context suggests that \\"he\\" is referring to the man, meaning that the man was too weak to lift his son. However, we must also acknowledge that sentence 1 does not explicitly give any details about the son's physical state. It is possible for a weak person to lift another person who is also weak, as long as the person being lifted is not too heavy for the person doing the lifting. In this specific scenario, the son's level of weakness is not the factor that directly determines the man's inability to lift him. Thus, we can say that sentence 2 (\\"The son was so weak\\") is true based on the assumption that the man's weakness is at least partly attributable to the son's weakness. However, this conclusion would not be definite based on sentence 1 alone, as it does not directly comment on the son's level of strength."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Schultz then begins a relationship with Weinberg's beautiful, married, girlfriend, Drew Preston. Facing legal charges in a court in upstate New York, Schultz brings Billy and Drew along. He successfully charms the locals, presenting himself as charming and good natured. While his boss Dutch stands trial, Billy's job is to watch over Drew. His loyalties to Schultz are tested as he begins falling in love with the flirtatious Drew. Realizing that Drew is about to be killed, Billy calls her husband, who hurries to town and takes her home before Schultz's men can make their move. Having beaten the rap in court, Dutch is indicted again on federal tax evasion charges. He wants to have federal prosecutor Thomas Dewey murdered, but his request is rejected by the Mafia Commission. Schultz sends Billy to another gangster with some bribe money, but the effort is rejected. When Billy returns with the bad news, he and Schultz have a falling out and Billy is fired by Schultz's associate Otto, who lets him keep the bribe money as a severance package.

Joseph had always hated kids.; b). Nelson had always hated kids.;","completion":"Nelson had always hated kids. Growing up, Nelson had never liked being surrounded by children. All the noise, the chaos, and the constant supervision they required frustrated him. He was more of a solitary person, calm and composed, while kids were – well, little storm clouds creating havoc wherever they went. Joseph, on the other hand, was the kind of person who could effortlessly walk into a room full of kids and have them hang onto every word he said. He knew how to guide them with patience and kindness, and he somehow managed to make every learning experience enjoyable and engaging. Joseph and Nelson had been friends since childhood, and they had decided to pursue teaching as a career, both hoping it would help them make a positive impact on the lives of young people. As the teaching course progressed, it became more and more evident that Nelson's initial misgivings about dealing with kids weren't going to fade away. During his required in-class training, he found it difficult to connect with the students, often leaving him frustrated and disheartened. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't see the innate potential and curiosity in them that Joseph seemed to so effortlessly discover. One day, after a particularly difficult training session, Nelson confided in Joseph about his struggles. He felt that perhaps teaching wasn't the right path for him after all. A concerned Joseph listened carefully and pondered over his friend's dilemma. After giving it some thought, he suggested that maybe Nelson could benefit from observing his techniques and methods, hoping it would give him the confidence and inspiration he needed to thrive as a teacher. Over the next few weeks, Nelson accompanied Joseph to his training sessions. He watched intently as Joseph effortlessly captured the attention of his students, creating an atmosphere of camaraderie and warmth in the classroom. The kids would listen intently, engaging with the material, and asking questions that clearly showed they wanted to learn more. It was truly inspirational. Inspired by his friend's approach, Nelson began to adopt some of Joseph's strategies. He tried being more patient with the students, seeking ways to engage them by tapping into their interests and personalities. Rather than just focusing on the subject matter, Nelson started to prioritize building a rapport with the students, recognizing their individuality and potential. Slowly but surely, Nelson began to see a change in himself. The knot of frustration that used to occupy his chest every time he entered a classroom started to loosen. The students were opening up to him and, to his surprise, he found himself enjoying their company. His new approach was paying off, as the kids were responding positively to his efforts, and for the first time, Nelson recognized that he, too, could make an impact on their lives. Although it was a slow and arduous process, Nelson's perseverance and the unwavering support of his friend, Joseph, helped him transcend his initial feelings of disdain towards children. Ultimately, he became a dedicated teacher who took pride in helping shape the minds and hearts of young people. Joseph and Nelson’s commitment to teaching went beyond just fulfilling their professional pursuits. It became a representation of their strong bond and a testament to how even the most ingrained beliefs can change with the right mindset and influence. United in their passion and respect for education, they went on to make lasting and meaningful contributions to the lives of countless students, proving that sometimes even the most unlikely person can turn adversity into a flourishing and fulfilling existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a breakdown of the main elements in each sentence and why I reached this conclusion: 1. Chinese General's Son / Son of Chinese Army Singers - In both cases, the son belongs to important figures connected to the Chinese military, which implies a certain level of notoriety for the individual and possibility of public interest in the case. However, they do describe different relationships (general and army singers), which makes this aspect not completely identical. 2. 10 Years Jail / 10 Years' Jail - Both sentences mention the same punishment duration, which is a ten years imprisonment. This element is identical in both sentences. 3. Rape / Gang Rape - The crime committed in both cases is undoubtedly of a sexual nature, specifically rape. However, the second sentence refers to a gang rape, making it a more severe form of the crime. Therefore, these two aspects are similar in nature but not entirely the same. Taking these similarities and differences into account, I would rate the similarity as 4, which means the sentences have a high level of meaning overlap, but they do not mean exactly the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Based on the premise \\"Flanking the steps leading to the courtyard and standing on statues of tortoises are two bronze elephants with praying riders on their backs.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The bronze elephants stand alone in center of the empty courtyard. \\" is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"The bronze elephants stand alone in the center of the empty courtyard\\" is true. To better understand why this is the case, let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis further. Premise: \\"Flanking the steps leading to the courtyard and standing on statues of tortoises are two bronze elephants with praying riders on their backs.\\" In this premise, we have a few important pieces of information: 1. There are two bronze elephants. 2. The elephants are positioned on statues of tortoises. 3. The elephants are flanking, or positioned on either side of, the steps that lead to the courtyard. 4. The elephants have riders on their backs who are in a praying position. Now let's break down the hypothesis: \\"The bronze elephants stand alone in the center of the empty courtyard.\\" This hypothesis presents us with three new pieces of information about the elephants: 1. They are alone. 2. They are situated in the center of the courtyard. 3. The courtyard is empty. By comparing the premise to the hypothesis, we find that they do not align in key ways. The first discrepancy is the placement of the elephants. According to the premise, the elephants flank the steps leading to the courtyard, while the hypothesis claims that the elephants are in the center of the courtyard. These positions cannot simultaneously be true since the steps to the courtyard and the center of the courtyard are two distinct locations. Another inconsistency lies in the air of emptiness that the hypothesis describes. The empty courtyard would suggest that there are no other items or features within the space. However, the premise clearly states that the elephants stand on statues of tortoises and have riders on their backs. This information contradicts the hypothesis's depiction of an empty courtyard with standalone elephants. Since the premise and the hypothesis contain conflicting information regarding the placement of the bronze elephants and the contents of the courtyard, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the provided premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Emily didn't like to work in the yard but Cynthia found it pleasing.","completion":"While Emily eschewed yard work, preferring indoor activities that were far removed from the mess of the outdoors, Cynthia found a strange sense of peace in it. It wasn't just about digging through the earth and planting seeds for Cynthia. It was much more profound than that. Yard work, for her, was a tangible expression of the symbiotic relationship between humans and nature; a confirmation of life's enduring cycles. Every time Cynthia would plunge her spade into the cool, crumbly earth, she would be reminded of the intricate cycles that allowed such a simple act to bring forth life. She would imagine the seed, seemingly lifeless, buried in the darkness. Despite its humble beginnings, it would soon shoot forth, breaking the surface of the soil, zealously reaching for the warmth and light of the sun. This sense of continuity, this blend of mystery and miracle that was encapsulated in the act of gardening, was something that Emily found hard to comprehend. Emily, meanwhile, found her peace in more polished environs. She loved the clean lines of a well-organized office or the predictable click-clack of a keyboard. In the pragmatic rhythm of her daily tasks, Emily saw the comforting patterns of human order. There was no room for the surprises of nature, the dirt under your fingers, or the uncertainty that came with every planted seed. Everything Emily did had a tangible result, an immediate product. She spent her days creating reports and plans, organizing events, and building strategies to navigate the complexities of the business world. She loved the predictability of it all, the fact that she could control the variables and influence the outcome. In contrast, Cynthia's gardening seemed messy and unpredictable to her, a slave to the weather and the whims of the seasons. Emily had tried multiple times to find joy in yard work, attempting to understand what Cynthia found so pleasing. But each time, she ended up frustrated and disenchanted. She understood that nature had its own rhythm, its own pace that refused to bow down to human whims. This unpredictability, the uncertainty of whether a plant would bloom or die, was something that Emily found difficult to accept. Cynthia, however, loved the unpredictability that came with gardening. The patience required, the understanding of nature's cycles, the accepting of failure and rejoicing in success, was something that Cynthia found immensely gratifying. When she worked in the yard, she felt a free-flowing exchange of energy, a completeness that no indoor activity could provide. Their different outlooks created interesting dynamics between Emily and Cynthia. Yet, it was these differences that also allowed them to harmonize their lives, like two sides of a coin. They didn't need to like the same things. That was the beauty of it. Emily didn't have to enjoy working in the yard, just as Cynthia didn't have to enjoy working indoors. And so, their lives continued. Emily, with her love for indoor predictability, and Cynthia, with her passion for the outdoor uncertainty. It was an unspoken agreement, a mutual understanding, that made their coexistence not just possible, but also enjoyable. After all, what better way to enjoy life than by embracing one's differences, while respecting the passions and predilections of others?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Calling itself the Land League, the group has become embroiled in a campaign to stop an Irish bank from repossessing the home of a high-profile lawyer. The mansion, overlooking Dublin bay, sits within a seaside suburb so packed with Ireland's rich and famous that the tabloid press have dubbed it Bel Ã‰ire. The ostentatious address is an unusual setting for an anti-austerity campaign. The disputed mansion, on Vico Road, Killiney, is the family home of the solicitor and property developer Brian O'Donnell. It boasts a swimming pool and tennis courts. Before the crash, its owner built up a significant international property portfolio, but failed investments have left him with massive debts. But the family's decision to enlist the support of the Land League has added further intrigue to their fight to keep their mansion. The campaign group has tried to evoke a 19th Century movement that supported Irish tenant farmers facing rising rents and evictions by landlords who often lived outside Ireland. The original Land League was set up by Michael Davitt in 1879. He was born into poor tenant farming family in County Mayo at the height of Ireland's Great Famine. Unable to pay their rent, his family was evicted from their farm and emigrated to England. By the age of 11, Davitt was working in a Lancashire cotton mill, where he lost an arm in an industrial accident. On his return to Ireland as an adult, he saw that conditions had improved little for tenant farmers, and he led a campaign against the rising rents demanded by wealthy absentee landlords. Davitt became secretary of the Land League and the nationalist statesman, Charles Stewart Parnell, agreed to lead it as president. On its website, the new Land League quotes Parnell: \\"When a man takes a farm from which another had been evicted you must shun him on the roadside.\\" The group first grabbed the media's attention in July 2013, when its members disrupted a distressed property auction in Dublin - a fire sale of Celtic Tiger folly. The group's spokesman, Jerry Beades, said the Irish public still associated forced evictions with Davitt's Land League, and when a Parnell speech was quoted at the forcibly abandoned auction, they decided to adopt the name. The league's main aim is to stop evictions in the Republic of Ireland and it has called on the banks to allow homeowners to make \\" realistic\\" repayments. Most Irish anti-austerity protests have focused their anger on the banks, but property developers, to whom the banks lent recklessly, rarely escape their wrath. So, the sight of anti-austerity protesters campaigning to keep a property developer in his multi-million euros mansion has prompted much comment in the media. Writing in the Irish Independent, the economist David McWilliams said it was \\"less easy to feel sorry for the O'Donnell family's plight than it is for much poorer people\\" who are facing eviction from \\"much less salubrious\\" houses. However, Mr Beades told the same newspaper that the O'Donnells are \\"no different\\" to any other family facing repossession action. \\"When the Land League was first formed, there were big farmers thrown off land as well as small tenant farmers. They all stuck together.\\" He added: \\"Whether you owe 50,000 euros or 5m euros, the issues are the same.\\" In an interview with the BBC, Mr Beades said nearly half a million people in the state had debts they could not service. He said the O'Donnells had already paid back millions to Irish banks but Bank of Ireland was \\"trying to pursue them to ends of the earth\\". The Irish public would be \\"shocked\\" by the sight of a \\"masked receiver\\" nailing an eviction order to the gates of a family home, the league's spokesman said. Many Irish farmers have suffered a similar fate in recent years, but the media has not been interested in their plight, he added. When asked how many lower-profile cases the Land League had become involved in, Mr Beades said they have provided advice to \\"hundreds of families\\" facing eviction. He said in the last year alone, they have successfully resisted 10 evictions, where families have stayed in their homes. He added the group had \\"confronted\\" bailiffs in 10 other repossession cases. Mr Beades said he had been inside plenty of homes during eviction proceedings and the current atmosphere in the O'Donnell house was the just the same - difficult. He said several further court hearings were pending and added that the Land League intends to see the Gorse Hill case out \\"to the end\\". What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about a group called the Land League, which is trying to stop a bank in Ireland from taking away the home of a lawyer named Brian O'Donnell.

Question: \\"Where was the state song first sung by the troupe?\\" Context: \\"The state song was not composed until 21 years after statehood, when a musical troupe led by Joseph E. Howard stopped in Butte in September 1910. A former member of the troupe who lived in Butte buttonholed Howard at an after-show party, asking him to compose a song about Montana and got another partygoer, the city editor for the Butte Miner newspaper, Charles C. Cohan, to help. The two men worked up a basic melody and lyrics in about a half-hour for the entertainment of party guests, then finished the song later that evening, with an arrangement worked up the following day. Upon arriving in Helena, Howard's troupe performed 12 encores of the new song to an enthusiastic audience and the governor proclaimed it the state song on the spot, though formal legislative recognition did not occur until 1945. Montana is one of only three states to have a \\"state ballad\\", \\"Montana Melody\\", chosen by the legislature in 1983. Montana was the first state to also adopt a State Lullaby.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The state song, composed by Joseph E. Howard and Charles C. Cohan, was first sung by the troupe in Helena, Montana. This historical event occurred during the troupe's visit after they had stopped in Butte in September 1910. At an after-show party in Butte, a former member of the troupe and a city editor for the Butte Miner newspaper requested Howard to compose a song about Montana. The pair created a basic melody and lyrics within half an hour for the entertainment of the party guests and finished the song later that night, with a musical arrangement prepared the following day. Upon the troupe's arrival in Helena, they performed the song enthusiastically for the audience. It received such a warm reception that the governor proclaimed it the state song immediately, even though it took until 1945 for the song to gain formal legislative recognition. Montana holds historical significance as being the first state to adopt not only a state song but also a State Lullaby and a state ballad, \\"Montana Melody,\\" which was chosen by the legislature in 1983.

Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON — In the face of a storm of controversy and a slew of challengers, U.S. Rep. Blake Farenthold indicated Monday he's still running for re-election. This time around, it will likely be a lonely battle for the Corpus Christi Republican. \\"It's lonelier than it's been in past times, but he's not alone,\\" said Farenthold's chief of staff, Bob Haueter, on Monday evening. Farenthold found himself at the center of the sexual harassment firestorm engulfing the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 1 when Politico reported that he had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit using 84,000 in taxpayer funds. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Farenthold fiercely denies the accusations, both in public and in private, and he quickly pledged to pay back the 84,000 involved in the settlement. The issue initially faded away in 2014 after the settlement and after the U.S. House Office of Congressional Ethics, an advisory arm of the House, recommended the member-driven U.S. House Ethics Committee dismiss the charges against Farenthold. The controversy continued to dog him after the U.S. House Ethics Committee announced recently that it would give the allegations a closer examination. Then on Friday, the Houston Chronicle reported that Farenthold and his entire congressional staff underwent sexual harassment training in 2016 after the he was accused of gender discrimination. And late Monday, The New York Times published fresh accounts culled from former staffers and legal documents describing Farenthold's office as a \\"hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo.\\" All this sets the stage for the fight of Farenthold's career. Five Republicans have launched bids to unseat Farenthold in his 27th Congressional district, most prominently former Texas Water Development Board chairman Bech Bruun, who resigned from that post and filed to run as a Republican for the congressional seat Friday. Others include Michael Cloud, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee and former chairman of the Victoria County GOP. On the Democratic side, at least four Democrats have lined up for potential campaigns. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Democrats are candid about the seat being out of reach for them, meaning Farenthold’s biggest hurdle is in the GOP primary. The crowded field increases the odds of a runoff, and a rule of thumb in Texas politics is that it is near-impossible for an incumbent to survive the second round of a primary. Farenthold's political troubles come amid — and in large part due to — an environment of increased sensitivity to sexual misconduct in Washington, D.C. Two female Republican members from out of state, U.S. Reps. Mia Love of Utah and Barbara Comstock of Virginia, have called on Farenthold to not just retire but resign. Democrats last week purged two favorites from their ranks: U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and U.S. Rep. John Conyers of Michigan announced their resignations. Franken did so in a highly reluctant matter, suggesting he was a sacrificial lamb to allow Democrats to attain the moral high ground on the issue of sexual harassment. Liberals then quickly made Farenthold the poster boy of alleged harassment, and they demanded he resign. Failing that, they urged GOP leadership to push him out. But leading Republicans — and Texas delegation members — remained silent. Democrats were quick to construe that as tacit approval of Farenthold's alleged behavior. In interviews with a dozen or so delegation insiders, they say it is a different story behind the scenes. Texas Republican members would prefer for Farenthold to step aside (he has until Tuesday to withdraw, but there are few signs he intends to do so). At the same time, there is little interest in publicly knifing him — that’s just not how things are done in the tight-knit delegation. Even so, if a new and credible allegation surfaces, Farenthold could see the political ground swiftly shift underneath him. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Most Texas Republican operatives predict his fundraising will dry up amid the bad publicity, and it’s unlikely GOP colleagues will rush to donate to his campaign, the common practice when a longtime incumbent is in political trouble. Despite all of those developments, Farenthold’s close advisers are sticking with him, and there is a clear sense of ire within his inner circle that the Office of Congressional Ethics' investigation and dismissal recommendation did not put the story to rest. A group of past and current employees circulated a letter defending Farenthold, describing him as having “always treated us fairly and with dignity and respect.\\" And he has the support of a prominent figure in Texas state politics: pollster Chris Wilson. “We wouldn’t work for someone who has been demonstrated to abuse women,” Wilson said. “But an accusation, especially one that has already been investigated, doesn’t make him guilty.” “I sat down with the congressman, his wife and his staff and after learning more about the process undertaken by the Office of Congressional Ethics, I agree with the OCE’s findings that the charges were unfounded,” he added. “And I’m proud to be part of his re-election effort as I believe Farenthold to be an honorable man.” Cassandra Pollock and Patrick Svitek contributed to this report.

Photo: Handout Photo Photo: Handout Photo Image 1 of / 59 Caption Close U.S. Rep. Farenthold acknowledges gender discrimination complaints by two more women 1 / 59 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON –Embattled Texas Republican Blake Farenthold, under fire in an ongoing sexual harassment probe, said Friday that he and his entire congressional staff underwent sensitivity and sexual harassment training last year after two female staffers complained of gender discrimination and \\"sexualized commentary\\" in his Capitol Hill office. The women's complaints in 2016 followed that of former spokeswoman Lauren Greene, who had recently settled a federal lawsuit that accused Farenthold of sexual harassment and of firing her in retaliation for her complaint. ICON OUT: Conyers resigns from Congress amid claims The new revelations, which Farenthold acknowledged to the Chronicle on Friday, bring to at least three the number of women who have complained of either sexual harassment, gender discrimination, or a hostile work environment in his office. Now Playing: Farenthold, a four-term congressman from Corpus Christi, has denied any wrongdoing in any of the cases, which come at a time when concerns about the treatment of women have exploded in Congress. Although Farenthold admitted no wrongdoing in Greene's case, he settled the lawsuit out of court in late 2015 for 84,000 - using taxpayer funds that he has recently said he will repay. Despite his pledge, Farenthold has begun to hear murmurs about stepping down, including from fellow Republican Mia Love of Utah. \\"This is about people taking responsibility for what they do and changing the culture in Washington,\\" she said on CNN Thursday. Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland called for Farenthold's resignation Friday. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, also said on Fox News Friday that Farenthold should resign if an ethics investigation finds that sexual misconduct accusations against him have merit. Three other members of Congress have announced plans to quit this week in response to sexual harassment allegations: Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, and Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, a Republican. Despite Farenthold's decision to pay the settlement with his own money, he still has maintained that he did nothing wrong and that Greene was fired for \\"poor performance.\\" Greene's lawyer, meanwhile, said Friday that she has agreed for the first time to fully cooperate with the House Ethics Committee, which reopened an investigation this week into her 2014 complaint. Until now, Greene had sought to avoid working with the panel, saying she wanted to get on with her life after her 2015 confidential settlement with Farenthold. SCATHING: Internet goes wild with Sen. Al Franken resignation Citing new revelations, the Ethics Committee announced Thursday that it is extending its probe into Greene's original allegations, which have laid dormant in the two years since the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) investigation. Farenthold has relied on the OCE's recommendation that the Ethics Committee drop Greene's case after investigators said in 2015 that they found no \\"substantial reason to believe\\" that the congressman had engaged in any wrongdoing. The Ethics Committee, however, has kept the case open, though not actively under investigation until now. \\"I don't believe the OCE's recommendation not to continue the case was a judgment on the ultimate merits of Ms. Greene's claims,\\" said her Washington lawyer, Les Alderman. One proof of that, he added, is the Ethics panel's decision to take a fresh look at the case. After details of their 84,000 taxpayer-funded settlement came to light last week, both Farenthold and Greene have called for greater public transparency in their dispute. But Farenthold, 55, has since been hit with a new public account from another former spokeswoman, Elizabeth Peace, who left his office last March. Although Peace came to Farenthold's office after Greene had left, she provided a similar account of a hostile and sexualized work environment. Neither accused Farenthold of improper sexual contact. In her lawsuit, Greene, then 27, painted a picture of a socially awkward, hard-drinking, middle-aged man who reportedly had \\"sexual fantasies\\" and \\"wet dreams\\" about her. She also accused his chief of staff, Bob Haueter, of regularly belitting and humiliating her. Peace, a former television news anchor, told the Chronicle in an interview this week that even after Greene had left, Farenthold \\"allowed the hostility in his office to continue. He allowed us to work in a place that was just emotionally damaging, and that should never be allowed in any office.\\" Peace, now 37, said that while Farenthold didn't sexually harass her directly, \\"his comments were inappropriate and his unwillingness to immediately take action to allow us to work in a safe environment is inappropriate.\\" Incidents of abusive behavior were not uncommon, according to another woman, former college intern Olivia de la Peña, who worked in Farenthold's office in the fall of 2015. Peña, now 23, said she experienced no sexually inappropriate behavior in the office, but instead learned to navigate what she called the congressman's \\"anger issues.\\" She said she once received an angry call from Farenthold about a travel mix-up that reduced her and the congressman's scheduler to tears. She said Farenthold later apologized. Asked about Peace's account, Farenthold's office provided a statement recounting that two unnamed women complained separately to the congressman sometime in 2016 about allegedly discriminatory treatment they received in the office, particularly from Haueter. According to Farenthold's office, the first woman brought forward her complaint of inappropriate behavior and gender-based treatment, saying Haueter treated her \\"differently.\\" Then another woman came forward to report that the first woman had herself engaged in \\"inappropriate sexualized commentary in the workplace.\\" The Chronicle has confirmed that the second woman was Peace. The other woman, reached by the Chronicle, declined to confirm her involvement, saying she had \\"nothing to add.\\" In response to the complaints, Farenthold said he brought in an \\"independent investigative team\\" to address the two women's concerns. \\"The investigation resulted in the first complaining employee admitting that her problem with Mr. Haueter was based on a personality conflict, and not any gender bias,\\" Farenthold's current communications director, Stacey Daniels, said in a statement. \\"With regard to the second complaint, the investigators did not find corroboration of the alleged sexualized comments attributed to the complaining employee,\\" Daniels said. Daniels said that the outside investigators determined that \\"there was no evidence of gender bias, or inappropriate sexualized comments by office personnel.\\" Despite that conclusion, she said Farenthold and the entire office staff took sensitivity and anti-harassment training to ensure \\"full compliance with office policy and the law.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — When Lauren Greene, a former communications director for Representative Blake Farenthold, sued him claiming sexual harassment, among her complaints was that he “disclosed that a female lobbyist had propositioned him for ‘a threesome.’” Mr. Farenthold, in legal documents, said that Ms. Greene had it wrong. The woman wasn’t a lobbyist, he said. As allegations of sexual misconduct rock Capitol Hill — three lawmakers announced their resignations last week alone — Mr. Farenthold, Republican of Texas, stands out as the survivor. He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago, paid out an 84,000 settlement, financed by taxpayers, and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation. A peek into the inner workings of his office reveals the kind of hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo, that prompted Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, to call Congress “the worst” place for women to work. |||||","completion":"US Representative Blake Farenthold continues to campaign for re-election in the face of multiple allegations of sexual harassment and the use of 84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a lawsuit in the past.

Translate this to English?","completion":"A balanced policy, where on one hand Iran is pressured to respect democratic freedoms and human rights while monitoring its implementation, and on the other hand encouraging Iran to develop relations with the European Union, is the only viable way to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and end mutual competition as well as abandon unilateral strategic approaches to solving the region's problems. In order to achieve a more peaceful and stable geopolitical situation in the region, it is essential to have a balanced and comprehensive policy in place. This includes pressuring Iran to comply with international norms and rules, particularly in terms of democratic freedoms and human rights. Ensuring that Iran respects these norms and standards leads to the reinforcement of its democratic institutions and the empowerment of its civil society, both of which are crucial for the long-term stability of the country. At the same time, it is also important to encourage Iran to foster closer ties with the European Union. By deepening its relationship with the EU, Iran can benefit from increased economic, political, and cultural cooperation, which can help bolster its development efforts and improve the stability of its political system. Furthermore, engaging with Iran in a constructive and collaborative manner, rather than adopting an antagonistic or hostile approach, can help promote understanding and mutual trust between Iran and other countries in the region. Monitoring the progress of Iran's commitments to democratic freedoms and human rights is an important aspect of this policy. It is essential to establish a transparent and comprehensive monitoring mechanism to ensure that Iran is held accountable for its actions, as well as to report on any progress that is made in these areas. This can help maintain pressure on Iran to continue making positive reforms, while also providing valuable information to the international community on Iran's commitments to democracy and human rights. Abandoning unilateral strategic approaches to solving the region's problems is another critical component of this policy. This means that countries should avoid adopting policies that ignore the needs, perspectives, and interests of other key regional players, and instead work towards common goals and objectives. Unilateral actions often result in further tensions and hostilities, whereas cooperation and dialogue can lead to peaceful and lasting solutions to conflicts and disputes in the region. In conclusion, a balanced policy that pressures Iran to respect democratic freedoms and human rights while encouraging it to develop closer ties with the EU, and monitoring the implementation of its commitments, is the most effective way to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and end mutual competition in the region. Furthermore, abandoning unilateral strategic approaches and fostering cooperation and dialogue among all relevant stakeholders is crucial for achieving long-term peace and stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Last Splash was successful in various countries worldwide, and the group toured extensively and played at Lollapalooza 1994. In November 1994, Kelley Deal was arrested on drug-related charges, and in 1995, Wiggs left to pursue other musical projects. Macpherson continued playing with Kim Deal in her side-project group, the Amps, and then in the 1996 incarnation of the Breeders, but quit the band in 1997. The Breeders' lineups for their albums Title TK (2002) and Mountain Battles (2008) included the Deal sisters, Mando Lopez, and Jose Medeles. In 2013, Wiggs and Macpherson rejoined the Deals to tour the 20th anniversary of Last Splash—the LSXX Tour.On December 31, 2013, the Breeders performed their final concert on the 60-date tour in Austin, Texas.

Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand.

Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. Gaelic Ireland was involved in trade with Britain and mainland Europe from ancient times, and this trade increased over the centuries. Tacitus, for example, wrote in the 1st century that most of Ireland's harbours were known to the Romans through commerce. There are many passages in early Irish literature that mention luxury items imported from foreign lands, and the fair of Carman in Leinster included a market of foreign traders. In the Middle Ages the main exports were textiles such as wool and linen while the main imports were luxury items. Money was seldom used in Gaelic society; instead, goods and services were usually exchanged for other goods and services. The economy was mainly a pastoral one, based on livestock (cows, sheep, pigs, goats, etc.) and their products. Cattle was \\"the main element in the Irish pastoral economy\\" and the main form of wealth, providing milk, butter, cheese, meat, fat, hides, and so forth. They were a \\"highly mobile form of wealth and economic resource which could be quickly and easily moved to a safer locality in time of war or trouble\\". The nobility owned great herds of cattle that had herdsmen and guards. Sheep, goats and pigs were also a valuable resource but had a lesser role in Irish pastoralism. Horticulture was practised; the main crops being oats, wheat and barley, although flax was also grown for making linen. Transhumance was also practised, whereby people moved with their livestock to higher pastures in summer and back to lower pastures in the cooler months. The summer pasture was called the buaile (anglicized as booley) and it is noteworthy that the Irish word for boy (buachaill) originally meant a herdsman. Many moorland areas were \\"shared as a common summer pasturage by the people of a whole parish or barony\\".

Article:An arrest warrant was issued for Iraq's most senior Sunni Arab politician on Monday on terrorism charges. Mr Hashemi denies the charges and his entire political bloc is boycotting parliament and the cabinet. Tensions between Sunnis and the Shia Arab majority appear to be coming to a head, a BBC correspondent says. Mr Hashemi is currently in Irbil, under the protection of the Kurdistan regional government. The warrant was issued a day after US troops pulled out of Iraq. US Vice-President Joe Biden has urged Iraqi leaders to work together to avert renewed sectarian strife. By Jim MuirBBC News Among the Iraqis, the Kurds alone can mediate between the country's feuding Sunni and Shia Arab leaders. They are bound to renew that key role in the coming days of intense efforts to revive - or perhaps revise - the national entente formula. In recent years, the Americans would have been expected to head off such a rift long before it happened. The White House has said it is deeply concerned by the current crisis and has been in touch with all sides. Its ability to continue playing a major role in the Iraqi political arena in the post-withdrawal period is thus faced with an immediate test, but the Iraqi perception is that US influence is now much diminished. The crisis may also give clues as to how hard Tehran will seek to push its advantage and exploit the perceived vacuum left by the American withdrawal. Rift endangers unity government Mr Maliki, a Shia Arab, said on live TV that he would dismiss ministers belonging to Mr Hashemi's bloc, al-Iraqiyya, if they did not lift their boycott. He invited all political factions to hold talks to try to resolve the crisis. Otherwise, he said, Iraq could in future have a majority government which any person or bloc would be welcome to join to \\"take the country forward in a positive direction\\". In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, al-Iraqiyya rejected the invitation to talks, saying Mr Maliki himself was \\"the main reason for the crisis and the problem\\". Asked about Mr Hashemi's call for the Arab League to oversee any investigation into the allegations, Mr Maliki said this was a criminal issue in Iraq. He saw no reason why the Arab League or the UN should intervene in an Iraqi criminal case, he said. \\"We do not accept any interference in Iraqi justice,\\" he added. \\"We gave Saddam a fair trial, and we will give Hashemi a fair trial too.\\" Mr Hashemi denies allegations that he funded attacks on government and security officials during Iraq's bloody insurgency. On Monday evening, Iraqi television showed purported confessions from his bodyguards, but the vice-president says that they were false and \\"politicised\\". He told reporters in Irbil on Tuesday: \\"I swear to God that I never committed a sin when it comes to Iraqi blood.\\" He said he would be willing to face trial in Kurdistan. Mr Maliki went on TV after speaking on the phone to Mr Biden. The US vice-president \\"stressed the urgent need for the prime minister and the leaders of the other major blocs to meet and work through their differences together\\", the White House said. Mr Maliki leads a government of national unity in a fragile power-sharing deal that has lasted a year. Iraq has a majority Shia population, but the areas adjacent to the Syrian border are almost entirely Sunni-dominated. BBC Middle East correspondent Jim Muir says Sunni-majority provinces which had previously shown little interest in setting up Kurdistan-style autonomous areas have begun to embrace that idea. This worries the prime minister, who fears an alliance between Sunni areas of Iraq and a possible future Sunni-controlled Syria, should the government of Bashar al-Assad fall, our correspondent adds.

Banned: David Bradley, 55, cannot teach for at least two years after he. admitted streaking across a field with a group of year 8 pupils (file picture) A grammar school teacher who streaked naked in front of his pupils has been banned from Britain's classrooms for at least two years. Education Secretary Michael Gove imposed the sanction on David Bradley, 59, after a disciplinary panel found him guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while working at North Cestrian Grammar School, in Altrincham, Cheshire. Bradley, who received an MBE four years. ago for his work with children on the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, quit his job last month after admitting it had been. ‘inappropriate’ to streak. He had been camping with the group of 12-and 13-year-olds on a field trip when he agreed to run naked across a garden. The married teacher told a disciplinary panel: ‘The lads had streaked for a joke and they were saying, “Come on sir, you have a go.” ‘At that point, for whatever reason, I got up, ran down the garden and ran back in. Even when I did it I thought, “What am I doing?”’ The Teaching Agency, who announced the ban today said: 'We are satisfied on the evidence that he took the conscious decision to agree to streak, then moved out of his sleeping bag, removed his boxer shorts and then ran with pupils in the garden. Bradley said that he could not explain why he had behaved in that way, but claimed that in November 2011 he was close to a breakdown due to stress and the pressure of work. Their report went on: 'Mr Bradley confirmed that there were no complaints raised by any children, and the children had found it hilarious.' Recommending he should be struck off the disciplinary panel said: 'Teachers are expected to behave in a manner which ensures the maintenance of appropriate professional boundaries. 'We believe that your actions in engaging in the streak failed to maintain the clear boundaries and appropriate delineation of behaviour which should exist between pupils and teachers. Your behaviour failed to ensure the maintenance of appropriate boundaries which are essential in order to ensure that a teacher's position of trust, responsibility and authority are upheld.' Bradley had undressed in an area where children were showering during the school camping trip to the Solwaybank centre in Dumfries and Galloway in November 2011. The veteran teacher, from Hale Barns in Greater Manchester, was also accused of inappropriately hugging a female pupil from North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham, Cheshire, where he taught. However, the Teaching Agency hearing in Coventry ruled that undressing in front of boys while they showered and hugging the girl, who Bradley said was hypothermic, did not amount to misconduct. Respected: Four years ago Mr Bradley was handed an MBE but has now left North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham in disgrace after the school trip. The English master was awarded an MBE in 2008 for services. to young people after running schemes for the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award. for 30 years. He said at the time that organising. trips was ‘normally just an excuse to have fun and enjoy the animal. vitality the young exude’. Bradley, who has taught for 37 years, said he realised while streaking that what he was doing was unprofessional. However, referring to the accusations. about hugging the girl, Bradley said he was ‘aghast’ that what used to. be considered normal behaviour for teachers could now cause complaints. ‘The thing that comes out of this is how out of date I am,’ he said. ‘What is viewed as normal today seems. to have gone to a frightening situation where an adult can’t be near to. a child without being accused of something. I’m aghast.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In February 2013, David Bradley, a 59-year-old grammar school teacher, was banned from teaching in Britain for at least two years after streaking naked in front of his pupils during a school camping trip to the Solwaybank center in Dumfries and Galloway in November 2011.

The breakdown of igneous rocks and the cooling of lava are two separate processes. The breakdown of igneous rocks usually occurs due to weathering and erosion, while the cooling of lava happens when molten rock, or magma, reaches the Earth's surface and loses heat to the atmosphere. However, if we consider the broader context, the breakdown of igneous rocks contributes to the production of soil and sediment. This sediment can be carried by rivers and other geological processes to different areas, potentially affecting the landscape. These changes in the landscape could, in turn, influence local geological conditions and processes like tectonic activity or magma formation, but this would occur over a very long timescale and would not directly influence the cooling of lava."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the below context: Rachmaninoff's choral symphony The Bells reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem. Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces.

The star — which only has the scientific designation of EBLM J0555-57Ab — is located about 600 light-years from Earth and can be seen from the Southern Hemisphere — if you look through a large telescope. \\"I was a little surprised to find one this small,\\" Amaury Triaud, co-author of the paper published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics on Wednesday, told CBC News. Astronomers searching for exoplanets, which orbit other stars, came across the star in one of their surveys. This is part of the team that discovered the TRAPPIST-1 system, another small and dim star that has seven planets, three of which hold the best chance for finding life outside our solar system, something that Triaud, who is a senior researcher at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, still believes to be true. An artist's illustration of the seven new planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. (European Southern Observatory) The team focuses mainly on exoplanets, using the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) survey, telescopes that look for minute dips in a star's brightness that may indicate a planet is crossing in front of it. But sometimes stars pass in front of another star as part of a two-star system. Astronomers have catalogued 200 of these binary systems using WASP. Initially, the astronomers thought that it was an exoplanet. The star is 2,000 to 3,000 times fainter than our own sun. However, upon collecting more data, they realized that the mass indicated it had to be a tiny, dim star. Astrophysicists believe that starting fusion — where gravity creates high pressure and temperatures that change hydrogen atoms into helium atoms — can only be done at a particular mass. And this new star is massive enough to do that. Extreme close-up The small star is just slightly larger than Saturn, or 80 per cent the size of Jupiter, with a radius of 49,000 kilometres. It also has 85 times the mass of Jupiter: if you could stand on the star, the gravity would be 300 times Earth's. When there are two stars in a system, they orbit around the same spot, called the barycentre. And this newly discovered baby star is so close to its companion — 10 times closer than Mercury is to our sun — that it takes just seven days to orbit the shared barycentre. It's like trying to look at a candle beside a lighthouse. - Amaury Triaud , University of Cambridge In a typical binary system, there is a separation between two stars that is larger than our solar system, Triaud said, somewhere between 100 and 1,000 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the distance between Earth and the sun, about 150 million kilometres). In this case, Triaud noted, it's only eight per cent of an astronomical unit. The star is not only small, it's much cooler than many of the gas giant exoplanets that have been discovered. \\"That star likely represents the smallest natural fusion reactor that we know of,\\" Triaud said. \\"We're trying to replicate fusion on Earth in labs, but that's basically as small as it gets in nature.\\" The mass of this star is much like TRAPPIST-1, but it is 30 per cent smaller. TRAPPIST-1 is about the size of Jupiter, far smaller than our sun. (European Southern Observatory) The astronomers will continue to study the star, where among other things, they will attempt to determine how much light the star emits. It's somewhat difficult to study this dwarf star due to the companion star's brightness. \\"It's like trying to look at a candle beside a lighthouse,\\" Triaud said. The team hopes this will shed some light on some of the most abundant stars in our universe. \\"It shows how many different objects exist in the universe,\\" Triaud said. \\"Most of the stars have the mass less one-quarter that of the sun … although it's a bit on the smaller range, but it's part of the smallest stars that exist, which are the most common stars that exist. And it's odd that we know so little about the most common stars in the universe.\\" ||||| Credit: Amanda Smith The smallest star yet measured has been discovered by a team of astronomers led by the University of Cambridge. With a size just a sliver larger than that of Saturn, the gravitational pull at its stellar surface is about 300 times stronger than what humans feel on Earth. The star is likely as small as stars can possibly become, as it has just enough mass to enable the fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. If it were any smaller, the pressure at the centre of the star would no longer be sufficient to enable this process to take place. Hydrogen fusion is also what powers the Sun, and scientists are attempting to replicate it as a powerful energy source here on Earth. These very small and dim stars are also the best possible candidates for detecting Earth-sized planets which can have liquid water on their surfaces, such as TRAPPIST-1, an ultracool dwarf surrounded by seven temperate Earth-sized worlds. The newly-measured star, called EBLM J0555-57Ab, is located about six hundred light years away. It is part of a binary system, and was identified as it passed in front of its much larger companion, a method which is usually used to detect planets, not stars. Details will be published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. \\"Our discovery reveals how small stars can be,\\" said Alexander Boetticher, the lead author of the study, and a Master's student at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory and Institute of Astronomy. \\"Had this star formed with only a slightly lower mass, the fusion reaction of hydrogen in its core could not be sustained, and the star would instead have transformed into a brown dwarf.\\" EBLM J0555-57Ab was identified by WASP, a planet-finding experiment run by the Universities of Keele, Warwick, Leicester and St Andrews. EBLM J0555-57Ab was detected when it passed in front of, or transited, its larger parent star, forming what is called an eclipsing stellar binary system. The parent star became dimmer in a periodic fashion, the signature of an orbiting object. Thanks to this special configuration, researchers can accurately measure the mass and size of any orbiting companions, in this case a small star. The mass of EBLM J0555-57Ab was established via the Doppler, wobble method, using data from the CORALIE spectrograph. \\"This star is smaller, and likely colder than many of the gas giant exoplanets that have so far been identified,\\" said von Boetticher. \\"While a fascinating feature of stellar physics, it is often harder to measure the size of such dim low-mass stars than for many of the larger planets. Thankfully, we can find these small stars with planet-hunting equipment, when they orbit a larger host star in a binary system. It might sound incredible, but finding a star can at times be harder than finding a planet.\\" This newly-measured star has a mass comparable to the current estimate for TRAPPIST-1, but has a radius that is nearly 30% smaller. \\"The smallest stars provide optimal conditions for the discovery of Earth-like planets, and for the remote exploration of their atmospheres,\\" said co-author Amaury Triaud, senior researcher at Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy. \\"However, before we can study planets, we absolutely need to understand their star; this is fundamental.\\" Although they are the most numerous stars in the Universe, stars with sizes and masses less than 20% that of the Sun are poorly understood, since they are difficult to detect due to their small size and low brightness. The EBLM project, which identified the star in this study, aims to plug that lapse in knowledge. \\"Thanks to the EBLM project, we will achieve a far greater understanding of the planets orbiting the most common stars that exist, planets like those orbiting TRAPPIST-1,\\" said co-author Professor Didier Queloz of Cambridge' Cavendish Laboratory.

'A Saturn-size low-mass star at the hydrogen-burning limit.' Astronomy & Astrophysics (2017). arXiv: arxiv.org/abs/1706.08781 ||||| Astronomers have discovered a star 600 light-years away that stretches the definition of what can even be considered a star. That's because EBLM J0555-57Ab, the smallest star ever discovered, is the size of a planet—specifically, it's just a hair bigger than Saturn. But the star 57Ab is much more massive than Saturn. In fact, it's 85 times the mass of Jupiter, which makes it just massive enough to fuse hydrogen into helium and become a true star. Because of its small radius, though, it was initially caught up in a case of mistaken identity. 57Ab is part of a triple star system. While the sun-mass stars EBLM J0555-57A and EBLM J0555-57B orbit around each other, 57Ab orbits only the primary star. 57Ab's small size in comparison to its sun-like companions led researchers to conclude initially that the planet-sized star was just that, a planet. The star's mistaken classification occurred in part because it was detected by transit—the general method for finding exoplanets—where one body passes in front of another and dims some of the light from the background object. Everything about the light curve suggested a planet. \\"Indeed, until we measured the mass it looked just like a transiting planet,\\" said Amaury Triaud, a Kavli Institute fellow at the University of Cambridge and an author on the paper published today in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Current models suggest a big ball of gas has enough mass to ignite into a star at about 80 times the mass of Jupiter. To be considered a star, an object must undergo nuclear fusion in its core and fuse hydrogen into helium. Below 80 Jupiter masses, star-like objects are called brown dwarfs and only fuse hydrogen into the isotope deuterium. So at 85 Jupiter masses, 57Ab is cutting it close to what can be considered a star. It's less than one percent the mass of the sun, and indeed, Triaud says the team has had trouble determining some information about the star as its light is completely blotted out by its larger companions. It's also likely that 57Ab has always been this way, rather than having lost some of its mass to its host star, EBLM J0555-57A. That still doesn't quite explain how the system came into existence, though. \\"It is not entirely clear how stars with very different masses, like in our case, can form so close to each other,\\" Triaud says. \\"One scenario is that the stars formed further apart and somehow got closer. One way to do that is if they had very eccentric orbits, early on. Tidal forces would then tend to reduce the distance between the stars and make their orbits more circular.\\" The small size of 57Ab places it in a class of stars called ultracool stars. The most famous example is TRAPPIST-1, a Jupiter-sized star that is home to seven planets. (Triaud was part of the team that discovered this system.) They're ideal laboratories for studying planetary systems with giant telescopes—that is, if astronomers can manage to find them. \\"It is a little ironic that those small stars are the most common stars in the cosmos, but because they are faint, we don't as much about them as we wish,\\" Triaud says. \\"This is why, in parallel to our investigations into planets orbiting ultracool stars, we are also investigating the stars themselves.\\" Now that EBLM J0555-57Ab is officially the smallest star ever discovered, you can bet that more astronomers will be turning their telescopes to observe the strange Saturn-sized star and learn more about these mysterious ultracool objects, treading the line between planethood and stardom. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A team of international astronomers has discovered the smallest star known in our galaxy, EBLM J0555-57Ab, which has a radius just slightly larger than Saturn, about 80% the size of Jupiter, and 85 times the mass of Jupiter. Located approximately 600 light-years from Earth, the star can only be seen from the Southern Hemisphere and through a large telescope. Researchers believe the star is massive enough to enable the fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium, a reaction necessary for a natural fusion reactor. The star is part of a binary system; it orbits a much larger companion star. This discovery has shed light on some of the most abundant stars in the universe, increasing our understanding of the smallest stars that exist, which are also the most common stars in the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Direct effect: A lower voltage electrical source will produce a weaker electrical current. Since the strength of the magnetic field is directly proportional to the strength of the electric current, a weaker current will result in a weaker electromagnet. This directly impacts the process of magnetization. Indirect effect: As the strength of the electrical current decreases due to fewer batteries, the rate at which the magnetic field is created around the wire is slowed down. This in turn affects how quickly the metal is magnetized. Additionally, a weaker magnetic field may not be as effective in certain applications, such as in lifting heavy objects or for use in electromechanical devices, which could indirectly impact the overall effectiveness of the electromagnet in its intended application."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Today, we are going to talk about how to choose the best name for a horse. Now, you must be wondering why it's essential to give our horse friends a great name. Well, just like we have names that make us unique, our horse friends need names too. A good name can make a horse feel special, and, most importantly, helps us cheer for them when they race. So, let's learn how to pick an excellent horse name together! 1. Keep it short and sweet: The most important rule to remember when naming your horse is not to choose a name that is too long. Imagine trying to shout a name that's 18 letters long! That would be a struggle, right? So, pick a name that is easy to say and fun to yell out loud when cheering your horse on! 2. Be kind and respectful: We should always be polite and considerate to everyone, including our horse friends. So, we should avoid picking names that may hurt someone's feelings or be offensive. If you are unsure about a name, ask your parents or friends what they think, and remember that choosing a kind name is always best! 3. Stay away from some name categories: Sometimes, there are specific name categories we should avoid when naming our horse. For example, instead of picking names of historic victors (famous winners from the past), we can think of a new, creative name that will make our horse stand out. This way, our horse will have a unique and wonderful name we can be proud of! 4. Imagine cheering loudly: Your horse may participate in races, and, as we all know, races can be super exciting! So, when choosing a horse name, imagine shouting that name with hundreds of adoring fans all around you. If the name sounds great and complements the excitement, then congratulations! You've found the perfect name! 5. Be ready to explain the name: Lastly, our horse's name can be a head-turner, and people may wonder about its meaning. So, if the name is not easily understood, be prepared to explain why you chose it. For example, if you named your horse \\"Lightning Bolt\\" because of its incredible speed, tell people about it! They'll love to hear the exciting story behind the name. That's it, little friends! Remember these helpful tips when naming your horse, and have lots of fun doing it. The perfect name will make your horse feel loved and special, and that's what we all want for our animal friends.

Write highlights for this article: When was the last time you looked at the label on your clothes to check where they were made or what they are made of? A few years ago, I was living a paradox familiar to many Americans: eating local and organic food, carrying reusable bags to the grocery store and choosing eco-friendly products wherever I could. This mindfulness was in no way extended to my closet -- I owned more than 350 items of clothes, every single bit of it cheap, trendy, poorly made and assembled in low-wage factories in other countries. See the lifecycle of your cotton T-shirt. Fashion today has a here-today-gone-tomorrow mentality, where the latest look, lowest price or the hottest designer are paramount and quantity is valued over quality. For the first time in history, we are consuming clothes as a disposable good, buying a cheap dress for a date night and wearing it but once or twice. These changing attitudes prompted me to write my book, \\"Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion,\\" and what I learned about the fashion industry during the process compelled me to change. Complete coverage: Fashion Week. Our consumption of clothing is growing at an alarming rate. Most Americans have closets brimming, if not overflowing with clothes. Few of those purchases are made here -- 3% of apparel is produced in the United States, down from about half in 1990. While American factories sit empty, our thirst for cheap imported clothing has kept the cash registers at many stores humming throughout the recession. Fashion's environmental footprint has also mushroomed. There are more than 80 billion garments produced around the world today, and according to a study by the UK's Cambridge University, the industry is creating 70 million tons of waste water as of 2006 in the UK alone. In China, the largest clothing manufacturer in the world, the textile industry is also a major polluter. Last year, I traveled undercover to southern China and saw smog enshrouding a landscape of factories and, more shockingly, hundreds of factory workers wearing cheap, trendy clothes. As China's consumer class grows, already-scarce resources like water and petroleum may soon buckle under all of this shopping. In July, when it came out that the Olympic uniforms were made in China, Americans were outraged, making it clear that we're growing weary of soulless consumption. I believe we're ready for more meaningful wardrobes, and to support our amazing clothing heritage. My mother recently gave me a dress that she wore in high school in the 1960s. It was made by Jonathan Logan, a juniors brand that was considered cheap for its day -- the dress is 100% wool, fully lined, finished with French seams and made in the USA. What's so wonderful about locally made fashion is that it offers designers tight control over their product, has a lower environmental footprint and makes it easier to keep an eye on any labor problems. And according to a Cotton Incorporated Lifestyle Monitor survey, approximately 55% of consumers agree it is \\"very/somewhat important\\" that their clothing is made in the U.S. I was recently in Portland, Oregon, and met with the owners of Spooltown and the Portland Garment Factory, two small shops that have opened recently in a city that had very little existing garment industry infrastructure. They were able to build profitable manufacturing businesses from scratch. Just imagine what other Americans cities could do with the right government and consumer support. Major fashion brands also have an obligation to dramatically reduce the amount of water and energy used and waste emitted in making and selling their clothes, as well as to offer consumers more stylish products that are made out of recycled and eco-friendly materials. Nike is creating athletic team uniforms out of recycled PET bottles and has recycled more than 28 million pairs of athletic shoes through their Reuse-a-Shoe program; Eileen Fisher has just released a beautiful line of bluesign-certified silk shirts dyed without hazardous chemicals; and H&M has agreed to stop using toxic and nonbiodegradable perfluorinated compounds, called PFCs, in their outerwear by 2013. These efforts need to be expanded. Clothing designers also need to rethink the materials they're using and how they're sourced. Fortunately, eco-friendly textiles have improved so much in recent years that luxurious eco-friendly fibers like Tencel, Modal and Cupro have far more in common with silk than a hemp sack. Some emerging designers are eschewing new textiles altogether for upcycling, which means taking waste and reclaimed textile material and turning it into a product with higher value. I recently bought a lovely red tunic upcycled from a men's dress shirt produced by a small Brooklyn designer called State. Designer on the rise: Mohapatra's moment. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, we are throwing away 68 pounds of textiles per person per year and donating such a staggering volume of clothes that a majority of our donations to charity have to be sold to textile recyclers who then sell more than half of our used clothes overseas, largely to Africa. Retailers like Eileen Fisher and Patagonia are accepting returns of their worn products -- Fisher resells them in her Green Eileen retail store, while Patagonia recycles theirs into new products. Fast-fashion stores need to start these types of recycling programs. Consumers can also take more responsibility by repairing and caring for the clothes they own, trading their duds at clothing swaps and, for the particularly creative, refashioning last year's styles into fresh looks. Now for the million-dollar question: How can you afford this? It all starts by taking an honest look at how you're spending money on clothes. The average American consumer spends 1,700 a year on apparel. Most of us own more clothing than we know what to do with, so I encourage people to first of all buy less clothing and to try to limit trendy, throwaway purchases to only one or two a season. Divert the rest of your clothing budget to clothes that you truly love and are going to wear for several seasons. If just a quarter of our purchases were put toward locally made or eco-friendly fashion and fashion companies with a commitment to sustainability, we could change the face of the industry. I also believe we'd be happier with our clothes. See what a cotton T-shirt goes through before it gets to you. Is your closet filled with cheap, disposable clothing? Do you think it's worth changing how you shop? Share your thoughts in the comments section below. The opinions in this story are solely those of Elizabeth Cline. Highlights:","completion":"1. Many people buy lots of cheap clothes and don't think about where they are made or what they are made of. 2. Clothes today are used like disposable things, we buy them, wear them once or twice, and then throw them away. 3. A lot of clothes are made in countries with low wages and have a big impact on the environment. 4. There are changes happening in the fashion industry to make clothes in a more eco-friendly way. 5. We can all help by buying less clothes, choosing quality over quantity, and supporting clothes made in a better way."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
