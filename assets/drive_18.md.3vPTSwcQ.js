Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Australian scientists say an organic compound used by Indian women to paint dots or bindi on their foreheads could hold the key to a breakthrough in cancer treatment. Rose Bengal was first used in the early 1900s as a dye for food, textiles and cosmetics. But now it is proving to be a useful weapon in the fight against skin cancer. Television advertisements constantly warn of the dangers of overexposure to the fierce sun. Among them is the possibility of the disease melanoma , a type of skin cancer. More than 1,200 Australians die every year from the disease. Initial trials of a solution of Rose Bengal injected into some melanoma cells have had a 75 percent success rate in controlling the disease. Professor John Thompson, the director of the Melanoma Unit at the University of Sydney, says this organic dye could become a powerful cancer-fighting treatment. \\"We believe it works by getting into the tumor cells and causing them to self-destruct. But the exact mechanism by which it works is not totally clear. It's not useful for people who have a primary melanoma. The treatment of primary melanoma is surgical excision ,\\"he said. \\"It's useful to inject tumors for people who have recurrences; when the primary treatment has failed and when recurrence in the area, or at more distant sites has occurred.\\" About 90 percent of Australians who develop melanoma survive thanks to early diagnosis and treatment. If left untreated, however, the disease can be fatal. Convincing younger people in Australia about the dangers of overexposure to the sun is a battle campaigners are constantly waging. Veronica Manock, a 21-year-old student, had two major operations to remove a cancerous tumor from her leg. \\"I've had a lot of friends who just said 'I thought it was just, you know, I'll get a mole cut out and that's it', whereas I don't think people realize how much danger they're putting themselves into and how easy it is to stop something like this happening to you just from doing little things,\\"said Marock.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write a summary based on this article: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is riding high this week. But politics is a fickle business, Americans have short memories, and every race is different. On the latter point, as Sen. Marco Rubio (who was on top just a year ago) told CNN's Dana Bash, \\"I think we need to understand that some of these races don't apply to future races. Every race is different — it has a different set of factors — but I congratulate (Christie) on his win.\\" Some will say this is a less-than-gracious congratulations. Maybe. But it's also true. There is a danger in winning, inasmuch as it fosters hubris and often reinforces the wrong lessons. Ken Cuccinelli, for example, won a series of down-ballot elections despite being outspent and having a penchant for micro-managing. He always won — until he didn't. When we win, we have a tendency to think it's because we did everything right. In this regard, winning a landslide election can be especially dangerous. Losers may have to re-evaluate things — but not winners. For this reason, winning can ironically reinforce bad habits and make a candidate less likely to engage in introspection, or even be open to constructive criticism. It must feel good to believe you've finally cracked the code. But this is a trap. As Cuccinelli just learned, what works in a state Senate race may not work in a governor's race. And as Christie may soon learn, what works in a governor's race may not work on a presidential race (just ask Rick Perry). For Christie right now, the champagne is still flowing, and laudatory notes and calls and columns are still coming in. So if you're Chris Christie, you probably think a couple things are true. You think that through the shear force of your personality, you can make people like you. And you probably believe that you can get away with being confrontational. You might even think this is a selling point. You think this because — so far — it's held true. So far, Christie's confrontational style has mostly come across as refreshing. (Perhaps we secretly enjoy getting to yell at people vicariously through him?) And in a primary contest where conservatives are looking for a fighter, this might actually help him. So many of us already conflate anger and passion with a conservative philosophy. Christie may also benefit from a style that is an obvious contrast to the cerebral and aloof Obama. On the other hand, as Jonathan Chait has noted, while attacking teachers or Obama might help in a primary, \\"It's another thing altogether if he gives this treatment to Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan, Scott Walker, or other fellow partisans.\\" But let's just assume, for the sake of argument, that Christie makes it to the general election. Imagine a time after the press has turned on him (as they turned on John McCain and other Republican media darlings). What happens when MSNBC plays video of him yelling at someone for the millionth time, and after George Will or Charles Krauthammer writes the column about the danger of an angry man having his finger on the button? What happens when he tells a national political reporter that \\"it's none of your business\\"? How will that play in Peoria — under the intense glare of a presidential campaign? Not everyone thinks this is a problem. \\"Christie's confrontational personality can appeal to all sorts of electorates so long as he trains his anger in the right places,\\" writes Josh Barro, who believes the \\"right places\\" include New Jersey teachers, because \\"Christie's ire toward groups that demand ever-higher taxes and spending is popular with the electorate.\\" But as Scott Galupo points out, other interest groups Christie might encounter on the presidential trail won't make for such easy marks: Is Chris Christie going to yell at senior citizens about Medicare? Is he going to yell at beneficiaries of food stamps? Is he going to yell at families on Medicaid or CHIP? Is he going to yell at farmers about agribusiness subsidies? [The American Conservative] The problem isn't just that Christie's style won't always work on the presidential trail. It's that it might backfire ... horribly. It's understandable why his advisors might not want him to tinker with his natural demeanor. And you can imagine the \\"let Christie be Christie\\" headlines that would surely emerge were he to tone down his style and fall flat. But conservatives who have seen the media turn on Republicans once they become a viable threat to a Democrat like Hillary Clinton worry his behavior will gradually go from being portrayed as \\"colorful\\" or charming to erratic and dangerous. \\"If Christie yells at a teacher at a town hall in Iowa, that teacher is going to get a lot of time on television afterward — in a way that these people [who] get berated in New Jersey don't,\\" says my liberal sparring partner Bill Scher. This is a good point. In recent years, we've seen \\"civilians\\" like Joe the Plumber and Sandra Fluke elevated to rock star status. One can easily imagine Christie telling some teacher in Davenport to 'Do your job!' But what happens when she goes on to become a cause célèbre? The media would then parade this \\"victim\\" around as an excuse to talk about Christie's \\"bullying\\" and Christie's \\"war on women.\\" If I were Hillary, I would set a trap. Just send female supporters in to every Christie coffee, rally, or speech in New Hampshire or Iowa — and have them confront him on camera. What would he do? How long before he snaps at one of them? You can watch Bill Scher and I discuss this on Bloggingheads below: ||||| All signs point to Gov. Chris Christie cruising to reelection in New Jersey tonight. This is one of those times when personal bias is well nigh overwhelming: Christie—an authentic, half-Italian, New Jerseyan Bruce Springsteen uberfanatic, and a strong conservative by any reasonable standard—is about to rocket to the top tier of 2016 presidential contenders. Judging by a spate of recent posts and on-the-ground reports, Business Insider’s Josh Barro is an unabashed fan of Christie as well. He even brushes aside the one serious reservation I have about the governor: his proclivity for in-your-face confrontations—in a word, “bullying”: Christie’s confrontational personality can appeal to all sorts of electorates so long as he trains his anger in the right places. When Christie yelled at that teacher yesterday about how education spending levels will “never be enough” for New Jersey’s teachers’ unions, he was doing so in a state that spent 19,291 per pupil on K-12 education last year — more than any state except New York and Vermont and 74% more than the national average. … So long as Christie keeps training his anger in the right place, Christie will be O.K. What national liberal reporters don’t get is that “towards teachers” can be the right place, politically and substantively, to train that anger. This is true as far as it goes. Which I fear is not actually very far. Back in 2010, I wrote this at U.S. News: In the short term, the example of New Jersey’s Gov. Chris Christie is instructive. He has maintained popularity while aggressively pushing an agenda of fiscal austerity. How does he do it? Simple: In teachers unions and state-government employees, Christie has found a juicy, isolatable adversary. This works on the state level, where things like pensions and teacher benefits are significant sources of budget shortfalls—unlike on the national level, where middle-class entitlements are the big driver. The lesson is this: To the extent that “government” is a sectional entity—an interest group consisting of people who have not had to “sacrifice like the rest of us”—Republicans will find that cutting it is politically popular. To that extent that “government” is Grandma and Grandpa in Boca Raton, Republicans will need to tread carefully and—it’s possible to do both—honestly. Zoom in on “juicy, isolatable adversary.” At the presidential level, teachers aren’t going to cut it. Neither are employees of the federal government, whose salaries account for about 5 percent of total federal spending. Is Chris Christie going to yell at senior citizens about Medicare? Is he going to yell at beneficiaries of food stamps? Is he going to yell at families on Medicaid or CHIP? Is he going to yell at farmers about agribusiness subsidies? If Christie is a wise and disciplined campaigner, I find it hard to believe he’d do any of those things. And given his recent disparagement of the GOP’s “libertarian strain” in the context of the debate over the national security state, I can’t see Christie getting up in the grill of a Pentagon contractor, either. Teachers and public-sector employees who don’t want to pay as much for their healthcare as most of the rest of us do are the “right targets” when you’re arguing about state budgets. In fact, they are ridiculously easy targets. They are to Chris Christie what southern reactionaries are to Sacha Baron Cohen. But I ask Josh: who are the analogously easy marks when you’re talking about the federal budget, and do you honestly think it will do Chris Christie any good to get in their faces? ||||| Summary:","completion":"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's confrontational style has been perceived as refreshing, but it could be a double-edged sword as he moves towards a potential presidential run. While it may help him in a primary contest where conservatives are looking for a fighter, the media might turn on him once he becomes a viable threat to a Democrat like Hillary Clinton, changing the portrayal of his behavior from charming to erratic and dangerous. Christie's advisors may not want him to change his natural demeanor, but they should be cautious of the potential pitfalls of his approach, especially in engaging with different interest groups on the presidential trail."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral.... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who has thirty-seven individual panels attributed to him with confidence?

He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history. But I can use this background: Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since: What is an answer for this question: Which era would more likely be shorter, era A or era B?","completion":"Based on the information provided, era B would more likely be shorter. Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Era A represents the time when dinosaurs were flourishing, before their extinction around 66 million years ago. This implies a long period of evolutionary processes leading to the diversity and dominance of dinosaurs. 2. Era B represents the time period of a mass extinction event. These events, while devastating in their impact on biodiversity, are relatively brief in comparison to processes of evolution and species dominance. 3. The event that marks the transition from era A to era B is classified as a \\"mass extinction event\\". From the background provided, mass extinctions often represent accumulations of smaller extinction-events that occur in a brief period of time in comparison to periods of evolutionary development and diversity, like era A. 4. This comparable briefness is further supported by the fact that even the first known mass extinction event, the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago, is prescribed as an \\"event\\", suggesting a shorter duration relative to the long stretches of time between such events. Therefore, based on the idea that evolutionary processes take much longer than mass extinction events, era B would typically be shorter than era A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term \\"Xizang\\" was first used during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368). To provide a more detailed history and context, the Yuan Dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, who extended his Mongol Empire by successfully conquering the Song Dynasty in China. The Yuan Dynasty represents the first time in history when the whole of China was under foreign rule. During the early part of the Yuan Dynasty, Tibet was officially incorporated as a part of the empire. Prior to this, Tibet was not uniformly defined or had stable political boundaries. Rather, it was a diverse region consisting of several smaller kingdoms and principalities. In the 13th century, Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyeltsen, an important Tibetan religious leader, established a relationship with the Mongol court, which ultimately led to Tibetan submission under the rule of the Yuan Dynasty. With this development, Tibet became an important cultural and religious hub within the Yuan Empire. The term \\"Xizang\\" originated in this historical context, as the ruling Mongols and the Chinese administrative system sought to establish a clear identity for this newly incorporated territory. \\"Xizang\\" is comprised of two Chinese characters, \\"Xi\\" (Chinese: 西), which means \\"west,\\" and \\"Zang\\" (Chinese: 藏), which is associated with the Tibetan people, their language, and their culture. The combined term Xizang was thus a geographic description of the region within the Yuan Empire, referring to the \\"western part of the Tibetan area.\\" In conclusion, the term \\"Xizang\\" was first used during the Yuan Dynasty when Tibet was officially incorporated into its empire. It was a geographical expression referring to the territory inhabited by Tibetan people, language, and culture in the western part of the Yuan realm."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given inputs k, i, and A, where k and i are integers and A is a list.

Summarize: It is the first industrial action of its kind in the offshore oil and gas industry in almost 30 years. But how do you actually conduct a strike on a North Sea oil platform? Those union members involved on the seven Shell platforms will go to designated areas - but will respond should there be an emergency situation. There will not be the traditional high-profile picket lines that people associate with strikes on land. In February, Wood Group announced it was cutting rates paid to about a third of its UK contractor workforce. It blamed the \\"continuing cost and efficiency challenges affecting the UK North Sea oil and gas sector\\". The unions claim workers could suffer a cut to their pay and allowances of up to 30% - but that has been dismissed by Wood Group. Workers are also disgruntled that a two-week working cycle has been changed to a three-week cycle. leaving many away from their families for a longer time. An overtime ban came into effect on Monday ahead of the planned Tuesday strike. It was expected to go ahead as there were no fresh talks on Monday. RMT regional organiser Jake Molloy told the BBC Scotland news website: \\"Striking on an offshore installation is a unique exercise which has no comparison with any other industrial sector. \\"There's no collective grouping in the form of mass meetings, no 'march through the gates' or establishing a picket line, and there's no place and little point to waving flags or displaying placards - as there's nobody there to see them. \\"Instead of turning out to work at 6:30 tomorrow morning workers will turn out to gather in an assigned area on the platform, probably a games room, cinema or meeting room. \\"This room and any other assigned will be their area for the duration of their work period, 12 hours, after which they can return to their cabins. \\"I expect they will have organised activities to get them through the day as they know it is a long day when you're not working.\\" Mr Molloy said the strikers would be passing the time with card games and quizzes, plus reading the messages of support from across the North Sea and beyond. But he recognised that it could be difficult for those not involved in the dispute who are continuing to work. Nevertheless, Mr Molloy hoped there would be \\"good banter and camaraderie\\" amongst the workforce as a whole. He believed it took great courage to get involved in any form of industrial action offshore. Mr Molloy explained: \\"This is an unforgiving industry with a seriously bad record when it comes to any form of workforce challenge, these workers are to be applauded for their strength, spirit and principles.\\" Unite regional officer John Boland echoed the words of the RMT regional organiser, saying strike action was not a decision taken lightly. He added: \\"There have been ongoing discussions between our shop stewards and the management on the actual platforms. \\"It's been arranged [there will be] designated areas where our members will go while they are taking industrial action. \\"Obviously this is a safety issue as well, so they are in areas which are safe for them. \\"But also we have said to Shell and Wood Group that in the case of an unforeseen emergency happening then any of our members who are members of emergency response teams will respond. \\"They are in an area where they can be contacted if necessary.\\" Oil services firm Wood Group said it was \\"extremely disappointed\\" by the decision to take strike action. Dave Stewart, chief executive officer for Wood Group's eastern region business unit, said: \\"Our employees' safety and wellbeing remains our top priority and our commitment is to ensuring it is not compromised during industrial action. \\"Although we are extremely disappointed that industrial action will be taken, we respect the right of those employees who choose to do so. \\"Our firm focus remains on reaching a resolution, which meets our mutual goal of sustaining these jobs for our employees in the North Sea now and in the future, against the backdrop of an extremely challenging climate created by the sustained low oil price. \\"We are continuing to engage frequently, proactively and openly with our employees and the unions. We met with union representatives on Friday and senior management have visited impacted installations over the weekend to talk with our people, with the clear aim of positively progressing discussions towards reaching a resolution.\\" A Shell spokesman said: \\"This action is highly regrettable. Shell's priority is to ensure the safety of our workforce and assets and we will not compromise on safety during this period of industrial action. \\"While we recognise the right of Wood Group's employees to strike, it is clear that in order for the North Sea oil and gas industry to remain competitive in the lower oil price environment, structural change is needed. \\"We hope that Wood Group's employees and management will continue working towards reaching a solution which will halt this counter-productive industrial action.\\" Wood Group provides maintenance and construction services to the installations, having signed a new three-year contract extension with Shell earlier this year. The seven Shell platforms involved are Shearwater, Gannet, Nelson, Curlew, Brent Alpha, Brent Bravo and Brent Charlie. Summary:","completion":"Workers on seven Shell oil platforms in the North Sea are conducting the first strike in their industry for almost 30 years. The industrial action, in response to the announcement by Wood Group in February that it would be cutting rates paid to around a third of its UK contractor workforce, comes in response to fears that workers could see their pay and allowances cut by as much as 30%.

Write a title for this article: When Mariano Rivera is on the mound, as he was in the ninth inning yesterday at Yankee Stadium, he insists he feels fine. His arm feels normal, he said, and he does not think about pain. It is after he pitches that Rivera feels something different. That is why he took a magnetic resonance imaging exam before reporting to the ballpark yesterday. Rivera wanted peace of mind, and he said he had it now. “When your arm hurts, you want to know what’s going on with your arm,” Rivera said. “Now that I know there’s nothing wrong, it’s just a small strain, I can deal with it.” Rivera has a mild muscle strain in his right elbow, and Manager Joe Torre said he would no longer be tempted to use him in the eighth inning. But the ninth is fair game, and Rivera secured the final three outs in a 6-4 victory over the Detroit Tigers. Randy Johnson worked the first eight innings to improve to 15-10, leaving after Marcus Thames’s two-run homer with no outs in the ninth. “I gave up four hits and I gave up four runs,” Johnson said. “I’m still shaking my head about that.” There was no mystery: three of the hits were homers, and Thames’s came after a walk. Johnson had been 1-10 in his career when allowing three home runs, but this time he was so dominant otherwise that he won easily. He struck out eight and walked one. Entering with a two-run lead, Rivera allowed a double off the right-field wall to Magglio Ordóñez. Then he fell behind Carlos Guillén, 3-1, before Guillén chased a sinker and grounded out to third. The next two hitters grounded out weakly to end the game and give Rivera his 33rd save. Even with a fragile elbow, Rivera seemed like himself, throwing 96 miles an hour with the same mechanics as always. “I don’t think there is a difference in the way I’ve been throwing,” Rivera said. ” But there will be differences between now and the postseason, an increasingly likely destination for the Yankees, who led Boston by eight games in the American League East. Torre spoke about the need to give Rivera more time to warm up. He also pledged not to use Rivera in the eighth, which he has done 11 times this season. “Maybe down the road, we’ll find a block of time to shut him down,” Torre said. “But right now, there doesn’t seem to be any danger in letting him pitch.” Torre did not rule out using Rivera for a third straight day if he needs him tonight, depending on how Rivera feels. Rivera called his condition discomfort, not pain, and he admitted to feeling sore. He said that he had never felt anything like this, and that it was completely different from what he felt in 1992, when he needed reconstructive surgery. This problem is not structural, Torre said, and Rivera was getting heat, ice and ultrasound treatment on the elbow and forearm. The reason to be careful now, Rivera said, was to be strong in October. “October, I’ll be fine  yeah, definitely,” he said. “If I have to take time now to make sure that everything’s O.K., I will do that instead of not being O.K. and missing October.” The Tigers, who have the best record in the league, also appear headed to the playoffs. The Yankees finished their regular-season series against Detroit with five victories in seven games, losing only on June 1 and in the second game of Wednesday’s doubleheader. Both times, Rivera was being rested. That points to his obvious importance. “It’s always a concern,” Alex Rodriguez said of Rivera. “You just want to make sure you stay strong through the finish line with no injuries.” Rodriguez broke out of a 2-for-29 slump with hits in his last three at-bats yesterday. He batted fifth, behind Jorge Posada, because Torre said he did not want to juggle Rodriguez’s spot in the lineup. After popping up with the bases loaded in the first inning, Rodriguez blooped a single to left for the Yankees’ first run in the third. He doubled and scored in the fifth inning and led off the seventh with his 27th home run. The fans stood and cheered after the homer, and Rodriguez eagerly bounded up the dugout steps for a curtain call. “Joe sent me out there,” Rodriguez said. “I said, ‘Sweet  I haven’t done that in a while.’ ” After striking out four times last Friday in Anaheim, Rodriguez said he felt fine. But he finished the weekend 1 for 15 with 10 strikeouts, and with time to reflect, he said, the contrast was clear. “I stunk,” he said. “It was painful to watch me. I couldn’t even watch video  it was that bad. But that’s baseball. You stink one day and you’re good the next few days.” Other Yankees contributed offensively, including Derek Jeter, who reached base four times, and Bobby Abreu, who had a double and a two-run single. But mostly, the Yankees won because of Johnson  and Rivera, the sore-armed savior who finished up.","completion":"\\"Rivera's Resilience: Pitching Through Pain for Yankee Victory\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sophie's eyes widened as she took in her two options. The radiant diamond ring glinted in the warm sunlight, the brilliance of the jewel caught her breath.

Sophie pondered the decision, her heart touched by the sentimentality and connection to Greg's family that the ruby ring embodied. However, she knew that a ruby didn't align with her tastes as much as the sparkly new diamond. Despite the sentimental value, the ruby ring seemed to lack a certain luster and radiance. It was as if life had somewhat diminished its beauty. The diamond ring, on the other hand, had Sophie spellbound. It was a contemporary design, sleek and elegant, and a symbol of a new beginning. She could envision herself donning the diamond ring at their engagement party, showcasing its gleaming sparkle to their family and friends. In many ways, this ring symbolized the start of their lives together. Sophie was aware that this decision was not only about aesthetics or what suited her personal preferences, but also about the future and how these rings could ultimately contribute to the narrative she and Greg were crafting together. A new life beckoned the couple, full of fresh experiences and significant milestones to embark upon. And so, having this new ring as the cornerstone of their journey was an attractive prospect. Greg patiently awaited Sophie's decision, his eyes filled with love and understanding. He knew that this was a significant moment for them both, and he wanted to ensure that Sophie's choice was an authentic reflection of her feelings. And so, after much contemplation, Sophie gently took Greg's hand and said, with a tone of resoluteness: \\"I choose the diamond.\\" In that instant, Greg's expression transformed into one of sheer joy. He slipped the shimmering diamond ring onto Sophie's finger, which sparkled magnificently against her radiant skin. It was a perfect fit, and it seemed to embody everything their relationship stood for: unwavering love, new beginnings, and continual growth. As they embraced, Greg whispered into Sophie's ear that he'd cherish her decision forever. It seemed only fitting that their love story embarked upon a course adorned with the glittering diamond, which seemed to beckon a lifetime of adventure, devotion, and happiness. And so, the couple began planning the next steps of their joined path, feeling grateful for the decision made, and excited about the journey that lay ahead. The diamond ring illuminated their collective dreams, and they knew that this dazzling symbol of their love would guide them through whatever twists, turns, and trials their lives might bring. As for the ruby ring, although it didn't become Sophie's engagement ring, it still held a special place in their hearts as it continued to symbolize the rich family history of Greg's lineage, weaving its tale through the backdrop of their own story. The diamond and ruby rings, holding distinct significances in their lives, would endure as cherished symbols of the past, present, and future. Sophie's choice reaffirmed the couple's deep love and unbreakable bond, and they proudly embraced the beginning of their new life together, encircled by the brilliance of the chosen diamond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Option i. Can hold everything in the universe: 1. Consider the scope of this option - it is extremely broad, including everything in the universe. 2. Think about how this relates to the goal of representing Earth - this scope goes far beyond just Earth, as it also encompasses other celestial bodies like stars, planets, and galaxies. 3. Assess whether this captures the essence of the goal - it's too broad relative to the goal of focusing on Earth. Option ii. Can hold everyone in the world: 1. Consider the scope of this option - it is focused on Earth and its inhabitants, which is more specific than option i. 2. Think about how this relates to the goal of representing Earth - the focus on everyone in the world encompasses a core aspect of the Earth, its inhabitants, creating a connection between the two. 3.

GM said earlier this month that it lost 747 million in the region during 2011, despite record profits for the fiscal year worldwide.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two ways in which the body cools down?\\" is \\"Sweating and constricting blood vessels\\"?","completion":"Not exactly. The correct answer should be \\"Sweating and dilating blood vessels.\\" Sweating is the first way the body cools down, as mentioned in the paragraph. When the body temperature rises, sweat glands in the skin produce sweat. The sweat evaporates from the skin's surface, which in turn helps to cool down the body. The second way the body cools down is through dilating blood vessels, not constricting them. When the body is overheated, the blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This increases blood flow to the body's surface, allowing more heat to reach the surface, and then radiate off the body into the surrounding environment. On the other hand, constricting blood vessels occurs when the body needs to retain heat, like in colder temperatures. When blood vessels constrict, or narrow, blood flow to the body's surface is reduced, which decreases the amount of heat that can be lost to the air."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Before trying to treat yourself, see your doctor to get a proper diagnosis and discuss your treatment options. Tell your doctor you’re interested in taking turmeric as a natural treatment. You may need to work with your doctor to manage your condition. Don’t stop taking a medication prescribed by your doctor unless they say it’s okay.","completion":"The key point in the text is that turmeric can be utilized as a natural remedy for various health issues such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, and diabetes. Nevertheless, self-diagnosis and treatment can be risky due to the possibility of misidentifying your condition since some diseases exhibit similar symptoms as others. Therefore, it is paramount to consult with a healthcare professional to receive a correct diagnosis and to discuss potential treatment methods, before attempting any self-treatment regime. If you are considering using turmeric as a therapeutic option, it is crucial to communicate this to your healthcare provider in order to ensure it is a suitable and safe choice for your particular condition. In situations where you have already been prescribed medication by a doctor, it is distinctly advised not to withdraw from this treatment unless you are given express permission from your doctor to do so. It becomes evident that whilst turmeric can potentially serve as a natural treatment for certain conditions, the management of one's health condition requires careful consultation and ongoing collaboration with medical professionals. This helps guarantee that any potential benefits from alternative medications such as turmeric are realized safely without hampering any existing medical treatment strategies. It is vital to remember that stopping prescribed medication prematurely without a doctor's advice could jeopardize one's health. Therefore, continuous, open communication, and cooperation with your healthcare provider is emphasized in managing your healthcare condition, particularly when considering supplementing your treatment with naturally occurring compounds like turmeric."},{"prompt":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Title: The Player Movie plot: Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is a studio executive dating story editor Bonnie Sherow (Cynthia Stevenson). He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards. Kahane continues goading Mill about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot the two men fight. Mill loses his balance and falls, and feeling threatened, kills Kahane, then makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day, Mill receives another postcard. Mill attends Kahanes funeral and gets along with June; she knows none of the other mourners.

The \\"miracle\\" teenager found alive days after a plane crash in the wilderness of Washington state told NBC News that she has a newfound respect for life. Autumn Veatch, 16, was aboard a small plane flying from Montana to Washington with her step-grandparents when the aircraft crashed into a remote area in the northern part of the state. Veatch was the sole survivor of the crash and fought her way from the burning wreckage and through dense woods for more than two days before she was found by hikers on Monday. The teenager shared her dramatic story of survival with NBC News. Veatch told NBC News that she and Leland and Sharon Bowman, 62 and 63, were flying over eastern Washington when they were struck with low visibility and poor weather conditions. \\"Everything was white, like everything — all the windows — everything was white, and then suddenly it was just all trees, and then it was fire,\\" she said. After the Beech A-35 aircraft crashed into the trees, and quickly burst into flames, Veatch managed to escape, but her grandparents were trapped. She was unable to save them, suffering second-degree burns on her right hand while trying to pull her grandfather from the wreckage. ||||| Autumn Veatch shares her story of surviving a plane crash and walking two days in the wilderness to reach help. (Photo: KING) The 16-year-old Bellingham girl who survived a plane crash and two nights alone in the woods before walking to safety spoke publicly for the first time Thursday. Autumn Veatch was flying home Saturday with her step-grandparents, Sharon and Leland Bowman, when their small plane crashed into some trees in central Washington. Autumn remembers the moment their plane went down. \\"It wasn't obvious that we were gonna go down, honestly, because it was just completely white and then it was just trees. And then it was just screaming beyond that,\\" she recalled. \\"All of a sudden it was just all trees, and then it was fire. They were both screaming.\\" Her grandparents were trapped inside the plane. Amber tried to pull them out. \\"I was trying to help them. I couldn't get to grandma at all. There was nothing I could have done to get to her, but grandpa, he pulled himself halfway out. And that's when I was going and I was reaching and was trying to pull him out.\\" She burned her hand trying get him out, but she couldn't save him. \\"I just got burned really bad and I couldn't do anything,\\" she said. \\"I just told them that I loved them and that it would be ok.\\" Autumn said she ran. She followed a river downstream and hiked for days. \\"I was really shocked. My instinct was to just go straight downhill,\\" she said. She spent two nights in the forest. \\"After a few hours it started feeling really hopeless, like no idea at all where I was. So I just kind of... I ended up stripping down again. I laid next to a few trees and was just sitting there and was thinking I'm freezing... and it was starting to rain too,\\" she recalled. \\"So I was cold and I was thinking, so on those survivor shows that I used to watch all the time, what always gets people?

Question: Which action painter was Jack the Dripper? Answer:","completion":"Jack the Dripper is a nickname given to the influential American action painter Jackson Pollock (1912–1956). The moniker arose from Pollock's innovative painting technique, where he would literally drip and splash paint onto the canvas in a seemingly chaotic manner. The nickname reflects both the painter's first name, Jack, and his signature painting style. Born in Cody, Wyoming, Pollock grew up across the American Southwest and eventually moved to New York City to study art. He gained prominence in the New York School art movement, which was marked by the rise of abstract expressionism in the mid-20th century. Unlike traditional painters, who used brushes to apply paint onto the canvas, Pollock developed his own unique method, which involved the use of sticks, trowels, knives, and brushes to manipulate the dripping paint. This technique allowed him to create dynamic, rhythmic compositions that captured a sense of raw energy and movement. These seemingly chaotic patterns of dripped and splattered paint would interact with each other, creating complex visual textures and impressive visual effects. Pollock's innovative approach to painting was not just about the final result, though; it was the physical act of painting itself. His method allowed him to directly express his emotions and instincts through the medium of paint, becoming one with the work. Pollock's groundbreaking technique had a profound impact on the art world. His work paved the way for a new generation of artists who sought to break free from the constraints of traditional painting and explore more abstract, expressive ways of creating art. As such, Pollock's legacy extends beyond his own artwork, influencing other notable action painters like Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Robert Motherwell. Some of Pollock's most well-known works that showcase his \\"drip\\" painting style are: 1. \\"Number 1, 1949\\": Also known as \\"Lavender Mist,\\" this painting is considered one of Pollock's greatest achievements due to its large size, vibrant colors, and intricate web of drips and splatters. 2. \\"No. 5, 1948\\": A quintessential example of Pollock's action painting, this piece is famous for selling at an auction for 140 million, making it the most expensive painting at its time in 2006. 3. \\"Autumn Rhythm (Number 30, 1950)\\": This large, expressive work is characteristic of Pollock's mature style and embodies the essence of action painting. 4. \\"One: Number 31, 1950\\": Widely regarded as one of Pollock's masterpieces, this painting perfectly captures the dynamic, rhythmic movement of his dripped paint technique. In conclusion, Jackson Pollock, also known as Jack the Dripper, revolutionized the world of painting with his innovative action painting technique. He not only defied traditional methods but also showed how expressive and emotional the physical act of painting can be. This approach inspired a whole new movement in art, cementing Jackson Pollock's influential status in the history of modern art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant","completion":"Based on the given movie review sentence, the sentiment expressed is negative. There are several indicators in the phrase that illustrate the reviewer's disapproval or dissatisfaction with the character of Janice Beard, portrayed by Eileen Walsh. First, the use of the word \\"charmless\\" implies that the character of Janice Beard does not have an attractive or captivating quality. In the context of movie reviews, characters with charm are often well-received and connect with the audience, driving the story forward. The lack of charm, in this case, points to the reviewer's perception that the character fails to engage the audience and may come off as uninteresting or one-dimensional. Second, the term \\"vacant\\" is used to describe Janice Beard's persona. A vacant personality usually suggests a lack of depth or substance, which can be interpreted as dull, shallow, or hollow. In movie reviews, three-dimensional and multi-layered characters are generally preferred as they give the audience a more authentic experience and allow them to connect and empathize with the character. A vacant character typically does not evoke strong emotions from the audience, which is seen as a major drawback in the eyes of the reviewer. Overall, the sentiment expressed in the review sentence is negative because the reviewer is criticizing Janice Beard's character as being charmless and vacant, which indicates their dissatisfaction with the character development and portrayal in the movie. This illustrates their belief that the character fails to create an engaging and enjoyable experience for the viewers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - La Mancha is a natural and historical region located on an arid but fertile, elevated plateau (610 m or 2000 ft.) of central Spain, south of Madrid, from the mountains of Toledo to the western spurs of the hills of Cuenca, and bordered to the South by the Sierra Morena and to the North by the Alcarria region. La Mancha includes portions of the modern provinces of Cuenca, Toledo, and Albacete, and most of the Ciudad Real province. La Mancha historical comarca constitutes the southern portion of CastillaLa Mancha autonomous community and makes up most of the present-day administrative region. - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\"). - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Ciudad Real (English: \\"Royal City\\") is a city in CastileLa Mancha, Spain, with a population of c. 75,000. It is the capital of the province of Ciudad Real.

Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - A natural region is a basic geographic unit. Usually it is a region which is distinguished by its common natural features of geography, geology, and climate. - The province of Ciudad Real is a province in the southwestern part of the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Congress's latest awful tech-policy idea: the Net-censorship bill No idea is too bad not to get a second chance in Congress -- especially when it comes to tech policy. This week's demonstration of that principle is a bill called the \\"Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act,\\" which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday after being set aside in September. COICA would empower the attorney general to get court orders barring Internet providers from routing their users to sites suspected of copyright infringement. The bill's text provides a generous definition of what would qualify a site for such punishment: It could be \\"primarily designed\\" or marketed for copyright infringement or have no other \\"demonstrable commercially significant purpose or use.\\" Copyright infringement, in turn, is broadly defined: It could include not just hosting downloads or streams of photos, music or movies but also providing \\"a link or aggregated links to other sites or Internet resources for obtaining access to such copies.\\" (Disclosure: I've linked to DVD-decrypting and file-sharing programs many times. Then again, it's now legal to decrypt a DVD to collect short clips for review and commentary.) A suspected Web site would not be guaranteed its day in court. COICA requires that the government notify the site and its domain registrar but does not demand a trial and a verdict. A simple injunction by a judge will suffice. It's a rough equivalent of the \\"judicial civil forfeiture\\" proceeding through which the Feds can take a suspected drug dealer's property without first securing a conviction. COICA wouldn't actually remove a site from the Internet, though. Instead, it would compel Internet providers and domain-name registries to remove their own listings of a site's domain name. Users could still get to that site by typing its Internet Protocol address, just as you can get to washingtonpost.com by typing 12.129.147.65 in your browser's address bar. The Motion Picture Association of America thinks the bill is fantastic. Others do not. Ninety-six pioneering Internet engineers have signed an open letter calling COICA a dangerous, unsound measure that would \\"risk fragmenting the Internet's global domain name system.\\" The man who invented the Web itself, Tim Berners-Lee, doesn't like this bill, either. Forty-nine law professors signed their own letter calling COICA \\"an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.\\" So, people who helped build the Internet think this law will have disastrous consequences, and people who know the law think it will get thrown out in court first. And yet COICA sailed through the Judiciary Committee on a 19-0 vote, with some of those yeas coming from senators who should know better, to judge from their records. I know it's fashionable to say that nobody in Congress reads anything before voting on it. But, seriously: Did anybody on the Judiciary Committee read this thing before voting on it? One senator has: Sen. Ron Wyden (D.-Ore.) told IDG News Service's Grant Gross that he'll oppose the bill. That should stop it from going anywhere this year--but I won't be surprised to see COICA re-emerge, zombie-like, in the next session. Because bad tech-policy ideas often get third chances too. (2:58 p.m. Added a line about COICA's September setback and noted the chances of it not proceeding this year.)

If a Russian site is offering illegal content to American citizens via American ISPs and American domain names, it is breaking American law every time it delivers its content to American households. The American justice system has already determined piracy and counterfeiting have no valid place in America. If these sites were hosted in America, they would be shut down in an instant. The logical conclusion is not to let the country with the least online laws decide for the world what is or is not permitted online. That will just lead to a 'race to the bottom', with every cyber-criminal migrating to the Ukraine or Bangladesh. The only reasonable course of action is to block it at the ISP level. Piracy and counterfeiting are not free speech. If an illegal torrent site wants to open a legal free speech website, they will still be able to do so.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato's sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato. They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862. Guess a valid title for it!

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less seeds will sprout happens, how will it affect LESS vegetables. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've provided suggests that fewer seeds will sprout than expected. This circumstance could arise due to several reasons, such as inadequate water, soil conditions, or sowing depth, among other factors. If fewer seeds sprout, it will directly affect the final number of vegetable plants growing in the garden, and consequently, the total number of vegetables that can be harvested. This outcome will be due to having a lower initial number of sprouted seedlings to develop, mature, and ultimately produce vegetables. In essence, with fewer plants, fewer vegetables will be produced, thus leading to reduced yields from the garden. The supposed perturbation does have a direct effect on the overall vegetable gardening process. However, it is important to consider that many factors can contribute to seed germination and sprouting, and optimal cultivation practices should be undertaken to mitigate these potential issues. Some of these practices may include using high-quality seeds, ensuring proper watering, maintaining appropriate soil conditions, and providing the necessary nutrients.

This revision, often referred to as the \\"Revised GRE\\" or \\"GRE Revised General Test,\\" introduced several key changes aimed at better aligning the test with the demands of modern graduate education: 1. Enhanced scoring scale: The Revised GRE updated the scoring scale for the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning sections. Previously, these sections were scored on a 200-800 scale, with 10-point increments. In the revised test, these two sections have a scoring range of 130-170, with 1-point increments. This change was made to provide a more accurate and detailed assessment of test-takers' abilities. 2. New question types: The revised test introduced several new question types, including text completion and sentence equivalence questions in the Verbal Reasoning section, and numeric entry and multiple-choice questions with more than one correct answer in the Quantitative Reasoning section. These changes were made to better evaluate a range of cognitive skills, including critical reasoning, problem-solving, and data interpretation. 3. Changes to the Analytical Writing section: The Analytical Writing section now consists of two tasks—an \\"Analyze an Issue\\" task and an \\"Analyze an Argument\\" task—that require test-takers to formulate and support their own arguments, as well as evaluate others' arguments. This revision was intended to more accurately assess higher-order reasoning skills and the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively. 4. Adaptivity: In the revised test, the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning sections are section-level adaptive, meaning that a test-taker's performance on the first section of each of these sections determines the difficulty level of the subsequent section. This change allows the test to better measure a test-taker's abilities across a wider range of skill levels. 5. User-friendly test design: The revised GRE introduced several features designed to improve the overall test-taking experience, such as the ability to skip questions and return to them later within a section, as well as to change answers within a section. These changes were made to allow test-takers to employ various test-taking strategies and better manage their time during the test. Since the 2011 revision, there have been no major updates to the GRE. However, ETS regularly reviews and updates the test content to ensure that it remains relevant and useful for evaluating the skills and knowledge needed for success in graduate programs. Thus, it is essential for test-takers to remain informed about any future changes to the GRE and to prepare accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: Popol Vuh (also Popol Wuj) is a cultural narrative that recounts the mythology and history of the K'iche' people who inhabit the Guatemalan Highlands northwest of present-day Guatemala City. The Popol Vuh is a creation narrative written by the K'iche' people before the Spanish conquest of Guatemala, originally preserved through oral tradition until approximately 1550 when it was written down. The survival of the Popol Vuh is credited to the 18th century Dominican friar Francisco Ximenez who made a copy of the original text in Spanish The name \\"Popol Vuh\\" translates as \\"Book of the Community\\", \\"Book of Counsel\\", or more literally as \\"Book of the People\\". The Popol Vuh includes the Mayan creation myth, beginning with the exploits of the Hero Twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque. Context: Since its rediscovery by Europeans in the 19th century, the Popol Vuh has attracted the attention of many authors. For example, the myths and legends included in Louis L'Amour's novel The Haunted Mesa are largely based on the Popol Vuh. The planet of Camazotz in Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time is named for the bat-god of the hero-twins story. The text was also used by German film director Werner Herzog as extensive narration for the first chapter of his movie Fata Morgana (released 1972). Mexican painter Diego Rivera did a series of watercolors in 1931, as illustrations for the book. In 1934, the Franco-American early avant-garde composer Edgard Varese wrote his Ecuatorial - a setting of words from the Popol Vuh for bass soloist and various instruments. The Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera began writing his opus 44 symphonic work Popol Vuh in 1975, but left the work incomplete at his death in 1983. In Munich, Germany in 1969, keyboardist Florian Fricke--at the time ensconced in Mayan myth--formed a band named Popol Vuh with synth player Frank Fiedler and percussionist Holger Trulzsch. Their 1970 debut album, Affenstunde, reflected this spiritual connection. The band is notable especially for its extremely early experimentation with forms that became popularized through the modern electronic, new age/ambient music that was to follow years later. They also worked together with Werner Herzog for 5 of his movies. Another band by the same name, this one of Norwegian descent, formed around the same time, its name also inspired by the K'iche' writings. Question: What did the authors said about him ? Answer:","completion":"The various authors, artists, and composers who have been inspired by the Popol Vuh have expressed their fascination and appreciation for the ancient text in different ways, often reflecting their own personal styles and creative approaches. Louis L'Amour, a popular American author, incorporated the myths and legends of the Popol Vuh into his novel The Haunted Mesa. Although L'Amour does not provide direct quotations about the Popol Vuh, his usage of its themes and ideas demonstrates his interest in the K'iche' culture and its mythology. Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, named the planet Camazotz in her book after the bat-god in the hero-twins story of the Popol Vuh. This illustrates her appreciation for the rich mythology depicted in the text and how it can be adapted to new, imaginative contexts. Werner Herzog, the German film director, used the Popol Vuh as a foundation for the narration of the first chapter of his movie Fata Morgana. This shows his respect for the ancient text, its captivating stories, and the unique cultural lens it provides. Diego Rivera, the Mexican muralist and painter, created a series of watercolors in 1931 as illustrations for the book. This artistic expression of the Popol Vuh testifies to Rivera's admiration for the K'iche' culture and his desire to visually represent their stories and history. Edgard Varèse, a Franco-American composer, created a musical piece called Ecuatorial that incorporated words from the Popol Vuh. This demonstrates Varèse's recognition of the cultural significance and the poetic nature of the text, using it to inspire his avant-garde compositions. Alberto Ginastera, an Argentinian composer, began working on his opus 44 symphonic work Popol Vuh in 1975, but it was left incomplete at the time of his death. His dedication to this project reflects his passion for the K'iche' myths and their potential to inspire new musical expressions. Florian Fricke, a German keyboardist, formed a band named Popol Vuh in 1969, as he was deeply interested in Mayan mythology. Their debut album, Affenstunde, showcased this connection and contributed to the popularization of electronic and ambient music. The band's choice of name and ongoing inspiration from the K'iche' text reveal their admiration for the Popol Vuh and its cultural significance. In summary, while most of the authors, artists, and composers have not directly stated their thoughts about the Popol Vuh, their works and creations demonstrate a deep respect and fascination for the K'iche' myths, history, and culture documented in the ancient text. The enduring influence of the Popol Vuh continues to capture the imaginations of individuals from various creative fields, serving as a testament to the power and significance of the K'iche' people's mythology and history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Robert Owen was born in Wales in 1771. At the age of ten he went to work. His employer had a large private library so Owen was able to educate himself. He read a lot in his spare time and at nineteen he was given the job of superintendent at a Manchester cotton mill. He was so successful there that he persuaded his employer to buy the New Lanark mill in Scotland. When he arrived at New Lanark it was a dirty little town with a population of 2,000 people. Nobody paid any attention to the workers' houses or their children's education. The conditions in the factories were very bad. There was a lot of crime and the men spent most of their wages on alcoholic drinks. Owen improved the houses. He encouraged people to be clean and save money. He opened a shop and sold the workers cheap, well-made goods to help them. He limited the sale of alcoholic drinks. Above all, he fixed his mind on the children's education. In 1816 he opened the first free primary school in Britain. People came from all over the country to visit Owen's factory. They saw that the workers were healthier and more efficient than in other towns. Their children were better fed and better educated. Owen tried the same experiment in the United States. He bought some land there in 1825, but the community was too far away. He could not keep it under control and lost most of his money. Owen never stopped fighting for his idea. Above all he believed that people are not born good or bad. He was a practical man and his ideas were practical. \\"If you give people good working conditions\\", he thought, \\"they will work well and, the most important thing of all, if you give them the chance to learn, they will be better people.\\" Question: From the passage we may infer that Owen was born _ .

My first step is to understand what is meant by \\"pandemic\\" and \\"cancer.\\" A pandemic generally refers to a widespread infectious disease affecting a large number of people across multiple geographic regions. It typically spreads rapidly and may have high fatality rates. Cancer, on the other hand, refers to a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. There are various types of cancer, and they can occur due to various factors including genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Step 2: Compare the terms. Now that I have an understanding of both terms, I need to analyze whether cancer fits the criteria of a pandemic. I will consider the following points: - Cancer is indeed a widespread disease, affecting millions of people all over the world. - However, cancer is not an infectious disease.

Given the information from Steps 1 and 2, I can now answer the question: Cancer is not considered a pandemic, as it is not an infectious disease that rapidly spreads in the population. While it is a global health issue and affects millions of people, it does not fit the criteria of a pandemic due to its non-infectious nature and diverse range of causes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan.

The first sentence provides background information about The Forum Shops, describing its size, connection to Caesars Palace, and location on the Las Vegas Strip. 2. The second sentence states that, in terms of sales per square foot, it is the highest grossing mall in the United States. 3. The next sentence mentions that The Forum Shops has seen declining sales in its stores over the past decade. To assess if the following sentence is consistent with the preceding text, let's compare the information provided: - The second sentence talks about the mall's high sales per square foot, indicating that it is very successful. - The following sentence states that the mall has experienced declining sales, suggesting a decrease in its success. Given this analysis, the supplied sentence about declining sales over the past decade initially appears contradictory to the high-grossing status mentioned in the preceding text. However, it is still possible for a mall to have the highest sales per square foot in the United States while experiencing a decline in sales over the past decade. The sentence does not indicate that the decline has caused The Forum Shops to lose its high-grossing status, only that sales have been declining without any additional comparisons provided.

Loss of creative expression: Avatars serve as an extension of an individual's creative expression and are a form of visual art. By removing art from avatar media, we risk limiting the potential for users to fully express their creativity and uniqueness in the online environment. 2. Reduction in visual stimulation: The passage emphasizes that avatar media art is an \\"ever-changing visually stimulating entity.\\" If art is removed from avatar media, this dynamic and engaging visual aspect will be lost. This could lead to less interaction among users or less interest in engaging with the platform, eventually diminishing the appeal of the online environment and potentially leading to a reduction in its user base. 3. Inability to fully explore new media art: According to the passage, \\"new media art encompasses the use of digital technologies and the Internet as media,\\" but also highlights that it is more than just these elements. It involves a \\"hybrid production and an interplay between art, technology, and humans.\\" The removal of art from avatar media would compromise this balance, limiting our understanding of new media art and preventing advancements in this field. 4. Compromised connection between art and technology: Art and technology are intertwined in new media art, and avatar media helps bridge the gap between the two. By eliminating art from avatar media art, that connection could be compromised, stifling opportunities for future innovation and collaboration between the fields of art and technology. 5. Impact on artistic communities: Removing art from avatar media art may have profound effects on both the creators and consumers within artistic communities, especially those who work within the context of new media art. This could potentially hinder artists' careers and limit the development of new ideas and practices within the realm of new media art. In conclusion, if art is removed from avatar media art, it could result in a substantial loss of creative expression, reduction in visual stimulation, limitations in exploring new media art, interference in the relationship between art and technology, and negative impacts on artistic communities.

The Domestic Violence Legal Assistance Program fills the gap of legal resources for domestic violence survivors who can't afford an attorney. Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ...

Write an article based on this \\"Residents in Bridgend county borough will only be able to throw away two black bin bags of household rubbish a fortnight under council changes.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Bridgend County Borough Residents Limited to Two Black Bin Bags per Fortnight due to Council Changes Introduction: The Bridgend County Borough Council has announced changes in waste management policies, limiting the disposal of household rubbish to two black bin bags per household every fortnight. These changes have been implemented to encourage better waste management practices among local residents and follow similar measures adopted by councils across the UK. Step 1: Understand the goal of the policy change One of the primary objectives behind this policy change is to foster a sense of responsibility among residents regarding waste disposal and management. This move is aligned with the council's ongoing efforts in pushing for a cleaner and greener environment, focusing on waste reduction, recycling, and sustainable living practices. Step 2: Discuss the problems associated with excessive waste Excessive household waste poses significant problems for both the environment and the local economy. Landfills are reaching capacity, leading to a surge in waste management costs for the borough and increasing the carbon footprint due to transportation of the waste. Additionally, the overflow of waste attracts pests and wildlife, posing risks to public health and safety. Step 3: Explain the benefits of the policy change By limiting waste disposal to two black bin bags per fortnight, the council anticipates that households will be more conscientious about their waste management practices. This could lead to an increase in recycling rates, supporting the local recycling industry and helping the council achieve its environmental targets. This measure would not only reduce the financial burden on the taxpayers but also contribute to an improved quality of life through a cleaner and healthier environment. Step 4: Offer tips and recommendations for residents To help residents adapt to this change, the article could provide suggestions on ways to reduce waste, such as: - Practicing mindful shopping by planning meals, reducing single-use plastic consumption, and opting for reusable bags - Repurposing or upcycling items before discarding them - Composting food scraps and garden waste to reduce the amount of rubbish in black bin bags - Check and adhere to local recycling guidelines to increase the volume of recyclable waste sorted correctly Step 5: Address concerns and potential drawbacks The new waste management policy may receive some criticism from local residents, particularly those who already struggle to manage their waste within the current limits. The article should address these concerns by discussing the support available from the council, which could include: - Information on how to maximise recycling efforts - Access to additional waste disposal facilities for specific situations - Resources and guidance for households that have difficulty adjusting to the new system Conclusion: The decision by Bridgend County Borough Council to limit the disposal of household rubbish to two black bin bags per fortnight reflects the growing global awareness of the need for better waste management practices. As residents adapt to this new policy and embrace the benefits of a cleaner environment, we can expect to see a healthier, greener, and more sustainable future for the community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: A meteorologist is analyzing the weather patterns of two different countries. She notices that all signs indicate that Milshen is experiencing adiabatic cooling. She doesn't see any indications of adiabatic cooling in Limlen, though. This is important information to relay in her broadcast later tonight to the citizens of both countries and she is glad she noticed it. and a hint : Adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. As the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops. This condensation normally occurs on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.Frontal and cyclonic lift occur when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure by a process called convergence. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass just ahead of the front. Please answer this question : Is the air more or less saturated in Limlen?","completion":"Based on the given situation and information, it appears that Milshen is experiencing adiabatic cooling, while Limlen is not showing any signs of this process. In adiabatic cooling, air containing water vapor rises, cools to its dew point, and becomes saturated as water vapor condenses to form cloud drops. Since adiabatic cooling is not occurring in Limlen, we can infer that the air in Limlen is less saturated compared to Milshen. Adiabatic cooling is facilitated by one or more of three possible lifting agents - cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic. This process results in the formation of clouds, which can vary in forms depending on the lifting mechanism and the stability of the air mass involved. In Milshen, the presence of clouds and adiabatic cooling suggests that the lifting mechanisms are at work, leading to the saturation of the air. In contrast, Limlen does not exhibit any indications of adiabatic cooling. Therefore, the air in Limlen is less saturated compared to the air in Milshen, where the adiabatic cooling process is happening. Less saturated air means that the water vapor content in the air is lower, leading to fewer clouds and lower chances of precipitation. It is crucial for the meteorologist to convey this difference in saturation levels and weather conditions between the two countries during the broadcast, as this information is valuable for the citizens' daily activities and planning. While Milshen experiences more saturated air and potentially cloudier or wetter weather conditions due to the adiabatic cooling process, Limlen has less saturated air and possibly clearer skies or drier conditions. This distinction in weather patterns between the two countries can be attributed to the absence of lifting agents in Limlen, preventing adiabatic cooling and consequential air saturation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial begin to sing and clap along to the tune and so do the jury of lost souls. An enraged Devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop the heroes, but the spirits he conjures also fall prey to the sway of Daniel's music. A frustrated Devil finally leaves, returning to Hell and taking Weez and all his other minions with him. The two mice...","completion":"The Devil takes Weez and all his other minions to hell with him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

For example, when Franklin (the turtle) wanted a pet, his parents did not want it to be a frog. They felt that frogs belong in a pond. Isn't that where turtles belong? And why is it that Little Bear's animal friends can all talk and behave like people, but his friend Emily has a dog that can only bark and fetch? Tell me that isn't a mystery! Dog lovers can be reassured (less worried or frightened) by Kipper and his friends. These dogs are very human. However, the only time they wear clothes is when they put on bathing suits to go swimming. I am confused! Speaking of dogs, could Pluto ever be Goofy's pet? I don't get it! What did the great Mr. Disney have in mind? And this is unfair! The other day we watched a very nice little pig setting up a picnic. One of the foods was a big ham. Could it have been a soybeam ham? Is there such a thing? I hope so! Another thing that really bothers me: what if Elmo(one of my son's favorite cartoon stars) isn't real? He can't be a mere puppet !

Then, we'll use a screwdriver (a tool that helps us turn the screws) to tighten the screws into the holes and hold the brackets in place. 5.

Article: Each section will form a loc. Start separating sections of hair on the back of your head first. Use a comb to separate the hair into a 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) thick section. Use your free hand to hold the section of hair together. If you want fatter locs, you can separate a thicker section of hair. Use sections that are 1 inch by 1 inch (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) square at the base for medium locs, or double the size for a large loc. Backcombing works best on hair that’s 6 inches (15 cm) or longer, but can work with hair as short as 3 inches (7.6 cm). Backcombing an entire head of hair can take up to 4 hours to complete. Start by combing the section of hair 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the roots, towards the direction of the scalp. Comb over the same section 5-10 times until the hair starts to bunch up towards the scalp, then slowly make your way down, towards the ends of the hair. Continue combing in 3 inches (7.6 cm) sections until the entire portion of separated hair is backcombed. You can purchase a dread comb online or at a beauty supply store. Grip the hair between your index finger and thumb, a couple of inches (about 5 cm) away from the root. Hold the section of hair tightly and run the crochet needle in between your fingers, through the hair several times. Your hair will bunch up even further. Continue doing this down the length of the hair until the entire section is knotted and looped. After you use the comb and needle, the hair should resemble a dread. Use small rubber bands to secure it at the base of the loc and at the end of the section of hair. This will hold it in place and allow it to keep its form. If you plan to go out in public before you have finished dreadlocking your hair, you may wish to use rubber bands that are the same color as your hair to create a more natural appearance. Look for products like locking gel, lock and twist gel, or beeswax. Dread cream will prevent hair and scalp dryness and will promote the forming of dreads. Squeeze a generous portion into the palm of your hand, then apply it from the root to the end of the loc. Put the loc between the palms of your hands and roll it back and forth several times so that it forms into more of a rounded shape. Start from the root and work your way down to the end of the loc. This will help form the locs and make them look uniform. Continue dreading each section of hair in even sections until the entire head has been dreaded. Do not attempt to backcomb the sections again, or you’ll have to restart the knotting process. Remove the rubber bands once you’ve dreaded all the hair. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is that dreadlocking hair involves separating sections of hair on the back of the head, backcombing and using a crochet needle to create knots and loops, securing the locs with rubber bands, applying dread cream, and rolling the locs between palms to create a uniform shape.

They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times. In an encounter with Indians, Susanna learns that her brother, an army officer, has likely been killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Out hunting, Vallian is shot.

Article:","completion":"Title: A Captain's Courage: Scott Brown Leads Celtic in Champions League Qualifier Despite Fan Absence There's an old saying in football, “it’s not about the number of supporters you have, it’s about the amount of heart you put into the game.” Celtic captain Scott Brown seems to personify this sentiment. As the Scottish team heads into their important Champions League qualifier against Linfield on Friday, the absence of their loyal fans in the stands might seem like a setback. However, Brown has made it abundantly clear that the lack of the crowd's support will not be a deterrent to the team's performance on the pitch. The occasion's gravity is undeniable. It's the sort of match-up that can propel a team into the next level of competition, drawing attention and admiration from football fans around the world. For a group as storied and well-regarded as the Celtic Football Club, there is arguably no better opportunity to seize. True to Brown's leadership, the team is refusing to dwell on any potential drawbacks or setbacks as they prepare for this monumental game. For those unfamiliar with the past clashes between Linfield and Celtic, there's a rich tapestry of history underlying this rivalry. With supporters known to engage passionately in the competition's spirit, their voices often provide a stirring backdrop behind the athletes' performances. However, Friday's match-up will differ significantly from past encounters due to the absence of Celtic supporters in the stands. While Brown acknowledges the impact of their fanbase, he remains firm in his conviction that not having them present during the game will not hold the team back. The Celtic captain expressed his sentiments in a recent interview, saying, \\"we are professional footballers, and we know how to handle a situation like this. We are here to play football and represent the club.\\" Scott Brown emphasized the criticality of the players focusing on their game, rather than on what they cannot control. \\"Of course, we would love to have our fans there with us, but we can't change the circumstances,\\" he expounded. \\"It's time to show our true character and concentrate on what really matters – giving 100% on that field.\\" Brown's words of resolution echo a determination that is pervasive within the team. They understand that on Friday, they are representing more than just themselves; they are representing a club with an illustrious history and a fanbase worldwide. The team will need to keep their focus clear and their eyes on the prize, as the match against Linfield could be a significant turning point for them in the Champions League. Furthermore, there's no reason to believe that Celtic fans globally won't be cheering on their team in spirit. The new age of connectivity we find ourselves in can prove to be an advantage in this situation. The game will be broadcast on multiple platforms worldwide, and fans are encouraged to follow the match through their preferred medium, offering their support from afar. As the game approaches, fans and critics alike will be closely watching the performance of Celtic in this Champions League qualifier. Scott Brown’s emphasis on the players' resilience and dedication to the club serves as an inspiring call to arms for a team ready to face any potential obstacles on the pitch. In the end, it's not about the stands being full or empty; it's about the heart and soul the players put into the game. As Celtic Football Club heads into Friday's qualifier, their intrepid captain Scott Brown leads the charge, undaunted by the lack of familiar faces in the crowd. As Brown appropriately captures the essence of the situation, \\"football is football, fans or no fans.\\" The determination of this mighty team, backed by the spirit of their fanbase far and wide, is set to show the world what true character and grit look like on the field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It might involve a decision or judgement, but it doesn't challenge or change any established rule. Based on these guidelines: Let's analyze the provided sentence: \\"Consequently, the proposed claims against Clay would be futile, and we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in denying the plaintiff's motion to amend.\\" This sentence does not overrule or negate any existing legal decision or precedent. Instead, it is presenting a conclusion or judgement on a specific claim. It asserts a judgement on the futility of the proposed claims against Clay and mentions that the court decision to deny the plaintiff's motion to amend does not constitute an \\"abuse of discretion\\". Final step is to classify it into the suitable category: This statement would thus be classified as 'non-overruling'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes.

Translate this to English?","completion":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's first translate the given sentence: \\"We need to work to ensure that we don't go through another banking crisis like the one we're going through right now.\\" The global economy has faced massive challenges due to banking crises, such as the one experienced during the 2007-2008 financial crisis caused by the collapse of the housing market in the United States. With a focus on preventing such banking crises in the future, numerous measures can be implemented to ensure financial stability and reduce the adverse impact on economies and people's lives. First, it is crucial to improve regulation and supervision in the banking sector. Governments should work together with international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to establish global standards that enhance the stability of financial institutions. These standards should enhance the transparency of financial activities, including the disclosure of potential risks, and ensure that banks hold adequate capital and maintain sufficient liquidity levels to withstand potential economic shocks. Secondly, central banks must play a proactive role in monitoring and managing financial risks. They can do this by implementing macroprudential policies that prevent the build-up of systemic risks and ensure the stability of the financial system as a whole. This may include setting counter-cyclical capital buffers, which require banks to hold additional capital during economic upturns, or implementing restrictions on credit growth that could lead to asset price bubbles. Thirdly, it is essential to diversify and strengthen the financial system through encouraging the growth of alternative financial institutions such as credit unions and development banks. These institutions can provide additional sources of financing for businesses, reducing the dependency on traditional banks and making the overall financial system more resilient to shocks. Fourthly, implementing reforms to the banking sector's corporate governance is vital. This includes ensuring that banks have effective and independent boards that can hold management accountable for their actions and safeguard shareholders' interests. Additionally, implementing robust risk management practices can help banks better identify and manage potential risks related to their activities, thereby reducing their potential exposure to crises. Fifthly, fostering international cooperation and coordination among regulators and central banks can help develop a unified response to potential banking crises, allowing countries to learn from each other's experiences and share best practices. This cooperation can also help in developing and implementing early warning systems that can monitor potential vulnerabilities and prompt timely policy actions to avoid the emergence of new crises. Finally, it is important to ensure that consumers and investors are protected from financial fraud and predatory practices by establishing effective consumer protection frameworks and promoting financial education to raise awareness of potential risks. In sum, working towards preventing future banking crises requires a multifaceted approach that involves regulatory and supervisory reforms, macroprudential policies, diversification of the financial system, improvements in corporate governance, international cooperation, and consumer protection. By implementing these measures, we can build a more resilient and stable financial system, ensuring that we do not experience another significant banking crisis as the one we're going through right now."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bill O'Reilly: More proof that the left-wing media are blatantly dishonest Before he died, Andrew Breitbart spoke to \\"The Hollywood Reporter.\\" That was the last interview he ever did. Mr. Breitbart was upset because he believed the left-wing media was trying to destroy him. He pointed to Media Matters as the primary offender. Breitbart went on to accuse the far-left web site of receiving orders from the Democratic National Committee and directly passing those orders on to MSNBC. The blogger called it a rigged operation and was furious that a news agency as powerful as NBC would engage in dishonest practices. Now, for years \\"Talking Points\\" has been telling you that Media Matters, heavily funded by people like George Soros, has been corrupting the editorial process in America. And tonight we will give you one more vivid example. As you may know, I have been very critical of the oil companies jacking up gas prices when there's plenty of supply available in the U.S.A. Also, I've criticized President Obama for doing nothing about it when he could call the oil chieftains into the White House and get behind legislation to limit oil speculation. Enter Media Matters who calls me a hypocrite because they say I didn't hammer President Bush when gas prices rose during his tenure. Here is what Media Matters ran on its web site: O'REILLY: So the next time you hear a politician say he or she will bring down oil prices, understand its complete BS. If Americans want lower gas prices? Cut back. O'REILLY: Now Media Matters posted that clip nine days ago but they dishonestly edited it. Here is the full clip. O'REILLY: The Republican Party pretty much lets big oil do whatever it wants and refuses to rein in corrupt speculators who drive up the price of oil. So the next time you hear a politician say he or she will bring down oil prices? Understand its complete BS. If Americans want lower gas prices? Cut back. O'REILLY: I believe President Bush is a Republican, is he not? So, Media Matters lied as it always does. It takes video clips out of context every single day. And guess who went wild calling me hypocritical? NBC News in the form of MSNBC. I know, you’re shocked. Here is the bigger picture. We know that most of the media is actively rooting for President Obama to be re-elected. But it used to be that the liberal press just tilted coverage ignoring stories that reflected positively on conservatives and Republicans and hyping stories that help Democrats and liberals. But now… now national news agencies are actually lying to you, using out of context quotes that they get from web sites and fabricating things all in an effort to advance the liberal agenda. Later in this broadcast, you'll hear conservative Rick Santorum criticize Fox News for not helping him out… interesting. So the next time you hear Fox News is a right-wing operation, just mention Rick Santorum's contention. The danger here is that the presidential election will not be reported honestly. And that Americans who do not pay close attention will be deceived and therefore, their vote unfairly influenced. That's on them, of course, you can't force people to be fair and wise. But if Andrew Breitbart's contention is true, that the Democratic Party is now coordinating with Media Matters, who is coordinating with MSNBC, that is troubling and a blatant corruption of the First Amendment. Not easy being a celebrity in America. Everybody's got a camera; everybody's looking at you. Sometimes bad things can happen. Conservative author Jason Mattera walked up to comedian Chris Rock and -- well -- roll the tape. JASON MATTERA, AUTHOR: Big fan. Grew up in Brooklyn. How's it going. Can I take a picture with you? MATTERA: When you... when you said the Tea Party was insane and racist... O'REILLY: All right. Now, Mr. Mattera is a \\"Pinhead\\" because he misrepresented himself. I mean, Rock was kind enough to give him the picture. And then he turns around, and he ambushes him. You don't want to do that, all right? And even though he reacted poorly, I can't call Mr. Rock a \\"Pinhead\\", because that stuff has happened to me, and I don't always react in the best way. I just wish civility would take hold in this country. We don't need to do this stuff. All right?

Wi-Fi or WiFi () is a technology for wireless local area networking with devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. \\"Wi-Fi\\" is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term \\"Wi-Fi Certified\\" to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing. Devices that can use Wi-Fi technology include personal computers, video-game consoles, phones and tablets, digital cameras, smart TVs, digital audio players and modern printers. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via a WLAN and a wireless access point. Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about indoors and a greater range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the UHF and SHF ISM radio bands. Having no physical connections, it is more vulnerable to attack than wired connections, such as twisted pair. In 1971, ALOHAnet connected the Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network. ALOHAnet and the ALOHA protocol were early forerunners to Ethernet, and later the IEEE 802.11 protocols, respectively.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: I recall my mother's voice which called me to order, and often ended with some strong proverb to express the gravity of the wrong done. It was common practice for my mother to send me off soul-searching with a proverb. Of the many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out with clarity. I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel. I did not manage to hide my feelings from my mother, and after serving the group, she called me to the balcony, where she usually sat to attend to her sewing . Looking straight into my eyes, she said, \\"Tsholofelo, why were you so unhappy when I requested you to prepare a meal for those poor people?\\" Despite my attempt to deny her allegation , and using the heat of the fire and the sun as an excuse for my alleged behavior, Mother, giving me a firm look, said, \\"A foot has no nose.\\" It means, \\"You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.\\" Had I denied the group of people a meal, it may have happened that, in my travels some time in the future, I found myself at the mercy of those very individuals. As if that was not enough to shame me, Mother continued, \\"A person is a person because of another person.\\" The answer is:","completion":"Question: According to the article, what was the proverb told by the mother to teach her child a lesson and what was its implication? A) \\"A foot has no nose.\\" - You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you. B) \\"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\\" - Better to have a lesser but certain advantage than the possibility of a greater one that may come to nothing. C) \\"Every cloud has a silver lining.\\" - Every difficult or sad situation has a comforting or more hopeful aspect, even though this may not be immediately apparent. D) \\"You cannot have your cake and eat it too.\\" - You can't use or have something up and then still possess or keep it.

The article then explains the meaning of this proverb which is \\"You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.\\" - Considering this, I formulated the question to ask what proverb the mother used and what its implication was. - For the false options in the multi-choice question, I selected commonly known proverbs and their meanings that did not match the context of the story to create a clear contrast with the correct answer. - The correct answer focuses on the essence of the proverb used in the original text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will happen to Casey?\\", is \\"unimportant\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, \\"unimportant\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Casey?\\" because it doesn't provide any information or context about the situation or possible outcomes. Rather, it contradicts the purpose of the question, which is to seek clarification or predict the consequences of a particular action (in this case, Sasha putting Casey on hold). A valid answer to this question should consider various factors such as the reason for Sasha putting Casey on hold, the length of time Casey may be put on hold, and the relationship between Sasha and Casey. It should also take into consideration the context in which the call was initiated, the subject of the conversation, and Casey's likely reaction to being put on hold. For example, a more informative answer to the question could be: If Sasha puts Casey on hold for a short period of time to attend to another urgent call, Casey may stay on the line and patiently wait for Sasha to return. In this case, there may not be any major consequences, especially if the conversation was informal or about a matter that is not time-sensitive. On the other hand, if Sasha puts Casey on hold for a long period of time, leaves the call without any explanation, or if the conversation was about a critical or sensitive issue, Casey may become frustrated or irritated. Casey could hang up the call and potentially feel upset, leading to misunderstandings or conflicts in their relationship. Alternatively, Casey might also use this waiting time to multitask, like checking their emails or attending to other tasks, and may or may not be bothered by being put on hold. The impact of being put on hold would depend on the individual's personality, patience level, and perception of the situation. In some cases, the consequences of Sasha putting Casey on hold may be determined by external factors as well. For instance, if this call was a part of a professional setting and Casey was urgently required to make a decision or provide information, then being put on hold could lead to delays in decision-making, missed opportunities, or miscommunication among team members. In conclusion, providing a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Casey?\\" requires context and elaboration on various factors to give a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes. Using a term like \\"unimportant\\" does not contribute valuable information and is therefore not a valid answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done. Question: suppose good climate conditions happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER nests. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"The occurrence of good climate conditions can have a direct impact on bird nesting behavior, particularly on the size and number of nests. In favorable climates, we could observe both more and smaller nests as birds enjoy an abundance of food and suitable habitats. The given process of nest building may be influenced by these beneficial conditions as well. Firstly, let's discuss how good climate conditions can lead to an increased number of nests. Favorable climate conditions can promote a greater abundance of food resources such as insects, seeds, and fruits, which are critical to bird survival and reproduction. Birds that have access to abundant food resources are more likely to breed successfully and produce more offspring. As a result, the need for nests will increase as birds need safe and comfortable spaces for laying eggs and raising their young. Secondly, it is also essential to consider how these favorable conditions might affect the size of the nests. Under good climate conditions, birds will have access to more nesting materials, such as twigs, leaves, and other natural debris. Additionally, there will likely be less competition for nesting spots among birds, reducing the need for large nests as a way to ward off potential rivals or intruders. This availability of nesting materials and space can lead to a trend towards smaller nests, as birds will be more capable of building and maintaining smaller nests without compromising their offspring's safety or comfort. Now, let's delve into the second part of the question - the influence of this supposed perturbation on the second effect mentioned, which is the trend towards smaller nests. Given that the good climate conditions encourage birds to build both a greater number of nests and smaller nests, it can be concluded that there would be a direct correlation between the two effects. This means that the perturbation - the favorable climate conditions - will have a greater effect on the second effect mentioned, smaller nests. The abundance of nesting materials in good climate conditions will make it easier for birds to construct a smaller nest while still retaining the necessary structural integrity and safety for their offspring. In conclusion, the occurrence of good climate conditions will likely have both more and smaller nests as a result of increased food resources, availability of nesting materials, and diminished competition for nesting sites. The impact of the favorable climate conditions has a more significant effect on the second effect mentioned, leading to smaller nests for birds to raise their offspring. The birds will be more capable of building and maintaining these smaller nests, making it a more viable option for their reproductive needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Still looking for their first win of the season, the Bengals went home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played a Week 9 duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars. In the first quarter, Cincinnati clawed first as QB Ryan Fitzpatrick completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Chad Ocho Cinco. In the second quarter, the Bengals increased their lead as Fitzpatrick hooked up with Ocho Cinco again on a 10-yard TD pass. The Jaguars would end the half on kicker Josh Scobee's 52-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued its hot streak as RB Cedric Benson got a 7-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Jacksonville began to rally as Scobee nailed a 26-yard field goal, FB Montell Owens returned the fumbled kickoff 18 yards for a touchdown, and RB Maurice Jones-Drew got a 1-yard TD pass. Fortunately, the Bengals' defense prevented the Jaguars from getting the 2-point conversion, allowing Cincinnati to finally get its first win of the season.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

Q:How much can environment affect intelligence? In one study, striking increases in IQ occurred in 25 children who were moved from an orphanage to more stimulating(,) environments.The children, who were all considered mentally retarded and unadoptable, were moved to an institution where they received personal attention from adults.Later, these supposedly retarded children were adopted by parents who gave them love, a family ,and a stimulating home environment.The children gained an average of 29 IQ points.For one child, the increase was an amazing 58 points.A second group of initially less \\"retarded\\" children, who stayed in the orphanage, lost an average of 26 IQ points. Other encouraging results can be found in early childhood education programs, which provide stimulating intellectual experiences for disadvantaged children.In one study, children from low-income families were given enriched environments from early infancy through preschool.By age 2 their IQ scores were already higher than those in a control group.More important, they were still 5 points higher seven years later.High-quality enrichment programs such as Head Start can prevent children from falling behind in school. A particularly striking environmental effect is the fact that 14 nations have shown average IQ gains of from 5 to 25 points during the last 30 years.These IQ boosts, averaging 15 points, occurred in far too short a time for genetics to explain them.It is more likely that the gains reflect environmental forces, such as improved education, nutrition, and living in a technologically complex society. Which of the following is NOT mentioned as an environmental factor that affects IQ _ . A) Good nutrition. B) Improved technology. C) Better education. D) Food pollution. A:","completion":"D) Food pollution is NOT mentioned as an environmental factor that affects IQ. The environmental factors that are mentioned include good nutrition, improved technology, and better education. These factors contribute to an individual's intelligence and may have a significant impact on their cognitive development. In some cases, such as the study mentioned, children who were moved from orphanages to more stimulating environments experienced significant increases in their IQ scores. Early childhood education programs that provide intellectually stimulating experiences for disadvantaged children can also lead to an increase in IQ scores over time. These enrichment programs, such as Head Start, can prevent children from falling behind in school and help to bridge the gap in cognitive development between children from low-income families and their more privileged peers. Additionally, IQ gains in 14 nations over the last 30 years, ranging from 5 to 25 points, suggest that environmental forces, such as improved education, nutrition, and living in a technologically complex society, play a significant role in affecting intelligence. These environmental factors may contribute to cognitive growth and development, far beyond what genetic factors alone can achieve. In conclusion, while genetics play an important role in determining an individual's intelligence, environmental factors such as good nutrition, improved technology, and better education can have a significant impact on a person's IQ as well. Therefore, efforts should be made to create conducive environments that foster cognitive growth and development, particularly for disadvantaged children who may not have access to the same resources as their more privileged peers. In doing so, we can help to create a more equitable and intellectually rich society for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The city was gray but the buildings contrasted with dirt red. The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones. Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either. I had no leads but I knew I could go to a library and maybe find out her number if she had listed it on Facebook, so I kept walking. Stopping at benches, I would rest until I could muster more energy. Question: Why was the air cool and prepped with moisture?

In week 4, the Lions traveled south to Arlington, Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys dominated the first half, putting the Lions in a big hole for the second straight week. First came a 25-yard touchdown catch by Dez Bryant. In the second quarter, Bryant scored again on a 6-yard touchdown catch. Dallas added more points with a 41-yard field goal by Dan Bailey. The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime. After the break, Dallas added more points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, putting them up 27-3. The Lions responded with two consecutive defensive touchdowns: first a 34-yard interception return by Bobby Carpenter, then a 56-yard pick-6 by Chris Houston. The Cowboys scored their final points of the game with a 23-yard field goal late in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions continued their comeback with a 23-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson. They made it a three-point game with a 51-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, then Romo threw an interception to Stephen Tulloch, and took their first lead of the game late in the final quarter when Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 2 yards out to become only the second player in NFL history to record at least two touchdown catches in 4 straight games (the other to do so is former Vikings receiver Cris Carter). The Lions defense held off Dallas for the win. Like the previous week, the Lions came back and won it in the final moments of the game after being down by a large margin at halftime. This was also the largest comeback the Dallas Cowboys have ever allowed, and it is the largest comeback by a road team in NFL history as the Cowboys were up by 24 in the 3rd quarter.

According to netball rules, you can only shoot when you're inside this portion of the court, which includes the line that marks the circle. Align your body with the netball post, with your feet and hips shoulder distance apart and facing forward. Available choices: +This provides as much room as possible to shoot accurately. Make sure your eyes are fully closed when you're shooting.. +Proper balance is key to an accurate netball shot, so be sure that your weight is distributed evenly between both feet. Hold the netball with your dominant hand.. +Aim toward the basket while the other team shoots. Defend the court at the five-foot mark.. +Your right arm should point up through the air. There are 200 methods to shoot in netball, so you can search online or come up with one that suits you..","completion":"Proper balance is key to an accurate netball shot, so be sure that your weight is distributed evenly between both feet. Hold the netball with your dominant hand. After positioning yourself properly inside the shooting semicircle and aligning your body with the netball post, it's time to focus on your balance and grip. Distributing your weight evenly between your feet prevents you from losing balance in the middle of the shot and affecting your shooting accuracy. This stability will also give you confidence when taking the shot. Use your dominant hand to hold the netball. Your fingers should be spread wide, creating a comfortable grip on the ball. The ball should not be touching your palm; instead, it should rest on your fingertips for better control. Your non-dominant hand should be on the side of the ball, helping you stabilize it and guide it during the shot. Next, focus on your shooting technique. Extend your shooting arm upwards with your elbow slightly bent, forming an \\"L\\" shape. Your shooting hand should be facing the net, with your wrist flicking forward as you release the ball. This flicking motion will generate backspin on the ball, making it travel straighter and giving it a softer touch when it reaches the hoop. While doing this, your non-dominant hand should remain steady and away from the ball, allowing your dominant hand to smoothly guide the shot. Maintain a consistent shooting routine to refine and perfect your technique. The more you practice, the more you'll develop muscle memory, which will contribute to your overall accuracy in netball. Concentrate on your stance, balance, grip, and shooting mechanics, and always be mindful of your body position. Finally, remember that every player has their own unique shooting style. While the above tips apply to most players, it's essential to pay attention to your own strengths and weaknesses and make adjustments as needed. By dedicating time to practice and analyze your performance, you'll be able to improve your shooting accuracy and become a more skilled and well-rounded netball player."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

McCain responds angrily to report on drones Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) sharply criticized congressional appropriators Thursday for secretly slipping language into the omnibus spending bill that preserves the CIA’s role in lethal counterterrorism operations. McCain was responding to a report in Thursday's Washington Post that revealed that Congress is on the verge of blocking President Obama’s plan to shift control of the U.S. drone campaign from the CIA to the Defense Department. The measure, buried within the 1,500-page, 1.1 trillion federal budget plan, would restrict the use of any funding to transfer unmanned aircraft or the authority to carry out drone strikes from the CIA to the Pentagon, officials said. Waving around a copy of The Post while speaking on the Senate floor, McCain blasted his colleagues on the Senate and House Appropriations committee for making such a key decision without formally and publicly consulting the authorizing committees for the CIA and Defense Department. “The Appropriations Committee has no business making these decisions,\\" he said. \\"The job of the Armed Services Committee and the job of the Intelligence Committee is to authorize these things. There was no hearing on the Intelligence Committee. There was no hearing on the Armed Services Committee.\\" \\"The appropriations have gotten into the business of the authorizing committees,\\" he added later. \\"That is a violation of every procedure and process that this Senate is supposed to be pursuing.\\" Indeed, the provision regarding drones is an unusually direct intervention by lawmakers into the way covert operations are run and will likley impede the administration's plans to return the CIA’s focus to traditional intelligence gathering and possibly bringing more transparency to drone strikes.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the city that was bombed in the Bristol Blitz? Bristol, the largest city in South West England, has an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church. The construction of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.The 20th century saw further expansion of the city, the growth of the University of Bristol and the arrival of the aircraft industry. During World War II, the city centre was extensively bombed in the Bristol Blitz. The redevelopment of shopping centres, office buildings, and the harbourside continues to this day.

Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A Nigerian man who sang in a Vatican choir arranged gay liaisons for an Italian government official who served in the unpaid role of papal usher, according to transcripts of wiretaps collected by Italian authorities. The wiretaps were gathered as part of an investigation into how public-works contracts were awarded. The purported conversations were between Angelo Balducci, who oversaw the Italian government's awarding of construction contracts -- including work on the airport at Perugia -- and Thomas Chinedu Ehiem, a 39-year-old Nigerian singer. They were recorded between April 14, 2008, and January 20, 2010. In addition to working for the government, Balducci served as a \\"gentleman of his holiness,\\" also known as a papal usher or \\"Vatican gentleman.\\" The main responsibility of the ceremonial position is to welcome heads of state to the Vatican and escort them to see the Pope. Balducci is one of three public officials who, along with a businessman, have been jailed on charges related to corruption in the public works department. The public officials are alleged to have awarded contracts to businessmen who offered them favors, money, sex, and/or house remodeling in exchange. The suspects, who deny the charges, are in \\"cautionary custody\\" though they have not been charged or indicted.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - anger - nodding - listening - take notes - writing down Answer:","completion":"The clicking away of a shorthand typewriter was taking notes while hearing testimony. When a testimony is given during a legal proceeding or any formal event, it is important to document the statements and information shared by the witnesses and participants. A shorthand typewriter, which was commonly used before the advent of modern technology, served as an effective tool for transcribing spoken words into written form rapidly and accurately. Shorthand typewriting is a specialized skill that involves the use of a particular typewriter and a unique shorthand writing system. This system is designed to capture words and phrases as they are spoken, using a set of abbreviations and symbols for common words and letter combinations. A skilled shorthand typist can type at speeds similar to the pace of normal speech, ensuring that important details are not missed during the recording process. The transcription created by the shorthand typewriter during the testimony serves multiple purposes, such as: 1. Documentation: A formal record of the testimony helps attorneys, judges, and other legal professionals refer back to the statements and evidence presented during the proceedings. 2. Analysis: Legal professionals may need to review the transcribed testimony to build their case, identify inconsistencies in statements or evidence, and decide on the best course of action in the future. 3. Appeals and Legal Precedent: Testimonies transcribed by shorthand typewriters can be referenced in potential appeals, as well as in future cases that may involve similar legal issues or arguments, thereby shaping the legal landscape. In conclusion, the clicking away of a shorthand typewriter during a testimony serves the critical function of taking notes and preserving an accurate record of the spoken words. This detailed and valuable document can then be used by legal professionals and others involved in the proceedings for various purposes, such as analyzing the case, preparing for future hearings or appeals, and establishing legal precedents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have no idea how a Texan (the director, Douglas McGrath) and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about Ms. Paltrow was in the first place! I had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her Oscar-winning \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" performance but she gets all the beats right here--she is nigh on perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare but she should be remembered for this.Of course, she's surrounded by a great supporting cast including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson et al...Jeremy Northam is very appealing as the love interest, even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to Paltrow (in the process, allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship); several years on, Ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and, personally, I find puckish Alan Cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays. But the standout is, without a doubt, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; what this version needs is a scene where Emma reconciles with Miss Bates, as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn. The film is worth watching (again even) for her performance alone.All in all, this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the British class system.

In 2004, Bonds had perhaps his best season. He hit .362 en route to his second National League batting title, and broke his own record by walking 232 times. He slugged .812, which was fourth-highest of all time, and broke his on-base percentage record with a .609 average. Bonds passed Mays on the career home run list by hitting his 661st off of Ben Ford (baseball) on April 13, He then hit his 700th off of Jake Peavy on September 17. Bonds hit 45 home runs in 373 at-bats, and struck out just 41 times, putting himself in elite company, as few major leaguers have ever had more home runs than strikeouts in a season. Bonds would win his fourth consecutive MVP award and his seventh overall. His seven MVP awards are four more than any other player in history. In addition, no other player from either league has been awarded the MVP four times in a row. (The MVP award was first given in 1931). The 40-year-old Bonds also broke Willie Stargells 25-year record as the oldest player to win a Most Valuable Player Award (Stargell, at 39 years, 8 months, was National League co-MVP with Keith Hernandez in 1979).

Here are 30 Ways Retiring early might seem like a pipe dream, but it’s not — if you know what steps you need to take, that is. But don’t think you can work today and just retire tomorrow. Instead, implement the following tips to amp up your retirement savings, cut spending and find extra sources of income. Check out these 30 tips on how to retire early. While these retirement tips can help support your early retirement goals, you need a strategy to get you there. Figure out what it will cost for you to get into an early retirement and how much cash you will need to comfortably live on. A solid plan can help direct all your actions toward reaching the goal of an earlier retirement, and hopefully with less stress. Read More: 35 Retirement Planning Mistakes People Make Less spending later constitutes the flip side of less spending now. If you imagine a comfy retirement as a vacation home and monthly cruise ship trips, revisit that vision so you don’t have to bleed cash but can still retire in style. Instead of two homes, for example, why not live in your favorite vacation destination and pocket the principal from selling your primary residence? If you’re not sure where to start but know you have more to learn, take classes on fiscal responsibility, investing and saving. There are numerous financial advisors and consumer education sources that offer classes and literature — online and offline — that can help you learn more so you can make better decisions. No matter what age you are, don’t wait to get started on saving for an early retirement. It’s easy to get caught up today and forget about what tomorrow brings. The longer you wait, the longer it will be until you can comfortably retire. Sorry, folks: Simply skipping that 4 latte in the morning ain’t gonna cut it. It takes a much more committed approach where “sacrifices” are viewed in a new light. “It’s amazing when I work through the numbers that some people think manicures, landscapers and maids are a need,” said Michael Chadwick, a certified financial planner and CEO of Chadwick Financial Advisors in Unionville, Conn. That’s right, all of it. First: Is it time to pay off your home? You might not have the resources now to plunk down one huge check, but consider savvy alternatives such as switching from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage. Second: Do the same with loans and credit cards, as high interest eats up income fast. Once you get rid of your debt, do everything in your power to avoid falling back into it. Don’t rely on credit to get by or use your credit card to splurge on an item you know you can’t really afford. If you overspend and carry a balance, you will be tied to paying off the debts plus interest when you could be saving that money for retirement instead. While it’s risky to count on unknowns such as an inheritance, you might have cash streams available outside the traditional retirement realm, said Jennifer E. Acuff, principal wealth advisor with TrueWealth Management in Atlanta. For example, “Understand your options with respect to any pensions you might be entitled to from current or previous employers,” she said. If you’re in your 20s and start investing now, you’re in luck, said Joseph Jennings Jr., investment director for PNC Wealth Management in Maryland. “Due to the power of compounding, the first dollar saved is the most important, as it has the most growth potential over time,” he said. As an example, Jennings compared 10,000 saved at age 25 versus 60. “The 25-year-old has 40 years of growth potential at the average retirement age of 65, whereas 10,000 saved at age 60 only has five years of growth potential.” Calculator: How much will I need to save for retirement? The wisdom of taking advantage of a company match on the 401k is well established — but think about how that power is accelerated if a working couple does it with two such company matches. “If your employer has a matching contribution inside of your company’s plan, make sure you always contribute at least enough to receive it,” said Kevin J. Meehan, regional president-Chicago with Wealth Enhancement Group. “You are essentially leaving money on the table if you don’t.” The methodology is simple, yet the results can be profound: Put money into monthly, systematic investments during your working years. “There’s no other element of investment planning or portfolio management that’s more essential over the long term,” said Jesse Mackey, chief investment officer of 4Thought Financial Group in Syosset, N.Y. How about some free money? The ESPP typically works by payroll deduction, with the company converting the money into shares every six months at a 15 percent discount. “If you immediately liquidate those shares every time they’re delivered, it’s like you get a guaranteed 15 percent rate of return,” said Dave Yeske, managing director at the wealth management firm Yeske Buie and director of the financial planning program at Golden Gate University. “Add the after-tax proceeds to your supplemental retirement savings.” Whether you choose to open an IRA, Roth IRA, 401k or Roth 401k, it’s important to choose a retirement vehicle that not only grows your savings, but also provides tax benefits. Don’t just rely on a savings account. There’s no sense in depriving yourself of every single thing, especially well-deserved time off. But Yeske points out that you can save a ton in 150 countries through a service called HomeExchange.com, which helps you “exchange” homes or apartments all over the world. “My wife and I have stayed for free in London, Amsterdam, New York and Costa Rica,” he said. “And when you’re staying in someone’s home or apartment, you don’t have to eat out at a restaurant for every meal, so your food costs nothing more than if you were at home.” To get to an early retirement, you have to periodically revisit your IRA, 401k or other retirement account to make sure your money doesn’t grow cobwebs. For example, the way your retirement account is diversified shouldn’t put too much emphasis on low-yield investments — such as money market funds and low-yielding bonds. “Dividends can pile up in the money market account, typically earning one one-hundredth of a percent,” Yeske said. “Make sure your cash is invested properly.” In this curse of consumerism, you buy something expensive, feel excited and then scout for something else to purchase when the “new car smell” wears off. And it’s a huge trap if you want an early retirement, said Pete, a finance blogger who retired in his 30s. Another advantage: “Here in the rich world,” he wrote for MrMoneyMustache.com, “the only widespread form of slavery is the economic type.” Early retirement doesn’t necessarily mean retiring all of your income, especially if you find ways to bring in money without hard work. Investing in rental properties is one way you can create a cash flow stream — and you can minimize the labor by hiring a property manager. Or, set up an internet sales business, and hire a part-timer to fulfill orders and track stock based on volume. By serving in the military, you can also serve yourself. Members commonly retire after 20 years, living off generous pensions and health insurance. Although members of the military should expect 401k-style retirement plans in the future, an earlier-than-normal retirement should still remain an option for many men and women. Not only does eating out cost considerably more than cooking for yourself at home, it also tends to involve more calories, sodium and fat that do not contribute to your well-being. Instead, planning and creating batch-style meals can cut your costs. Even creating a garden for some vegetables can help reduce your food bill, which means you should have more money to put in your retirement savings to help you retire early. Although you might be busy, it can make more fiscal sense to do certain things around the home yourself. This means no maid service, gardener or pool technician. While paying for these services are convenient, they might be draining you of potential retirement savings. Look at what household expenses you could reasonably cut, and channel that money into your retirement fund. An added bonus: You could even get in better shape as you take on more of these responsibilities. Also, you get the satisfaction from doing the work yourself. If you want to retire early, you need to cut back on some of your overpriced luxuries and services. Of course, it’s important to allow yourself a balanced life — making time for entertainment, exercise, friends, family and so on. However, there are things you can do to cut back on expensive monthly services, such as cable TV, internet and phone. Instead, look for alternatives like new on-demand streaming services and affordable mobile phone plans. Read More: 10 Ways Retirement Will Change in 2016 Instead of pursuing hobbies that cost a lot of money because they require lessons and a lot of equipment, stick to activities that nature provides for free — and put those savings toward your early retirement. Some popular outdoor activities that you can enjoy on the cheap include taking a walk, hiking or riding a bike. Or, go tent camping rather than taking an expensive vacation. While you love your car, it’s probably costing you a significant amount of money in terms of the gas and maintenance, as well as the initial investment and ongoing car payments. If you live in an area that allows you to depend less on a car, take advantage of it. Find opportunities to walk or ride a bike. Or, take public transportation whenever possible, and reap the benefits of healthier and more cost-effective living. Get off the couch, and do things that remind you of your mission to retire early. Although you don’t want to waste money on activities you can do for free, it’s OK to splurge a little on certain excursions and lessons — especially if they keep you motivated to retire early. So plan a cruise this summer, take up some golf lessons or treat yourself to a spa day. Many early retirees and successful people in general will tell you that staying positive helped keep them on the right track to accomplishing their goals. People who stay positive are also less likely to become ill and are better able to cope with hardship and stress, according to the Mayo Clinic. As corny as it might sound, this positivity could keep you from overspending and help you stick to your early retirement goal. With each choice you make, ask yourself if your decision will make you happy. Impulses can lead to poor choices and bad spending habits. So, always think about how your everyday decisions can impact your life goals.

Never put saving for your child’s college tuition over saving for your retirement — this is especially true if you’re determined to retire early. With tuition costing tens of thousands of dollars over four years, it can take a big chunk out of your early retirement savings fund. Instead, focus on saving for retirement first and help your kid apply for scholarships, grants, work-study and part-time jobs to help offset college costs. Some middle agers are selling the bulk of their possessions — including their homes — and moving into tricked-out tiny houses, mobile homes and houseboats.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague.

UPDATED:. 22:39 EST, 8 January 2014. Lara Bingle's best friend Vicki Lee has sparked rumours that the Australian model and her boyfriend Sam Worthington have tied the knot by posting a cryptic Instagram snap on Wednesday. In the image, Lara is seen standing at a wedding altar on a Western Australian beach, wearing a black bikini. Lee also captioned the picture: 'Here comes the bride, all dressed in bikini'. Wedding fever: Lara Bingle's best friend Vicki Lee has sparked rumours that the model has married boyfriend Sam Worthington by posting this snap of the star standing at a wedding altar. The setting couldn't be anymore stunning, with the 26-year-old posing in front of a backdrop of crystal blue water. Several white chairs are set up on the sand as well as flowers and a makeshift altar made out of bamboo and swathed in white fabric. After Vicki posted the image, Lara joked in a comment underneath:: 'It's vicki and my wedding :)' Romantic outing: Lara and Sam were last seen together over the weekend when they went shopping and enjoyed lunch in Perth. Romantic meal: The couple enjoyed a meal at burger joint Grill'd in Scarborough Beach. On Thursday afternoon, Lara re tweeted a post from Who magazine's Twitter page. '@MsLaraBingle is not or has not married Sam Worthington in a beach ceremony, her rep confirms to @WHOmagazine,' it read. Lara and Sam have been inseparable over the past few months after meeting at the Cotton On Foundation's Global Citizen Concert headlined by Bono, Kings of Leon, Stevie Wonder and Alicia Keys at Central Park back in September. As an ambassador to the brand, Lara was guest of honour, and was joined by Sam, Natalie Imbruglia and Scott Eastwood for the charity music event. According to onlookers, 'sparks flew' between the pair during the concert, and they soon were seeing the sights of NYC and later Paris and other cities around Europe together. Inseparable: The happy couple also spent Christmas together and were snapped on the 23rd of December again in Sam's home state. Sam clearly likes to date women from his home country as he briefly dated Aussie singer and actress Sophie Monk this year, and before that was in a relationship with Australian bartender Crystal Humphries. Meanwhile, Lara was formerly engaged to Australian Cricket Captain Michael Clarke, but she most recently dated fashion designer Gareth Moody, 35, and then New York DJ Nick Cohen. Lara is currently in Western Australia spending time with Sam while he films his new movie, Paper Planes. Friends at sea: Lara enjoyed a cruise around Rottnest Island in WA with gal pals Emmi Moore and Nadia Rosa on Monday. The Avatar star grew up in Perth before making it big in the film industry and he spends a lot of his time these days Stateside. It was recently announced that the 37-year-old actor will reprise his role as Jake Sully in James Cameron's long-awaited Avatar sequel. The movie will start shooting in New Zealand next year, with a tentative release date set for 2016. So in love: Lara and Sam have been posting several romantic snaps of one another on their Instagram pages of late. Cute: The pair have only been dating for a few months, but are clearly smitten. Avatar was the highest-grossing film in history and made 2.7 billion worldwide, along with winning three Academy Awards. Cameron has already revealed he has 'an idea for a fourth' movie in the franchise and said the forthcoming motion picture will tell the story of the 'early expeditions' on the moon Pandora. He told MTV News: 'Basically it goes back to the early expeditions of Pandora, and kind of what went wrong with the humans and the Na'vi and what that was like to be an explorer and living in that world. Earlier this week, Lara was seen spending time on a 30m super yacht, cruising around Rottnest Island with good gal pals Emmi Moore and Nadia Rosa. Best pals: Lara's other love of her life is her best friend Vicki Lee, who posted the cryptic snap. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Given the question: Article: Early one morning, more than a hundred years ago, an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep. He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day.

Remember that fee comparisons aren't created equal.The two most debated aspects of 401(k) plans are breadth of investment offerings and the fees associated with those offerings. Blanchett said complaints about investment options are on the wane, rightly so. \\"Most plans are OK there, and to be honest, the things that are missing are the ones people won't realize they are missing.\\" Fees, though, continue to be a bone of contention in the retirement plan market. There's just one very important thing to remember if an employee does want to discuss fees with their employer: You have to compare the fees on your plan to fees on similarly-sized plans. Sure, in a perfect world it wouldn't matter if you worked for Exxon Mobil or a local grocery store in terms of the competitiveness of plan fees, but the truth is, it makes all the difference in the world: The larger the plan is, the better it can negotiate with vendors for lower-fee investment offerings. \\"When someone tells me they think their 401(k) fees are too high, I always ask, 'Compared to what?'\\" Adams said. When an online financial tool is suggesting that you're paying too high a fee, know what the basis of comparison is. It's not just size. Are there fees or services you have access to in your plan but aren't using? Remember the wider demographic of the plan: Sometimes you might pay for a certain service that is part of the package and one that is of value to the plan as a whole, Adams said. \\"There are legitimate complaints,\\" Johnson said, but he again stressed being an educated complainer. \\"When I meet with individual clients, my advice to them if they want to have this conversation with the boss is to go in and offer solutions. If you go on BrightScope and it says your plan fees are high compared to the average, then go in and say, 'Hey, here is what Fidelity will come in and offer, and here is what Vanguard will do.\\" 6. Understanding the chess match of the company match.A company match pegged to an employee contribution is one of the best benefits of a 401(k)—Blanchett said research shows it improves participant behavior—but it is at the discretion of the employer. For many small-business employers, the company match was a feature that became a casualty of the recession. Now that business in America is booming again, have all those rescinded matches come back? The experts say no, and that's one delicate conversation that employees of small firms have every right to seek out with their bosses. \\"We're quite a few years removed from the crisis, and if a plan has not added [the match] back, if I'm that person, I would ask: 'It was in here before. Why isn't it back?'\\" Blanchett said. \\"The biggest complaint we get is that there is no match or the company cut down on match. That's No. 1,\\" Johnson said. Even big public companies cut back on the match, and at companies of 50 or less employees, the issue is widespread, he said. \\"Five years ago, people didn't know if they would survive and now are a little out of survival mode and asking where does the business invest,\\" Johnson said. \\"They could invest more in the 401(k), and it's an easy thing to do.\\" Of course, easier said than done. \\"The reality is it's a form of confrontation,\\" Blanchett said. But it's also a negotiation: Even if the employer does not agree to restart the company match, it's possible they could offer an employee a pay raise to make up for it. Johnson said another potential negotiation is with employers who feel bad about cutting a match, and even if they won't bring it back yet, they might be more willing to listen to employee suggestions for lower-fee 401(k) plans to switch over to. \\"That's where you have to have a mature conversation and put yourself in the shoes of the other person, sniff out whether the boss is being greedy or really having a hard time keeping the doors open,\\" Johnson said. He said it is also important to remember that in many cases, employers may have simply lost sight of the match relative to all of the other issues they deal with as business recovers. Sometimes it's not that they are thinking of the cost, it's just that they don't have the time to think about it at all. \\"I have the conversation with a lot of bosses who own a dental or medical practice or small manufacturing or sales company—the core of our economy, with 15 to 50 employees—and they are just busy folks and often haven't thought about any of these issues long enough to implement solutions,\\" Johnson said. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text discuss how to talk to an employer about your 401(k) with a focus on comparing fees and understanding the company match. 1. Comparing fees: It is important to compare the fees on your 401(k) plan to fees on similarly-sized plans. Knowing the basis of comparison when discussing fees with your employer is crucial. Be an educated complainer and offer solutions by suggesting alternatives like Fidelity or Vanguard. 2. Understanding the company match: The company match is a major benefit of a 401(k) plan but is at the discretion of the employer. Many small businesses removed the match feature during the recession, and not all have reinstated it. Employees of these companies can approach their bosses and ask why the match hasn't been reinstated. Keep in mind that employers may have lost sight of the match amid other business recovery priorities, so having a mature conversation about it can lead to potential negotiations for lower-fee 401(k) plans or salary raises for employees."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What of many of them have been destroyed? Movie plot title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her...

In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself. Want to know how often the exercisers experienced “adverse events”? (Hint: often!) Wondering just what the structured exercise program involved? (Hint: more than walking!) Let’s dig into the details!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Drugs such as low-dose aspirin (pictured) would be more effective if timed with the body’s natural rhythms, new research says. Many popular pills – including some cholesterol-busting statins – would be better taken at night than in the morning, scientists believe. They say widely-used tablets such as low-dose aspirin would be more effective if timed with the body’s natural rhythms. Scientists showed that individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day. They found that nearly half of all mouse genes work harder at some points in the 24-hour cycle than others, with ‘rush hours’ of activity just before dawn and dusk. Although the study was on mice, most mouse genes have ‘twins’ in humans. Many common drugs home in on these genes and so should be most effective when the genes are most active. This is particularly important in the case of medicines such as aspirin, which are broken down quickly by the body. The University of Pennsylvania study found 56 of the 100 best-selling drugs in the US act on genes that ebb and flow over the day. Similarly, 119 of the 250 pills on the World Health Organisation’s list of essential medicines may work better at a certain time of the day, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. Pennsylvania University’s pharmacology professor John Hogenesch said more work is needed to say when is the best time to take each pill. However, research already shows that low-dose aspirin, taken daily by millions of Britons who have survived a heart attack or stroke to keep their blood thin, is best taken at night. This ensures the drug has time to work before morning – the peak time for heart attacks. Likewise, simvastatin, one of the most widely-used cholesterol-lowering statin pills, should also be taken at bedtime. This is because the drug works by blocking a key step in the production of cholesterol, and the gene behind this step is most active at night. Patients are already told to take simvastatin in the evening, however many still take it at the wrong time. Some will take the drug in the morning to prevent them forgetting. Individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day. Many common drugs home in on these genes – and so should be most effective if given when the genes are most active, say U.S. researchers. Professor Hogenesch said: ‘There’s a huge opportunity for improving the action of existing drugs through better timing.’ Heidi Wright, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ‘Simvastatin…is best taken at bedtime as your liver makes most of your cholesterol at night. ‘Low-dose aspirin works by making your blood less sticky. There is research that says more heart attacks occur in the morning, so…reducing this stickiness by the morning could help prevent heart attacks.’ Women are putting their lives at risk by ignoring the symptoms of heart disease, researchers warn. Many brush pain off as indigestion or a pulled muscle and wait days or weeks before seeing a doctor. But in fact it could be a symptom of angina, where one of the arteries to the heart gets blocked, or a mild heart attack. Harvard researchers urge women not to assume heart attacks are a ‘man’s disease’ and to seek help. Statistically, women are less likely to have a heart attack than men before the menopause, but afterwards they overtake them and are more at risk. Furthermore, heart attacks in women tend to be more severe than in men – possibly because they have ignored the warning signs. Lead author Dr Catherine Kreatsoulas, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said: ‘Both men and women go into a phase of denial – but women seem to stay in this stage longer.’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article tells us that some medicines, like low-dose aspirin and cholesterol-lowering statins, work better if we take them at the right time of day.

A series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas. The diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \\"population sets\\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S. Even if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial. It is the first evidence of a plan for the \\"extreme vetting\\" of foreigners entering the United States that President Donald Trump promised during his campaign. The four cables sent between March 10 and March 17 do not define which groups would be considered among the \\"population sets\\" requiring more scrutiny.

There were also calls to extend the boycott to include French luxury goods and cosmetic products. Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. Some burned French flags, some added Swastika (due to its conotaions with Nazism) to the French flag, and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of French consulates and embassy. Some shoppers who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming were blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles. Hundreds of people joined Anti-French rallies in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao, which quickly spread to other cities like Xi'an, Harbin and Jinan. Carrefour denied any support or involvement in the Tibetan issue, and had its staff in its Chinese stores wear uniforms emblazoned with the Chinese national flag and caps with Olympic insignia and as well as the words \\"Beijing 2008\\" to show its support for the games.

Use the following casting schedule on your kiln to fuse the glass: Turn the temperature to 250 °F (121 °C) for 10 minutes. Raise the temperature to around 1,465 °F (796 °C) and leave it on that temperature for 10 minutes. Turn the heat down to 950 °F (510 °C) and leave the kiln at that temperature for 1 hour. Decrease the temperature to 850 °F (454 °C) and wait for 15 minutes. Turn the heat to 100 °F (38 °C). Leave the kiln closed and wait a day before you open it. Don't touch the mold or reach into the kiln until the outside is cool to the touch. The time it takes the kiln to cool will vary. Measure the temperature of the kiln an hour after it fired. This difference between the temperature it fired at and the temperature an hour later is the cooling rate per hour for the kiln. For example, if your kiln fired at 1,500 °F (820 °C) and an hour later the temperature is 1,250 °F (677 °C), the cooling rate is 250 °F (121 °C) per hour. Put gloves on when removing the glass from the kiln as it still might be quite warm. Place the glass on a steady work surface. Use a diamond pad or a grinding stone to make it smooth and get rid of any blemishes. Rub uneven or imperfect areas of the glass with the diamond pad or grinding stone to smooth out the imperfections. Hold the mold gently as you rub it with the diamond pad or grinding stone. Kilns are programmed to turn off after they're finished firing. If you want to, you can force the kiln to turn off by using the on/off switch on the kiln.

However, it can be understood in spoken informal English. To analyze this, let's break down the sentence structure and suggest an improved version of the sentence. The sentence contains two clauses: 1. \\"This girl will not buy bread.\\" 2. \\"Will she buy bread?\\" The first clause is a negative statement, indicating that the girl in question will not purchase bread. The second clause seems to contradict the first clause by questioning whether she will buy bread or not. In proper English, we can rephrase this sentence as a tag question to create a grammatically correct sentence. A tag question is a question added at the end of a statement to confirm or check information. Here's an improved version using tag questions: \\"This girl will not buy bread, will she?\\" This sentence follows the basic structure of a negative statement followed by a tag question. The tag question \\"will she?\\" is used to confirm or check the information provided in the statement, making the sentence more concise and clear. Alternatively, if the intention is to ask the question first and then provide the answer, you can rephrase the sentence as follows: \\"Will this girl buy bread? No, she will not.\\" In summary, the given test sentence, while it can be understood in informal spoken English, is not an appropriately structured grammatical English sentence.

Read this article and answer this question King John in June 1215 was forced to put his seal to \\"The Articles of the Barons\\" by a group of powerful barons who could no longer stand John's failed leadership and despotic rule. The king's Great Seal was attached to it on 15 June 1215. In return, the barons renewed their oaths of fealty to King John on 19 July 1215. A formal document to record the agreement was created by the royal chancery on 15 July: this was the original Magna Carta. \\"The law of the land\\" is one of the great watchwords of Magna Carta, standing in opposition to the king's mere will. The Magna Carta of 1215 contained clauses which in theory noticeably reduced the power of the king, such as clause 61, the \\"security clause\\". This clause allowed a group of 25 barons to override the king at any time by way of force, a medieval legal process called distraint that was normal in feudal relationships but had never been applied to a king. After a few months of half-hearted attempts to negotiate in the summer of 1215, open warfare broke out between the rebel barons and the king and his supporters. What was the process by which the king's power could be overridden?","completion":"The process by which the king's power could be overridden in the 1215 Magna Carta was through a medieval legal process called \\"distraint.\\" This process was outlined in Clause 61, known as the \\"security clause.\\" According to this clause, a group of 25 barons had the authority to override the king's decisions at any time by using force if necessary. Distraint was a common practice in feudal relationships, which allowed a lord to seize the property of a vassal in order to secure the performance of their feudal obligations or as a form of punishment for failing to fulfill these obligations. However, this practice had never before been applied to a monarch. In the case of King John and the Magna Carta, the barons sought to introduce this mechanism to limit the king's despotic rule and address concerns about his leadership. By including the security clause in the Magna Carta, the barons aimed to create a system of checks and balances on royal authority to protect their rights and ensure that the king adhered to the law of the land, rather than governing based on his mere will. Despite the barons renewing their oaths of fealty to King John after the Magna Carta was sealed, open warfare soon erupted between the rebel barons and the king's supporters. This highlights the fragility of the agreement and the broader, ongoing struggle for power between the monarchy and the barons during this era. Nonetheless, the concept of limiting a monarch's power through a form of legal restraint was a significant development that shaped the evolution of constitutional law in England and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years did it take for the conquest of Tenerife?","completion":"Title: The Historical Conquest of Tenerife: A Testimony of Persistence and Resilience Introduction Tenerife is the largest and most populous of the seven Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa. Known for its picturesque landscapes, lush vegetation, and unique wildlife, Tenerife has often been marked as a strategic point for political, commercial, and military ventures. Its historical significance, however, goes beyond its natural beauty and geographical advantage. The island played a central role during the period of European exploration and conquest in the 15th century. This article seeks to explore the journey of the conquest of Tenerife – a goal that took several years to accomplish. The Guanches: The Aboriginal Inhabitants of Tenerife Before exploring the conquest of Tenerife, it is essential to understand the culture and society of the native population. The island was inhabited by the Guanches, aboriginal people of Berber origin, who existed in relative isolation until European sailors began to venture into the Canary Islands in the 14th century. The Guanches lived in small communities, held unique religious beliefs, and maintained their distinctive art, language, and customs. Upon the arrival of the first Europeans, the native inhabitants initially resisted their attempts at conquest, establishing a lasting conflict between the two groups. The Beginning: Political Turmoil and Failed Expeditions The conquest of Tenerife did not commence as a single, well-coordinated effort. The initial steps towards claiming the island were marked by a series of failed expeditions and political disputes. In 1402, French explorer Jean de Béthencourt set out to conquer the Canary Islands under the backing of French and Castilian nobles, initiating the colonization process of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, and El Hierro. However, Tenerife evaded Béthencourt's grasp due to the fierce resistance of the native Guanches and the political dysfunction among the European powers. In the 15th century, amid constant tension between the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal, both nations set their sights on Tenerife and its strategic importance. However, this competition led to indecision, delays, and disorganization – factors that only prolonged the process of conquest. An infamous example was a failed 1464 expedition led by Castilian nobleman Diego García de Herrera, who was ultimately defeated by the Guanche forces. The Final Push: Conquering Tenerife The conquest of Tenerife, in its ultimate form, was driven by Spain's Crown of Castile, as it sought to consolidate its claim on the entire Canary Archipelago. In the late 15th century, Alonso Fernández de Lugo – a Spanish conquistador – was entrusted with the task. A seasoned military leader with prior experience in capturing the islands of La Palma and Gran Canaria, de Lugo was the perfect candidate for this arduous mission. In 1494, Alonso Fernández de Lugo embarked on a large-scale military expedition to conquer Tenerife. He assembled an army composed of Spanish soldiers, mercenaries, and allies from the previously conquered Canary Islands. The conquistador swiftly established a foothold on Tenerife, building the fortress of La Madera near present-day Santa Cruz. However, the conquest of Tenerife was not an easy task. The native Guanches, led by chiefs such as Tinerfe, Bencomo, and Acaimo, put up a fierce resistance that lasted for several months. The struggle culminated in the Battle of Aguere and the Battle of La Victoria in November 1494, where the Spanish forces finally managed to overcome the Guanche resistance. It was not until a few months later, on 25 July 1496, that the surrender of the remaining Guanche warriors was secured, effectively bringing about the end of the conquest of Tenerife. In Conclusion: The Lengthy Conquest of Tenerife The Spanish conquest of Tenerife spanned years of intermittent contact, failed expeditions, and political confrontation. The final push led by Alonso Fernández de Lugo lasted approximately two years, from the commencement of his expedition in 1494 to the surrender of the Guanche warriors in 1496. The conquest marked a turning point in the history of the Canary Islands as European colonization took root, and the indigenous Guanche culture slowly faded under the yoke of their conquerors. Despite the lasting impacts of these historical events, it is essential to remember the resilience and spirit of the native population, who fiercely resisted intrusion into their ancient and richly textured civilization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to get over a long relationship that ended Allow yourself to feel bad. Emotion-focused coping is important to dealing with a breakup. This means allowing yourself to feel grief, sadness, and anger.","completion":"Acknowledge the pain and accept that it's a part of the healing process. Taking the time to go through the emotions will help you come to terms with the reality of the situation and gradually grow stronger. Remember that it's okay to be vulnerable, as this is how we grow emotionally and build mental resilience after undergoing heartaches. Another crucial step in getting over a long relationship is self-care. Pay attention to your physical, emotional, and mental well-being by indulging in activities that nurture your soul and help you regain your balance. This can include regular exercise, healthy eating habits, and engaging in creative outlets, such as writing, painting, or dancing. Additionally, consider seeking professional help if you're struggling to cope with the aftermath of the breakup or need guidance on rebuilding your life and regaining your self-esteem. Reconnecting with close friends and family is also vital during this time, as they can provide support, comfort, and a listening ear. Surround yourself with positive individuals who care about your well-being and can provide objective advice or a different perspective if needed. Take this time to strengthen bonds with your loved ones, plan outings, and develop a new support network. Evaluate and reflect on the relationship and the lessons learned to gain a better understanding of what you want in a partner moving forward. This introspection is vital in identifying patterns that may have contributed to the breakup or understanding what changes in your life might be necessary to ensure success in future relationships. Be honest with yourself, and remember that it takes two to make or break a relationship. It is also important to establish boundaries and give yourself space from your ex-partner. Cut all ties if possible, including social media connections, shared friends, or frequent haunts. Keeping a distance will make it easier to detach oneself emotionally and enable progress towards moving on. Lastly, don't rush into another relationship to fill the void left by your previous one. Give yourself ample time to heal, grow, and rediscover who you are as an individual before committing to someone new. When you feel ready and emotionally stable, allow yourself to explore new social settings, expand your network, and gradually open your heart to new potential partners. Patience is key during this time; remember that getting over a long relationship takes time and often requires a great deal of effort, but the result is a stronger, healthier, and more resilient version of yourself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","completion":"c). No The hypothesis \\"SCR retrofits can be accomplished without the need for resources\\" is false based on the premise \\"Estimated Resources Needed for Single and Multiple SCR Retrofits.\\" An SCR retrofit, or selective catalytic reduction retrofit, refers to the modification or upgrading of an industrial facility, specifically its emission control system, to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) in its emissions using selective catalytic reduction technology. Implementing an SCR retrofit typically involves several steps, such as designing and engineering the system, procuring necessary equipment and materials, coordinating with contractors, performing necessary construction work, and testing and commissioning the system. These processes inevitably require various resources, including financial, material, and human resources, to ensure successful implementation. 1. Financial resources: The cost of implementing an SCR retrofit can vary significantly depending on factors such as the size and complexity of the system being retrofitted, the specific NOx reduction requirements, and the chosen SCR technology. Generally, expenses will be incurred for purchasing and installing the catalyst, system design and engineering, project management, and ongoing operation and maintenance. 2. Material resources: Various materials and equipment are needed for SCR retrofits, including catalyst materials (typically a combination of titanium dioxide, vanadium, and tungsten), ammonia storage and distribution systems, NOx analyzers, and flue modifications. Additional components, such as valves, piping, instrumentation, and control systems, may also be required depending on the specifics of the project. 3. Human resources: Competent and experienced professionals are necessary to ensure the successful implementation, operation, and maintenance of an SCR retrofit. These may include engineers, chemists, technicians, project managers, and construction personnel, depending on the scope and complexity of the project. 4. Time: SCR retrofits typically require a significant time investment for planning, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning. The time it takes to complete an SCR retrofit may be influenced by factors such as the size and complexity of the project, regulatory requirements, and site-specific constraints. In conclusion, it is not possible to accomplish SCR retrofits without the need for resources. These retrofit projects invariably require financial, material, and human resources, as well as time to be successfully implemented. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"SCR retrofits can be accomplished without the need for resources\\" is false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton in 1920? from the following article ? I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot. He also made several early broadcasts with Mangeot's quartet. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person that took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton in 1920, is Giovanni Battista Barbirolli, also referred to as John Barbirolli in the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Also, I don't think subtitles would have helped me to understand this piece of drivel-lame lame lame. The answer is:","completion":"The customer was clearly dissatisfied with the product. There are numerous indications throughout their review that point to their dissatisfaction, and this can be analyzed in greater detail and in several ways. 1. Usage of negative words and phrases: The customer used numerous negative terms such as \\"Absolutely Terrible,\\" \\"A Colossal BOMB,\\" \\"waste of my time,\\" \\"It stunk,\\" \\"lame and predictable,\\" \\"not one character worth caring about,\\" \\"exercise in self-massaging of Altman's ego,\\" \\"think twice,\\" and \\"drivel-lame lame lame.\\" All of these words and phrases contribute to an overall tone of dissatisfaction and disappointment in the product. 2. Comparison to a more likable element: The reviewer highlights that \\"the most likable actor was the dog,\\" which is likely meant to be a sarcastic and highly critical comment. The fact that an animal, which typically does not have a significant role in films, is mentioned as the most likable actor underscores the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the rest of the cast and the film overall. 3. Criticism of the creator: The customer accuses the film's director, Altman, of self-massaging and hubris. This indicates that the customer does not appreciate the creative direction the filmmaker took, which supports the notion of dissatisfaction with the end product. 4. Call for reconsideration: When the customer states that the director should \\"think twice before sending one of his 'ideas' to the screen,\\" it strongly implies that they believe this particular film shouldn't have been made or released. This clearly demonstrates their dissatisfaction with the product. 5. Reference to lacking clarity: The customer mentions that even subtitles would not have helped them understand the film, pointing to a lack of clarity and coherence in the plot and overall content. It seems the reviewer not only feels disappointed but also confused and misled, which further solidifies their dissatisfaction. In conclusion, based on the language and points covered in the review, we can confidently say that the customer was thoroughly dissatisfied with the product.

But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

Summarize the following: There are loads of different varieties, intensities, and styles of roller coasters, and deciding what kind of experience you want out of riding a roller coaster is an important first step. Some riders prefer old-school wooden coasters for a vintage feel, while others will prefer newer, super-fast, upside-down behemoths to test their mettle. The choice is completely up to you, but it's good to get some sense of what to expect from different kinds of coasters. Wooden roller coasters are the oldest and most classic types of coasters, and usually the kind you'll want to start on. They're operated with a traditional chain-lift mechanism, in which the cars are lifted to a peak and dropped to allow gravity to force the cars through the rest of the turns and valleys at high speed. It's also a fun and bumpy ride. These usually won't go upside down. The Texas Giant, the American Eagle at Six Flags America, and the Beast at King's Island are all examples of classic wooden coasters. Also, Thunderbolt is a common name for wooden coasters. Steel roller coasters feature complex steel tracks, offering somewhat smoother rides and more maneuverability, as well as the ability to invert the riders, incorporating loops, corkscrews, and all kinds of other exciting motions. Most modern roller coasters, including the classic Kingda Ka, the Millennium Force, Steel Dragon 2000 and the Storm Coaster are steel coasters. Not all roller coasters are designed the same way, and some are a bit more comfortable for first-time riders than others. Knowing a bit about the different types will help you pick the right one. For the beginner, traditional seated car roller coasters are typically the best way to get an introduction to the ride. They're comfortable, safe, and relatively simple. Floorless coasters, for example, allow the riders' legs to hang free, simulating an intense falling experience, while standing coasters lock the riders in place in an upright position. Wing coasters feature two cars that extend on either side of the track, giving your individual car the impression of floating, while suspended coasters are able to swing back and forth freely as the coaster goes around bends. If you're inexperienced at riding roller coasters, the best way to get your sea legs is to ride a smaller version of a coaster. Most parks have a variety of different types of roller coasters, and they're all fun. Smaller coasters will usually have less-intense drops, no loops, and will still give you a good thrill, going at high speeds. Often, they'll have shorter lines, too, which gives you less time to get nervous while you wait. Alternatively, depending on your temperament, it might be better to jump in the deep end and ride an intense roller coaster to get it over with. That way, you'll know you've been through the wildest of the wild and you don't need to be scared anymore. At the beginning of most roller coasters should be a measuring stick with a minimum height requirement for all riders. This isn't to punish enthusiastic kids who want to ride the big rides, but to ensure the safety of all the riders. The seats and safety harnesses need to be big enough to fit everyone, so kids and especially short people run the risk of slipping through the harness. Don't sneak past the height requirement and then wait in line. Typically, before you jump in the car, the park employees will measure you with a height stick and send off anyone who doesn't meet the mark. It would be too bad to have waited around for two hours just to get rejected at the last second. Most roller coasters feature warnings that pregnant rides, riders with heart conditions, and other physical ailments should not ride certain roller coasters. Most of these warnings will be featured at the beginning of the line, next to the height requirement. Don't ride if you have any concerns about your physical health. One great way to pick a roller coaster is to pick one that doesn't have an insanely long line. Very popular roller coasters will often have waits for up to two or three hours, depending on the ride and the park, so it's important to manage your time if you want to ride some roller coasters. It might be worth it to wait several hours for one big one, or you might rather spend your time riding other rides. Bring something to do in line, or some friends to talk with. Waiting that long can be awfully boring, and might be a lot more fun with a book or some buddies to goof off with. Be respectful and polite to everyone else in line who's waiting with you. Some theme parks also have fast passes, which allow you to show up to a ride at a designated time, skip the line, and hop right on the ride. This allows you to more efficiently use your time at the park, though these passes are more expensive than a regular ticket. On lots of roller coasters, the line will split once you get toward the end of it, to line up for different seats along the car. Once in the loading zone, pick the row you wish to ride in, and get in that line. Any of the cars are great choices for your first rides. Some people love the front for the view, while others love the back for what is called the \\"goat effect,\\" a phenomenon named after the Thunder Mountain roller coaster at Disneyland. Toward the back of the cars, the g-forces exerted on the riders are stronger, making the experience more intense, making up for the lack of view. If you don't have much of an opinion or preference, head to the shortest line to get on the ride the quickest. Less waiting, less nerves, more fun.","completion":"The passage discusses the various aspects of roller coasters. It first delineates the differences between wooden roller coasters, which offer a vintage, bumpy ride that rarely includes upside-down sections, and steel roller coasters that can have complex tracks with loops and other disorienting features, enabling much more intense experiences. Popular examples of each type are provided. The text further elaborates on the different seating experiences available, from traditional seated cars for beginners, to floorless coasters, standing coasters, and wing coasters that change the riders' orientation relative to the track for increased thrill. It is suggested that novice riders start with smaller, less intense roller coasters to familiarize themselves before moving onto larger ones. The passage also highlights the importance of the minimum height requirement for safety reasons and cautions against ignoring it. Additionally, rides may not be suitable for people with certain health conditions, and long queues are common for popular roller coasters. Strategies for choosing a ride based on waiting times, position in the car, and possible use of fast passes to minimize wait times are also discussed."},{"prompt":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Polish.

According to the provided information, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar is in fact the nephew of Sir C. V. Raman, not his son. The Chandrasekhar family has been prominent in the field of science, particularly physics. This intellectual Indian family has contributed significantly to various scientific developments and discoveries. In particular, Sir C. V. Raman and his nephew, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, have gained widespread recognition as Nobel laureates in physics. Sir C. V. Raman was born in 1888 in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, and became famous for his groundbreaking research in the field of light scattering. His discovery, referred to as the Raman Effect, earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics. Raman's scientific contributions include findings in the fields of acoustics, optics, molecular physics, and crystallography. On the other hand, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, born in 1910 in Lahore (now in Pakistan), gained distinction for his work on the theoretical underpinnings of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes –- celestial bodies that can form when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo gravitational collapse. This led to the formulation of the Chandrasekhar Limit, which defines the maximum mass a white dwarf can attain before collapsing into a denser state or exploding. For his contributions to the understanding of stellar evolution, Chandrasekhar was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics. In summary, although both Sir C. V. Raman and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar are distinguished physicists and Nobel laureates from the Chandrasekhar family, the relationship between them is that of uncle and nephew. It is incorrect to claim that Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar was the son of C. V. Raman based on the given paragraph."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

OPTIONS: 1). that it will improve the market value 2). that it will have no impact 3). the author has not given thought to market value 4). not enough information I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market.

This phrase typically indicates that something or someone has a charming and endearing quality that makes it easy for people to develop affection, appreciation, love, or attachment towards it or them, despite any potential initial resistance or preconceived notions. The use of the word \\"worm\\" in the phrase might initially suggest negative connotations, as worms are often associated with invasiveness and discomfort. However, within the context of the sentence, it is used metaphorically to emphasize the idea of effortlessly penetrating a person's emotions, winning over their affections in a genuinely heartwarming and endearing manner. Furthermore, the idea of something or someone reaching one's heart suggests a profound emotional impact. The heart is often regarded as the center of emotional experiences, so when something has the ability to reach a person's heart with ease, it implies an overwhelmingly positive feeling. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence is undoubtedly positive, as it conveys the notion of a subject's ability to evoke emotional attachment and an affectionate response, making it easier for people to become fond of or enamored with it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards.

This is a significant development in the ongoing narrative of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The decision to voice their request publicly shows an increased readiness by the North Korean government to engage in dialogue to address various issues affecting the two nations. Direct dialogues have been sporadic over the years, due to growing tensions and differences in policy, particularly surrounding nuclear programs and human rights. However, these talks signify a potential opportunity for both nations to express their concerns openly, reaching a common ground on key matters. The United States government has not yet provided a clear response to North Korea's demand, although the subject is currently under active consideration. Analysts believe that agreeing to direct talks could result in expanding communication channels and substantially ease tensions between the two countries. Despite the cautious optimism surrounding this latest development, it is crucial to remember the historical context of relations between the US and North Korea. Previous attempts at establishing direct discussions have faltered or ended without producing lasting results. Any future talks will need to be approached with patience and a sincere commitment to diplomacy, weighing both the possible benefits and potential risks. Nonetheless, North Korea's request for direct talks marks a possible turning point in their relationship with the United States. If executed thoughtfully, these dialogues could create a foundation for a more stable future, building trust and fostering cooperation on shared interests.

Be careful not to get the wax or grease onto the surrounding fabric. If you have a zipper pull that simply will not stay up, then attaching a keyring or safety pin to the zipper pull can help to keep it in place. If you use a keyring, then you can loop the keyring around the jeans button when the zipper is up. If you use a safety pin, then you can insert the pin through the fabric near your zipper when the pull is up. Another option is to spray some hairspray onto your zipper to prevent it from sliding down as easily. Spray hairspray along the length of the closed zipper teeth. This should make them tacky enough that the zipper will not keep sliding down. that is beyond repair. If the zipper is so broken that you cannot fix it, then you will likely need to replace it.

Sentence 1: Drill a hole into the wall. Sentence 2: Don't drill here, there's a gas pipe. Does drill mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"Yes, the word \\"drill\\" means the same thing in these two sentences. In both contexts, \\"drill\\" refers to the action of making a hole in a surface using a drill, which is a power tool with a rotating cutting end designed specifically for creating holes. However, the two sentences convey different messages related to the act of drilling. In Sentence 1 – \\"Drill a hole into the wall\\" – the speaker is instructing someone to go ahead and use a drill in order to create a hole in the wall. This could be for various purposes, such as hanging a picture frame, mounting a TV, or installing a shelf. This sentence is essentially an affirmation and permission for the drilling action to take place on the wall. On the other hand, Sentence 2 – \\"Don't drill here, there's a gas pipe\\" – serves as a warning about a potential hazard associated with drilling at a particular location. The speaker cautions the listener not to drill in the identified area because there is a gas pipe behind the wall, and drilling into it could possibly cause a gas leak, which is dangerous and could lead to catastrophic consequences. In this context, the speaker is advising against drilling in order to avoid any accidents or damage. Thus, while the word \\"drill\\" denotes the same action in both sentences, the context and purpose of drilling differ. The first sentence is an instruction to perform the act of drilling, and the second is a warning to abstain from drilling at a specific location due to safety concerns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Context: Recent studies have indicated a protective role of physiological autophagy in ischemic heart disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of autophagy regulation after ischemia are poorly understood. Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles released from cells that play critical roles in mediating cell-to-cell communication through the transfer of microRNAs. In this study, we observed that miR-30a was highly enriched in exosomes from the serum of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients in vivo and culture medium of cardiomyocytes after hypoxic stimulation in vitro. We also found that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α regulates miR-30a, which efficiently transferred via exosomes between cardiomyocytes after hypoxia. Inhibition of miR-30a or release of exosomes increased the expression of the core autophagy regulators beclin-1, Atg12, and LC3II/LC3I, which contributed to maintaining the autophagic response in cardiomyocytes after hypoxia. Taken together, the present study showed that exosomes from hypoxic cardiomyocytes regulate autophagy by transferring miR-30a in a paracrine manner, which revealed a new pathway of autophagy regulation that might comprise a promising strategy to treat ischemic heart disease. Answer: miR-30a is highly enriched in exosomes from the serum of AMI patients. Hypoxia induces miR-30a upregulation and enrichment into exosomes. MiR-30a is efficiently transferred via exosomes between hypoxic cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of exosome release contributes to maintaining of autophagy after hypoxia. Inhibition of miR-30a augments autophagy after hypoxia.","completion":"Question: How do exosomes from hypoxic cardiomyocytes regulate autophagy in relation to ischemic heart disease according to the study?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(Associated Press) Egyptian women wave flags during a rally in Cairo's Tahrir square, Egypt, Friday, Nov.18, 2011, in a protest against what they say are attempts by the country's military rulers to reinforce their powers.... (Associated Press) Most rallies in Tahrir have been led by liberal- or left-leaning groups. But Friday's rally was dominated by the country's most organized political group, the Muslim Brotherhood, which has rarely come out in full force since the protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak to step down in February. The Brotherhood had until recently avoided confrontation with the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, but now warns of escalating its protest campaign if plans to give permanent political powers to the military are not scrapped. \\"The army has no role in ruling people. Its only job is to protect the country. We want civilian rule chosen through democracy,\\" said Hani Hegazi, a 28-year old Brotherhood member who traveled by bus to Tahrir from the Delta province of el-Beheira. Banners read: \\"Down with military rule. Egypt our country is not a military camp.\\" Some demonstrators flew the Egyptian flag, while others including ultraconservative Salafis waved a banner declaring Islam's holy book, the Quran, to be \\"our constitution.\\" The rally was called to protest a document floated by the government which declares the military the guardian of \\"constitutional legitimacy,\\" suggesting the armed forces could have the final word on major policies even after a new president is elected. The document, which includes guiding principles for Egypt's new constitution, also introduces clauses that would shield it from civilian oversight. Most of Egypt's pro-democracy groups object to the document, calling it an attempt to perpetuate military rule past the post-Mubarak transitional period which is supposed to end with the election of a new parliament and a new president. In addition to the Brotherhood, Salafis, left- and liberal-leaning groups such as the April 6 movement and other youth revolutionary alliances joined the rally, demanding a timetable for the end of military rule, which began in February. They have called for marches from mosques around Egypt to major squares, dubbing it the \\"Friday of the Single Demand\\" _ that demand being a clear date for the transfer of power to civilian rule. Many groups have planned to hold an open ended sit-in until a date has been set. The Brotherhood says the document reinforces \\"dictatorship.\\" \\"It contains articles that rob the people of their sovereignty and reinforces dictatorship. It constitutes a coup against the principles and goals of the January 25 revolution,\\" the group said in a statement issued Wednesday. Last-minute negotiations between the government and the Brotherhood failed to stave off their participation in the rally, or scrap the document. The show of force comes 10 days before the country's first parliamentary elections since Mubarak stepped down, when a Brotherhood-affiliated political party is expected to fare well. Anger against the Supreme Council has been building up over their management of the transition period. Many complain that the generals are recreating the Mubarak regime by cracking down on opponents, by refusing to order a thorough reform of the security services, and by monopolizing decision making. Islamists and liberals alike now express fear that the military council wants to hold on to power, a claim denied by the generals. The military council had promised to transfer power to an elected civilian government within six months of Mubarak's ouster. But according to a vague timetable in place, it may not be until early 2013 that a president is elected. Only the dates for the parliamentary elections, which are due to begin in ten days and which will drag into March, are yet known. Walid Farouk, 32, who wore the heavy beard and traditional robe of the ultraconservative Salafi trend, said that Egypt had seen nothing good from military rule since the army first took power in 1952. \\"All of us are scared that the army could try to hold on to power,\\" he said. \\"It is time for a civilian government.\\" The writing of Egypt's constitution has been a divisive issue, and details of who will write it and what it contains are at the heart of recent rallies. Some liberals have supported the idea of writing guiding principles for the constitution, fearing that a parliament controlled by Islamists would insert religious principles into the document. Even now, some liberals remain opposed to the Friday rally, saying a document is necessary to detail how members of the assembly are to be chosen, and controversial clauses can be negotiated. But many others have come to distrust the military's Supreme Council at least as much they distrust the Islamists. At Friday's rally, protesters are also expected to celebrate the birthday of one of the most prominent revolutionary to be jailed by the military prosecutor. Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a famous blogger and activist, was detained late last months for refusing to answer to the military prosecution on his alleged role in sectarian violence that left 27, mostly Christians, dead. He turned 30 on Friday. Many hold the military responsible for the violence, and see Abdel-Fattah's detention as an attempt to find a scapegoat and discredit activists. ||||| CAIRO — Tens of thousands of Islamists jammed Tahrir Square on Friday, demanding the swift exit of Egypt ’s interim military rulers in the most significant challenge to their authority since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak nine months ago. The huge turnout was the first time that Egypt’s Islamists had so openly and aggressively challenged military rule, ending an uneasy truce that had prevailed as long as the military appeared willing to allow the Islamists as much of a say in Egypt’s future as they could win at the ballot box. That truce fell apart, on the eve of parliamentary elections, after the military council spelled out for the first time its intention to preserve a decisive role for itself in Egyptian politics far into the future, elevating itself above civilian control and imposing rules to protect individual and minority rights. And after sitting out many of the protests organized by liberals since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, Islamists took to the streets on Friday in a fierce backlash. “The people didn’t sacrifice hundreds of lives in the revolution so that the military would jump over their will,” said Mohamed Ibrahim, a teacher at a religious school who traveled from Mansoura, about 75 miles away, to attend. “If they can do that, what is the point of parliamentary elections?” The rally represented the beginning of a new battle between Egypt’s two most powerful political forces, the military and the once-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, that leaves Egyptian liberals and leftists anxious and divided on the sidelines. “Each side is drawing a line in the sand over its future role in the political process,” said Prof. Emad Shahin, an Egyptian scholar at Notre Dame who was in Tahrir Square on Friday. “The military forces would like to secure an exit from the transitional period with some kind of assurances of their future role in the political scene, and the Islamists think that this could put a check on their power even if they win in clean and fair elections.” After sunset, as thousands of protesters prepared to camp overnight in the square, the military-led government declared in a statement that it refused to withdraw its guidelines but that it would continue to debate them with political leaders through the beginning of the coming elections. The move ensured that the deeply polarizing debate would continue to grip the country as voters go to the polls, beginning Nov. 28. Many liberals were torn between their fears of military rule and a religious takeover. Most liberals stayed home despite the stated democratic demands of the protest: giving power to elected civilians. In fact, some liberals appeared to be looking to the military council to act as a hedge against a religious takeover and to impose a “bill of rights” before elections that the Islamists might win. “The liberals would rather prolong the transitional phase than accept the results of clean and fair elections, which shows they are not very sure about their weight in society and politics,” Professor Shahin said, suggesting they preferred “to cooperate with those in power.” The April 6 Movement, a pivotal force in the uprising, was one of the few liberal groups to make a conspicuous presence on Friday. Its banners called the day “the Friday of One Demand” — meaning a transfer of power to the lower house of Parliament as soon as it is seated in April. The military initially pledged to cede power to a civilian authority by September, but is now expected to delay that transition until 2013 or later. An April 6 activist said its members had been told not to talk about the military’s controversial guidelines. “Of course there are fears of Islamists’ taking power,” said Dina Allithy, 23, a recent college graduate and a member of the group. “But today we are trying to ignore all of that.” The Brotherhood, an organization that honed its discipline under decades of police scrutiny, sent hundreds of members on Thursday night to camp out and start setting up in Tahrir Square, the staging ground of a two-week sit-in that ousted Mr. Mubarak in February. By Friday morning, buses arrived carrying thousands of supporters from outside Cairo. ||||| Tens of thousands of Islamist and secular protesters gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square and Alexandria on Friday for a mass rally to pressure the ruling military council to hand over power to a civilian government. The demonstration, dubbed the \\"Friday of One Demand,\\" was called in response to a document of \\"supraconstitutional\\" principles floated by the government that declares the military the guardian of \\"constitutional legitimacy\\", suggesting the armed forces could have the final word on major policies even after a civilian parliament and president are elected. A wide spectrum of political groups including liberals and ultraconservative Islamists have decried the document even as they reportedly negotiate with the government to get it changed. Though opposition to the military's perceived power grab comes from all sides, Muslim religious movements are the most vocal. They fear that the document will push Egypt toward a more civil, secular state. Yasir Hamida, a 40-year-old member of the Muslim Brotherhood, told Al Jazeera's Malka Bilal that he had lived through the former regime and now wanted to \\"do something for our kids\\". \\"My demand is that the ... document be cancelled. Enough. We are tired now. We thank the army, but it's time to transfer power and let the parliament start organising a constitution and get ready for a civilian state,\\" he said. \\"I'm happy that all the coalitions are here today.\\" Elections for the lower house of parliament, the People's Assembly, begin on November 28 and will last until January, occurring in three stages. The upper house, or Shura Council, will be elected after that. The ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), which assumed ultimate executive power after President Hosni Mubarak stepped down in February, initially promised a presidential election in early 2012 but has recently suggested it could occur as late as 2013. In the meantime, the SCAF will be able to propose and veto legislation, convene and adjourn parliament, and appoint the prime minister and cabinet. Liberals join with Islamists Friday's protest drew political parties and religious movements of different stripes, though the loudest voices in the square came from Islamists, including hardline Salafis and the comparatively moderate Muslim Brotherhood. Liberal, leftist and Islamist parties and groups such as the April 6 Movement, founded in solidarity with labour protests, participated in the rally. Islamists joined with their call to put an end to military trials of civilians, which have led to the incarceration of thousands in proceedings described by human rights activists as opaque and unfair. Anan Zuhairi, a 26-year-old doctor, told Bilal she was not with any party or political movement but that she joined the protest because \\"nothing has been resolved since the revolution\\". \\"Nothing we revolted for has happened. Emergency law is still not canceled. People are being taken out of their homes. Our demands have remained the same except they've become more,\\" she said. \\"We just want democracy and freedom. The people with opinions are all in prisons.\\" The two main demands of the protesters were to prevent the imposition of the government's document and to set a date for the presidential elections, Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros said. \\"People are saying there has been no referendum on this document, and are asking why it is being imposed before the upcoming elections,\\" she said. \\"They see this as the military trying to impose their rule.\\" \\"They are telling the military to stop trying to unilaterally control this transition period,\\" she said. Document shields SCAF budget Though some parties had called for an extended sit-in, most of the crowd started to leave after the sun set and the weather began to turn cold, Tadros said, and the Muslim Brotherhood instructed its supporters to go home by 8pm. Al Jazeera's Jamal Elshayyal, in the northern coastal city of Alexandria, reported that thousands of people had also gathered there, \\"mainly heeding the call from the Salafists and the Muslim Brotherhood.\\" After prayers, the crowd marched from mosques to a major military headquarters to protest the SCAF's rule. Protesters chanted \\"we do not want military rule\\" and \\"we must protect our revolution\\". The contested government document, written by Deputy Prime Minister Ali Selmi, includes clauses that remove the military's budget from parliamentary oversight and allow the SCAF a final say on military-related matters. Selmi and the rest of the cabinet have been approved by the SCAF and ultimately answer to the military. The government has revised the draft, but Islamists, who organised a mass protest in July against such a charter, have rejected the very idea of a document that would limit parliament's authority to draft the constitution, branding the articles as undemocratic. The Muslim Brotherhood, through its Freedom and Justice Party, may emerge as the largest bloc in the election. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A big group of people in Egypt got together in a place called Tahrir Square to protest against the military rulers.

For this purpose, tweezers are the perfect tool. They provide the precision required to remove sprouts without damaging the surrounding ones. Once your seedlings have happily matured and stand tall at 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm), you need to upscale their living conditions. The seedlings then need to be transplanted into pots. Doing so allows for more adequate space for mature root development, further enabling the plants to draw nutrients more effectively and ensuring their healthy growth. An overriding factor for prosperous growth involves the right nutrition strategy. For tobacco, applying a fertilizer that contains nitrate but absolutely no chlorine is a prerequisite. Nitrate is paramount as it enhances the leaf quality and improves the overall yield. In contrast, tobacco plants are sensitive to chlorine, which can adversely influence the plant's growth and productivity. As for sunlight exposure, tobacco craves a reasonable amount of it. Keep your tobacco plants in an area that provides around 6 hours of sunlight each day. Such an exposure amount would ensure enough photosynthesis for the plants' growth, yet not too much to cause plant stress or water loss through transpiration. The watering process is a delicate balance for tobacco. You want the soil to be wet enough to provide ample moisture to the tobacco roots, but never so drenched that it leaves your plants wallowing in a water-logged state. Overwatering can cause roots to suffocate and encourage the proliferation of harmful fungi and pests. One final but significant piece of advice pertains to flower management. As the tobacco plant begins to bloom, avoid the temptation of leaving these flowers to form completely. Make a conscious effort to cut off these flowers as they begin sprouting. This step redirects the plant's energy from reproduction back into leaf development, thus ensuring bigger and healthier leaves - the prized components of the tobacco plant. In conclusion, cultivating tobacco is an art as much as it is a science: demanding strategic selectiveness in sprout choice, precise transplantation, quality fertilization, a careful balance of sunlight and water, and dutiful flower control. Tending to these factors with care can lead to a bountiful, healthy yield of tobacco leaves, and an ultimately rewarding gardening experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was often referred to as \\"America's oldest teenager\\" because of his youthful appearance, which is one of the reasons he could be considered as an \\"ageless\\" star. Dick Clark started his career in the radio and television industry in the late 1940s and early 1950s. However, it was his role as the host of the popular TV show \\"American Bandstand\\" (1956–1989) that catapulted him into stardom. \\"American Bandstand\\" was a music-performance and dance television program that showcased many famous musicians and bands over the years. Clark's charismatic personality and appealing looks made him an ideal host for the show and provided youth with guidance in popular music and dance trends. In 1972, the first edition of \\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\\" was launched and hosted by Dick Clark. The show was created as an alternative to Guy Lombardo's \\"New Year's Eve\\" broadcasts, which mainly featured a traditional big band music style. Dick Clark's \\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\\" brought forth a fresher format by showcasing contemporary popular music acts and celebrating the New Year with live performances and music. The program became a staple of American New Year's Eve celebrations and turned into an annual tradition that millions of viewers tuned into every year. Dick Clark continued to host the event for decades, with \\"New Year's Rockin' Eve\\" becoming a cultural phenomenon and a significant part of Clark's legacy. The show's structure generally involved a live broadcast from Times Square in New York City, witnessing the famous ball drop, interspersed with pre-recorded musical performances and interviews. Dick Clark was synonymous with the event and was admired for his incredible ability to relate to the audience and his remarkable energy for his age. However, in 2004, Clark suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed and affecting his speech. While he made efforts to continue hosting the show, it became evident that he needed support to carry on the tradition.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Movie title: The Warrior Movie plot: In 1375, a small political envoy travels to China to meet the Ming Emperor. Mistaken for spies, the envoy is arrested. Their prisoner transport is attacked by Mongol marauders, who kill the Chinese guards and allow the Koreans to live. All the Korean ambassadors have died, leaving the inexperienced general to take charge. The soldiers arm themselves and quickly discover that the Mongols have kidnapped the Ming Emperor's daughter. They ambush the Mongols and rescue the princess. Yeo-sol, the former slave of an ambassador, defeats the injured Mongolian general Rambulwha in single combat, but allows him to live and escape.The Koreans flee with the Princess, determined to return her safely to the Ming Emperor to atone for their diplomatic failure. The Mongols pursue, hoping to recover the Princess and marry her to the Yuan Emperor so that he may legitimize his claim over all China. Koreans head for a seaside fortress that the Princess tells them about, where they expect to find safe haven. Along the way, the Koreans pick up a group of Chinese peasants who are also fleeing from the Mongols.Fighting their way through Mongol search parties, the group experiences many internal conflicts stemming from social class, love, and honor. The lower-class soldiers chafe under their poor treatment in comparison to the soldiers of the upper-class. They have little confidence in their young general, and prefer taking orders from their veteran sergeant, Dae-Jung. The Princess has difficulty adjusting to the rough necessities of her position on the run. The General and Yeo-sol become nemeses, competing for the affections of the Princess and exchanging blows on several occasions.The group reaches the fortress, only to find it an abandoned ruin. As the group prepare to mount a last stand, the Princess attempts to give herself up to the Mongols. Yeo-sol and the General recover her, and Yeo-sol is captured. Rambulwha offers a place in his army for Yeo-sol, but as the Mongols mount an offensive, Yeo-sol returns to the Koreans. In the...","completion":"Answer: In the movie \\"The Warrior,\\" the small political envoy was arrested because they were mistaken for spies. As the movie is set in the year 1375, tensions and uncertainties between different nations and cultures were common. When the envoy from Korea arrived in China to meet the Ming Emperor, the Chinese authorities likely interpreted their presence as a potential threat, given the lack of reliable communication and trust between the nations. It is essential to note that during this time, several political factions and groups were vying for power and influence. The envoy's arrival might have caused suspicion among the Chinese authorities, leading to their arrest as a precautionary measure. In deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, it's essential to consider various factors such as the script's quality, the plot's uniqueness, the production team's experience and competence, the potential target audience, and the film's marketability. \\"The Warrior\\" has an intriguing and action-packed plot, which could hold the interest of audiences. Moreover, the movie covers themes such as political turmoil, interpersonal conflicts regarding social class, love, and honor, making it appealing to a wide range of viewers. The historical context adds an educational aspect to the film, making it not only an entertaining watch but also informative. If the film is well-executed, with strong acting performances, vivid visuals, and high-quality production values, it could be a worthwhile investment that yields positive returns and garners critical acclaim. However, as with any investment, there are risks involved. It's crucial to research and analyze the proposal thoroughly and gather as much information as possible about the production team, the projected budget, and potential sources of funding. You should also weigh the potential risks and rewards, seeking professional advice from industry experts, financial advisors, or legal counsel to make a sound investment decision.

I mean, it's quite unusual to see someone with the same name visiting the monsignor himself.\\" Lieutenant Verona chuckled a little at the man's nervous display, taking it all in stride. \\"Yes, I'm related to Monsignor Verona. He's my uncle, actually,\\" she replied with a warm smile, trying to put the young man at ease. \\"Please, lead the way.\\" The young man, who introduced himself as Marco, nodded vigorously and began leading Lieutenant Verona through the church's intricate hallways. The combination of the high vaulted ceilings and the delicate glow of the sunlight filtering through the stained glass windows gave the church an ethereal ambiance that was difficult to describe. As they proceeded further, the lieutenant couldn't help but notice the countless pieces of religious art adorning the walls and ceilings, each telling a different story from the Bible. Despite his initial shock, Marco's demeanor never changed. He incessantly chatted about the church's history, architectural design, and the various works of art that they passed by. It was clear that he was passionate about his job, often pausing to explain the significance of a particular sculpture or painting in great detail. Eventually, they arrived at the door of a modest office that stood at the end of a long corridor. Without knocking, Marco pushed the door open and gestured for the lieutenant to enter. \\"Monsignor Verona is waiting for you inside,\\" he whispered, almost reverently. As she stepped inside the office, Lieutenant Verona was greeted by her uncle, who was sitting behind his desk, engrossed in reading a thick book. He looked up as she entered, and a warm smile spread across his face as he recognized her. \\"Ah, Lieutenant! It has been too long,\\" Monsignor Verona exclaimed, rising from his desk to embrace his niece. They exchanged pleasantries and began to catch up, with the lieutenant recounting her latest adventures in her career, while Monsignor Verona shared the various challenges he faced overseeing the church and attending to the needs of his congregation. During their conversation, the lieutenant couldn't help but feel a sense of tranquility and contentment wash over her. Her uncle's office was a stark contrast to the opulence of the church – simple, yet comfortable. The scent of old books and the faint aroma of incense created a welcoming atmosphere that encouraged deep and thoughtful conversations. As the hours passed, the discussion between the lieutenant and her uncle shifted towards more personal matters. They spoke of family members, shared anecdotes about their childhood, and reflected on their shared hopes and dreams for the future. Throughout their conversation, it became clear that the bond between Lieutenant Verona and Monsignor Verona was not only familial but also spiritual. Their mutual love and respect transcended blood ties, and it was evident that the lieutenant found solace and wisdom in her uncle's guidance. As the daylight began to fade, it was time for Lieutenant Verona to take her leave. As they exchanged heartfelt goodbyes, she promised to visit her uncle more often and to continue their meaningful conversations. With the warmth of familial love in their hearts, they parted ways – Lieutenant Verona resuming her duties, and Monsignor Verona returning to his sacred duties at the church. --- This encounter between Lieutenant Verona and her uncle, Monsignor Verona showcases the beauty of familial bonds and the depth of connections that can be established when there is mutual love, respect, and understanding. The journey through the church, guided by the charming and knowledgeable Marco, serves as a metaphor for the continuity and guidance that family can provide to one another. And ultimately, it serves as a reminder that no matter how complex and demanding one's life may become, it is in the sanctuary of family and spirituality that we can often find solace, wisdom, and purpose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs.

At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you?

The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula.

The European Council, as the institution responsible for defining the European Union's political direction and priorities, plays a crucial role in fostering stronger political and economic ties between the EU and the US. The EU is the largest trade and investment partner of the US, and their cooperation covers multiple areas, including economy, trade, energy, security, and the environment. Some of the key initiatives pursued by the European Council to enhance EU-US relations are: 1. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP): This proposed trade agreement aimed to strengthen economic ties between the EU and the US, creating more growth and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Although negotiations took place between 2013 and 2016, they have been on hold due to differences on crucial issues like market access, regulatory cooperation, and public procurement. 2. EU-US Energy Council: Founded in 2009, this council seeks to promote transparent and competitive energy markets, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. They also collaborate on research and technology for secure and sustainable energy and discuss global energy security challenges. 3. The New Transatlantic Agenda: Launched in 1995, this agreement creates a framework for EU-US cooperation on promoting peace and stability, democracy, and development around the world. Initiatives in this agenda have included joint efforts against terrorism, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and facilitating conflict resolution. 4. The EU-US Privacy Shield Framework: This initiative, which has been recently invalidated by the European Court of Justice, aimed to provide companies on both sides with a mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States. 5. Dialogue on security and defense: To strengthen cooperation in addressing global security challenges, the EU and the US engage in a structured dialogue on security and defense. Areas of collaboration include tackling cyber threats, hybrid threats, and countering terrorism. 6. The EU-US Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) cooperation: This cooperation focuses on border management, migration, law enforcement, and civil protection. The dialogue between the EU and the US addresses common challenges such as cross-border crime, terrorism, and irregular migration. 7. Dialogue on climate change and the environment: EU and US representatives meet regularly to discuss policies and actions related to climate change, resource efficiency, and circular economy. They also coordinate on multilateral environmental agreements and initiatives. The European Council will continue to seek and develop initiatives that benefit both the EU and the US. This will require close and effective cooperation to address common challenges, seize opportunities, and work towards shared values and goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What work by a Roman emperor shows the influence of Stoicism on the Roman upper classes?\\" is in \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic.

It has several common names, including: aplodontia, mountain boomer, ground bear, and giant mole. The name sewellel beaver comes from \\"sewellel\\" or \\"suwellel\\", the Chinookan term for a cloak made from its pelts. This species is the only living member of its genus, Aplodontia, and family, Aplodontiidae. It should not be confused with true North American and Eurasian beavers, to which it is not closely related. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - The term Sciuromorpha has referred to numerous groups of rodents , but the only family common to all variations is the Sciuridae , the squirrels . Most definitions also include the mountain beaver . Traditionally , the term has been defined on the basis of the shape of the infraorbital canal . A sciuromorphous zygomasseteric system is characterized by attachment of the lateral masseter muscle along the side of the rostrum . Unlike hystricomorphous and myomorphous rodents , the medial masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital canal . Among extant rodents , only the families Sciuridae , Castoridae , Heteromyidae , and Geomyidae are truly sciuromorphous . Some authorities would exclude the Geomyidae and Heteromyidae from that list due to the attachment of the medial masseter directly behind the zygomatic arch. Carleton and Musser ( 2005 ) redefined rodent suborders on the basis of a host of both morphological and molecular reasons . They defined the Sciuromorpha as including three families , Sciuridae , Aplodontiidae , and Gliridae . Of these , only the Sciuridae are truly sciuromorphous . The Aplodontiidae are protrogomorphous and the Gliridae are myomorphous . The connection between Aplodontiidae and Sciuridae has been proposed numerous times in the past . The two families have been united into a common infraorder ( Sciurida ) or superfamily ( Sciuroidea ) . It has long been suggested that dormice ( Gliridae ) are not particularly related to the Myomorpha , and their zygomasseteric structure has been termed \`\` pseudomyomorphy '' . The connection between squirrels and dormice has been almost exclusively suggested through genetic studies , and to a lesser degree via the fossil rodent Reithroparamys . - The Eurasian beaver or European beaver (\\"Castor fiber\\") is a species of beaver which was once widespread in Eurasia. It was hunted to near-extinction for both its fur and castoreum; and by 1900, only 1200 beavers survived in eight relict populations in Europe and Asia. Reintroduced through much of its former range, it now occurs from Great Britain to China and Mongolia, although it is absent from Italy, Portugal, the southern Balkans, and the Middle East. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction.

Write the answer: Which Midlands city was formed when several towns joined together as a county borough in 1910, achieving city status in 1928?","completion":"The Midlands city that was formed when several towns joined together as a county borough in 1910, and later achieved city status in 1928, is Stoke-on-Trent. Stoke-on-Trent is located in Staffordshire, England, and is a unique city known for its rich industrial heritage, specifically in pottery and ceramics. The city was created through the amalgamation of six towns, namely Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-upon-Trent, and Tunstall. The decision to unify these towns was driven by the need to resolve a range of local government, public health, and economic issues present in the area at the time. The Federation of Stoke-on-Trent, as it was initially known, marked a significant change in the way local government operated within the region. Before the federation, the six towns were independent urban districts, each with its powers and functions. However, as these towns grew, their proximity led to an overlap of resources and services, making it necessary to centralize authority to better manage the area, provide efficient services to inhabitants, and foster economic development. Through the process of unification, the six original towns retained much of their unique identities, while at the same time, creating a shared identity through becoming part of the larger Stoke-on-Trent area. One of the major reasons that Stoke-on-Trent received its city status in 1928 was due to the importance of pottery manufacturing in the area. Known as the Potteries, Stoke-on-Trent had become the world center of ceramic production, with famous factories such as Wedgwood, Spode, and Royal Doulton operating within the city. Stoke-on-Trent's city status was granted during the celebration of the 679th anniversary of the signing of King John's Charter, which initially established the borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme. This significant achievement in Stoke-on-Trent's history was recognized by the King and led to it being given city status, a testament to the burgeoning success of the pottery industry. Today, Stoke-on-Trent continues to be known for its pottery and ceramics industry, although over time, the city has diversified its economy, incorporating fields such as information technology, healthcare, and higher education. This transformation has led to new opportunities for growth and development, while still retaining a strong connection to its industrial past. The city's history and culture continue to be celebrated through museums, galleries, and events, ensuring that Stoke-on-Trent's unique identity as a united county borough continues to thrive in the modern era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Baby Gammy and his mother have moved into a new house paid for using part of the 250,000 raised for his family through public donations. About half of the money raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, leaving 120,000 to cover 10-month-old Gammy's future medical and living expenses, said charity Hands Across The Water. Charity founder Peter Baines said the family needed a new home because their previous one-bedroom unit was too run-down for Gammy, who still suffers from a lung condition. Scroll down for video. Baby Gammy and his mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua moved into a new house, 100km south of Bangkok. Almost half of the 250,00 raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, where the pair will live with Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children. 'He was recently back in hospital for six days prior to them moving into house,' Mr Baines told Daily Mail Australia. 'We took advice from Down Syndrome Australia who said the environmental conditions of where the kids live are important. 'They're more susceptible to illness, colds, and virus than children who do not have Down syndrome so they need to live in a cleaner, healthier environment that's why we were keen to see them moved.' Earlier this year Goy and Gammy found themselves at the centre of an international row over the ethics and legality of surrogacy when it emerged Gammy's Australian parents David and Wendy Farnell abandoned him in Thailand but took home his healthy twin sister Pipah. Before moving into the new home Gammy was in hospital for six days due to a lung infection. Goy and Gammy pose with Nom Manochantr, general manager of Hands Across The Water in Thailand. Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Pipah, the West Australian reported. Pipah recently returned to Australia after a trip to China with Mrs Farnell for her mother's funeral. WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said officers have yet to make a decision about whether she can stay in the care of her father David Farnell, a convicted child sex offender. 'The department was fully aware of her travel and was supportive of her taking time to grieve and spend time with her family,' Ms Morton told the West Australian. 'While this specific case is still subject to an ongoing thorough assessment, I can assure you that much has happened behind the scenes.' The family needed a new home because their previous one-bedroom unit (pictured) was too run-down for Gammy, who still suffers from a lung condition. The family plans to do some alterations at the front of their new house to set up a noodle shop, similar to the one they used to run at Goy's grandparents nearby house (pictured) Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, pictured with David and Wendy Farnell. The house for Gammy's family was purchased and is being held under a trust in the name of Hands Across The Water, which is managing the family's money on behalf of his Thai surrogate mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua. 'This way we guarantee the safety of the house so the family can't sell it or use it for any means that are inappropriate,' Mr Baines said. Gammy, Goy, and Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children moved into the home earlier this month. Mr Baines said Gammy was now much healthier and has gained a lot of weight. He added that the family plans to do some alterations at the front of the house to set up a noodle shop, similar to the one at the front of Goy's grandparents' house where Gammy sometimes stayed. Hands Across The Water founder Peter Baines visited the family earlier this month to assess their situation and needs. Pictured: Goy and her three children. Mr Baines described Gammy as: 'a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life' 'That's not out of necessity, because we're paying them more than enough in a monthly allowance,' he said. 'It's just a way for Goy to be productive and earn an income.' The house is in the same neighbourhood as the family's previous residence, in an industrial area about 100km south of Bangkok, where they also ran a small shop selling salads and noodles. Mr Baines said 250,000 was raised for Gammy through the Go Fund Me website, but the company took 10,000 in fees. 'We made approaches and asked if they could discount that and they said no,' he said. Three people, who wish to remain anonymous, originally set up the Go Fund Me page to raise 25,000 for Gammy. Media outlets picked up the details of that fund when the story started gaining worldwide media attention, and when the amount of money donated became too much for them to handle they asked Hands Across The Water took step in and manage it. Mr Baines said: 'we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood' Earlier in the year, Hands Across The Water administered 20,000 towards Gammy's medical costs, including moving him from a public to a private hospital, when he was suffering from a lung infection.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question deals with the difference between various fan sockets (CPU FAN, CPU OPT, and SYS FAN) on a motherboard, while the second question is about the compatibility of an LGA 1150 CPU cooler on an LGA 1151 CPU socket. Let's address both questions separately. 1. Difference between CPU FAN, CPU OPT, and SYS FAN sockets on a motherboard: CPU FAN socket: This is the primary socket on the motherboard that is dedicated to the fan of the CPU cooler. It provides necessary power and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control to manage the speed of the CPU cooler's fan optimally. Connecting the CPU cooler's fan to this socket enables the system to monitor and adjust the fan speed according to the CPU temperature for efficient cooling. CPU OPT socket: CPU Optional (OPT) socket, also sometimes referred to as CPU FAN2, is an additional socket usually provided for a second or supplementary fan of high-end CPU coolers or for a water cooling pump in water-cooled systems. The CPU OPT socket allows the system to control the secondary fan or pump in sync with the primary CPU fan to ensure efficient cooling. Although it's not necessary to use this socket if the cooling system does not require an additional fan or pump. SYS FAN socket(s): System Fan (SYS FAN) sockets, which are usually available in multiple numbers on a motherboard, are designed to connect case fans that help in maintaining airflow throughout the PC enclosure. These sockets enable the motherboard to monitor and control the speed of the case fans according to the system temperature. The case fans are crucial to keeping other components, like GPU or storage drives, at optimal temperatures. 2. Can an LGA 1150 CPU cooler fit on an LGA 1151 CPU socket? LGA 1150 (also known as Socket H3) and LGA 1151 (also known as Socket H4) are two different CPU sockets designed by Intel for their processors. Although they differ in terms of supported processors and chipsets, they share the same cooler mounting holes. As a result, an LGA 1150 CPU cooler should fit on an LGA 1151 CPU socket without any issues. However, it's always recommended to check the CPU cooler manufacturer's compatibility list to ensure the cooler would efficiently cool the particular processor used in the system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- As this election season unfolds, we are watching an age-old dream in politics go horribly smash. It isn't good for politics, and it sure isn't good for the country. President Franklin Roosevelt helped to fire up the dream during his second term in office. Coming off a massive landslide in 1936, he believed that it would be far better for governing if the Democrats became the liberal party and Republicans the conservative one. In the 1938 congressional elections, he barnstormed across the South trying to purge the Democratic Party of several incumbent conservatives. His efforts backfired -- the incumbents won and were sore at FDR -- but the dream became a staple of politics. Meanwhile, Barack Obama has moved left, pushing taxes on the rich, piling up trillion-dollar deficits and bashing the same","completion":"business interests that once supported him. On the other side of the aisle, Republicans have moved further right, embracing tax cuts for the wealthy, advocating for deregulation, and opposing nearly every policy proposed by the Democrats. This increasing polarization has led to a political environment where compromise seems almost impossible, and both parties are focused on appealing to their respective bases rather than collaborating for the common good. This growing divide has made governing more challenging, leading to gridlock and public frustration. Key issues such as healthcare, climate change, and income inequality remain unaddressed. As a result, the nationwide problems that demand bipartisan solutions continue to worsen, affecting the lives of millions of Americans. It's essential for politicians to step back and reassess the consequences of their entrenched positions. They must actively work towards bridging the partisan gap and collaborating on policies that serve the public's best interests. In order to achieve this, elected officials must be willing to prioritize compromise over party loyalty, focusing on the collective good rather than political division. In conclusion, as the political divide in America deepens, lawmakers should break free from the constraints of their partisan positions and facilitate collaboration and compromise. By doing so, they can effectively address the pressing challenges facing the country and restore faith in the political system. Failure to do so will only deepen the divide, hinder progress, and continue to undermine the health of the nation."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The Obama administration pulled its ambassador out of Syria over security concerns, blaming President Bashar Assad's regime for the threats that made it no longer safe for him to remain. FILE - In this June 20, 2011 photo taken during a government-organized tour for foreign diplomats and the media, US ambassador in Syria Robert Ford, covers his nose during his visit with other foreign... (Associated Press) Ambassador Robert Ford returned to Washington this weekend after the U.S. received \\"credible threats against his personal safety in Syria,\\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday. Ford has been the subject of several incidents of intimidation by pro-government thugs, and enraged Syrian authorities with his forceful defense of peaceful protests and harsh critique of a government crackdown that has now claimed more than 3,000 lives. \\"We hope that the Syrian regime will end its incitement campaign against Ambassador Ford,\\" Toner said. \\"At this point, we can't say when he will return to Syria.\\" Toner said the U.S. embassy will remain open in Damascus and that the threats were specifically directed toward Ford. His return is conditional on a U.S. \\"assessment of Syrian regime-led incitement and the security situation on the ground,\\" Toner said. Ford was the first American ambassador to Syria since 2005. President George W. Bush's administration withdrew a full-time ambassador from Syria over charges the country was involved in terrorism and the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Syria has denied any involvement. The Obama administration decided to return an ambassador to Syria earlier this year in an effort to persuade Syria to change its policies regarding Israel, Lebanon, Iraq and support for extremist groups. Syria is designated a \\"state sponsor of terrorism\\" by the State Department. Although Ford's appointment in January, while the Senate was out of session, was originally criticized by some Republicans in Congress, he has won praise within the administration and beyond for his determination to meet Syrian opposition leaders in a hostile environment, and tough criticism of the Assad regime's brutal military response to mass demonstrations. The Senate unanimously approved Ford's nomination earlier this month, with Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, praising Ford for continuing to visit cities under siege and \\"speak truth to power.\\" Ford was greeted by demonstrators with roses and cheers when he traveled to the restive city of Hama in July, prompting immediate recriminations from the Syrian government, which tried to then limit where Ford could travel. Only days later hundreds of regime supporters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, smashing windows and spray-painting obscenities on the walls. Ford also has been the subject of several incidents of intimidation by pro-government thugs, often in coordination with pro-Assad media capturing the humiliation. Media reports said Ford was hit with eggs and tomatoes while going to a mosque in Damascus. Other such incidents have occurred after meetings with dissident groups or individuals, and his postings on Facebook have provoked thousands of Syrian and other responses, and even some death threats from pro-Assad hardliners. Haynes Mahoney, the embassy's deputy chief of mission, confirmed that Ford has left Syria but said Washington hadn't not formally recalled him _ a symbolically significant diplomatic step. Toner lamented that the threats deprived the United States of a valuable emissary to the Syrian people at a time they face daily violence from Assad's security forces. Clashes on Sunday saw forces flood into villages where residents have been on strike and shoot two people dead, according to activists. President Barack Obama has called on the U.N. Security Council to sanction Syria for using deadly violence against citizens who are rising up against the authoritarian government there. A seasoned diplomat with extensive Middle East experience, Ford \\"has worked diligently to deliver our message and be our eyes on the ground\\" in Syria, Toner said. \\"This decision was based solely on the need to ensure his safety, a matter we take extremely seriously.\\" ___ AP writers Bassem Mroue in Beirut and Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, contributed to this report. ||||| In this file picture, new U.S. ambassador Robert Ford (R) talks with Syria's President Bashar al-Assad after presenting his credentials to Assad, in Damascus January 27, 2011. AMMAN The United States said on Monday it had pulled its ambassador out of Syria because of threats to his safety, prompting Syria to follow suit in a worsening of ties already tattered by U.S. opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's efforts to crush anti-government protests. The U.S. envoy, Robert Ford, had antagonized Syria's government with his high-profile support for the demonstrators trying to end 41 years of Assad family rule. Assad supporters attacked the U.S. Embassy and Ford's convoy in recent months. Ford left Syria as a government crackdown on protests and a nascent armed insurgency intensified and as more businesses and shops closed in southern Syria in the most sustained strike of the seven-month uprising. In the latest violence, two people were killed in the central city of Homs, 85 miles north of Damascus, when troops and loyalist militiamen fired at majority Sunni Muslim districts that have been a bastion for protests. The United States has called for Assad to step down and, along with its European allies, has intensified sanctions on Syria, including against its small but significant oil sector, a central source of foreign currency for the government. The State Department issued a statement saying Ford \\"was brought back to Washington as a result of credible threats against his personal safety in Syria.\\" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Ford was expected to return to Syria and demanded the Syrian government provide for his protection and end what she called a \\"smear campaign of malicious and deceitful propaganda\\" against him. \\"The concern here is that the kinds of falsehoods that are being spread about Ambassador Ford could lead to violence against him, whether it's by citizens, whether it's by ... thugs of one kind or another,\\" she said. Nuland stressed that Ford had not been \\"withdrawn\\" -- a diplomatically loaded term that could have implied that the envoy would not return and that suggests a diminution in relations between the two countries. \\"INCITEMENT\\" AGAINST ENVOY U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ford left Damascus on Saturday. A spokeswoman for the Syrian Embassy in Washington, Roua Sharbaji, said after news of Ford's return became public Syrian Ambassador Imad Moustapha had been recalled to Damascus for consultations on Monday. Unlike in Libya, there appears to be no appetite among Western or Arab governments to consider armed intervention to stop the violence in Syria, one of a host of Arab states to see uprisings against long-time authoritarian rulers this year. The killings in Homs on Monday bring to at least 10 the number of civilians killed in tank-backed assaults on districts in the central city in the last two days, activists said. The official Syrian news agency said \\"terrorist groups\\" had fired at a taxi carrying university students in Homs on Sunday night, killing a young woman. Security forces arrested several members of other groups and seized automatic weapons, automatic rifles and Molotov cocktails. A Youtube video shot by activists purportedly showed a young protester dying from a gunshot that hit him while he was dragging a body off a street in al-Khalidiya district. Their comrades are heard shouting \\"God is greater\\" as the two bodies lay next to each other on the asphalt. Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the footage. Most foreign media have been banned from Syria, making it difficult to verify events on the ground. Syrian authorities say they are fighting \\"armed terrorist groups\\" in Homs who have killed civilians, security forces and prominent figures. They blame the unrest across the country on such groups, which they say have killed 1,100 army and police. The United Nations says the crackdown has killed 3,000 people, including 187 children. ATTACKS ON U.S. EMBASSY, CONVOY Ford left Syria following a series of violent incidents that damaged the U.S. Embassy compound and his motorcade but did not cause any casualties. At the end of September, Assad loyalists threw concrete blocks at his convoy and hit the cars with iron bars as Ford was visiting centrist politician Hassan Abdulazim, according to an account published by the ambassador the next day. In July, several Assad loyalists broke into the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, tore down signs and tried to break security glass. They also tried to break into Ford's nearby residence but failed to gain entry. The Syrian government's mounting security crackdown has triggered a strike by private businesses in towns across the Hauran Plain, which was the first region where masses publicly turned against Assad. Anger has grown over the killings of several protesters last week in the towns of Dael and in Ibtaa. The region has seen nightly protests in solidarity with Homs. \\"Troops have entered into several towns to end the strike but protesters want to expand it into wider civil disobedience,\\" said one activist who said army reinforcements had been sent to several towns in the Deraa countryside. In Deraa city, capital of the agricultural province, businesses across the city were closed for the fourth day. In the town of al-Hirak to the east, the strike picked up steam in the last two days, activists said. \\"This strike is intensifying every day as more businesses shut and people become more defiant than ever, angered by the increasing brutality and daily roundups and arrests,\\" said one Deraa resident who gave his name as Abu Abdullah. With troops concentrating on urban centers, protests have expanded in rural regions, including some once bedrocks of Sunni support for Assad but now seeing defections from the military and armed resistance. In an interview with Reuters last month, Ford said Assad was losing support among key constituents and risked plunging Syria into sectarian strife between Sunnis and Alawites by intensifying the military crackdown. Ford also infuriated Syria's rulers with his high profile gestures of support for the seven-month-old grassroots protest movement seeking to oust Assad. He was cheered when he went in July to the anti-Assad hotbed city of Hama, which was later stormed by tanks, ignoring a ban on diplomats traveling outside the Damascus area.

Step-by-step justification: 1. Open the Dishwasher: This step remains unaffected by the perturbation. 2. Slide out the bottom rack: This step remains unchanged, as it's necessary to access the dishwasher's bottom rack. 3. Take a dirty plate: This step is still required; however, if dishes are loaded directly into the dishwasher after use, you might not need to pick up a dirty plate physically. Instead, the plate may have already been placed in the dishwasher after being used. 4. Rinse the plate: The perturbation, \\"Do not rinse the plate,\\" directly impacts this step. If dishes are loaded directly into the dishwasher after use, users may skip rinsing the plate as a time-saving measure. The assumption is that the dishwasher will be able to handle food particles left on the plate. 5.

Repeat, leaving enough space for water to reach all items: This step remains important regardless of the perturbation, as it's crucial to enable the dishwasher to clean all items effectively. 7. Fill the soap cup: This step is unchanged, as dishwasher detergent is necessary to clean the dishes. 8.

Wars of Edward III.--By the Salic law, as the lawyers called it, the crown was given, on the death of Charles IV., to _Philip, Count of Valois_, son to a brother of Philip IV., but it was claimed by Edward III. of England as son of the daughter of Philip IV. Edward contented himself, however, with the mere assertion of his pretensions, until Philip exasperated him by attacks on the borders of Guienne, which the French kings had long been coveting to complete their possession of the south, and by demanding the surrender of Robert of Artois, who, being disappointed in his claim to the county of Artois by the judgment of the Parliament of Paris, was practising by sorcery on the life of the King of France. Edward then declared war, and his supposed right caused a century of warfare between France and England, in which the broken, down-trodden state of the French peasantry gave England an immense advantage. The knights and squires were fairly matched; but while the English yeomen were strong, staunch, and trustworthy, the French were useless, and only made a defeat worse by plundering the fallen on each side alike. The war began in Flanders, where Philip took the part of the count, whose tyrannies had caused his expulsion. Edward was called in to the aid of the citizens of Ghent by their leader Jacob van Arteveldt; and gained a great victory over the French fleet at Sluys, but with no important result. At the same time the two kings took opposite sides in the war of the succession in Brittany, each defending the claim most inconsistent with his own pretensions to the French crown--Edward upholding the male heir, John de Montfort, and Philip the direct female representative, the wife of Charles de Blois. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. Who declared the war? 2. Who did the kings demand to be surrendered? 3. How man kings took opposite sides? 4. What is Edward III's relation to Philip IV? 5. What did the French kings wish to complete? 6. Was the French peasantry in good shape? 7. What kind of shape was it in? 8. Where did the war start? 9.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Gattaca Context: In \\"the not-too-distant\\" future, where genetic engineering of humans is common and DNA plays the primary role in determining social class, Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is conceived and born without the aid of this technology. Suffering from the nearly eradicated physical dysfunctions of myopia and a congenital heart defect, as well as being given a life expectancy of 30.2 years, Vincent faces extreme genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way he can achieve his life-long dream of becoming an astronaut is to break the law and impersonate a \\"valid\\", a person with appropriate genetic advantage.[4]He assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a former swimming star who, despite a genetic profile \\"second to none\\", won only a silver medal in a high-profile competition. He then attempted to commit suicide by jumping in front of a car, but again fell short of his goal in that he only succeeded in paralyzing himself from the waist down. However, as the incident occurred outside the country, no one knows of his newly acquired disability. Thus, Vincent can \\"buy\\" his identity with no one the wiser. Though he requires orthopedic surgery to increase his height, persistant practice to favor his right hand instead of his left, and contact lenses to replace his glasses while matching Jerome's eyes, he can use his \\"valid\\" DNA in blood, tissue and urine samples to pass any genetic test - as long as he takes extreme measures to leave no traces of his identity as an \\"in-valid\\". But, where he was once an object of scorn and pity, he is now a perpetrator of an unspeakable fraud. Legally, exposure would only subject him to fines, but socially the consequences would be far more extreme - he is now a heretic against the new order of genetic determinism. Vincent is now a \\"borrowed ladder\\" (a reference to the ladder structure of an un-coiled DNA strand) or in harsher language, a de-gene-erate.With Jerome's impressive genetic profile he easily gains access to the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation (his interview consists... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Gattaca, Vincent saves his brother Anton from drowning. The scene takes place during their childhood when Vincent and Anton, who are competitive siblings, engage in a game they call \\"chicken\\", where they swim out into the ocean to see who would give up and swim back to shore first. Despite Vincent's inferior genetic makeup and health issues, he demonstrates great determination and strong willpower which helps him beat his brother Anton in the swimming race. As a result, Vincent ends up saving Anton from drowning when Anton becomes exhausted and can no longer swim back on his own. This particular scene is significant because it challenges the notion of genetic determinism prevalent in the society presented in the film. Although Vincent is deemed as an \\"in-valid\\" due to his genetic makeup, his ability to save Anton, who possesses superior genes, from drowning proves that determination and the human spirit can transcend the limitations imposed by genetics. The act of saving Anton also provides Vincent with an increased sense of self-worth, which further motivates him to pursue his dreams of becoming an astronaut despite the societal barriers in place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rick Perry and his family have made presidential campaign trips aboard a jet owned by a wealthy contributor who is under investigation for possible securities fraud by Texas regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Perry, who has emerged in just weeks as the new frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, flew last weekend aboard Brian D. Pardo's Cessna Citation X jet from a remote Texas airport to various campaign events in Iowa, according to a Perry campaign aide and flight records obtained via Flightwise.com. Records showed that Pardo's plane also flew from Texas to Charleston, S.C., on Aug. 13, the day Perry announced his bid for the presidency there. Perry's campaign said the plane carried the governor's relatives to the campaign kickoff. Pardo, chief executive of Life Partners Holdings Inc. of Waco, Texas, last year donated 50,000 to Perry's Texas campaign fund. Life Partners is a major player in the controversial \\"life settlement\\" business, selling retail investors the right to collect on strangers' life-insurance policies. Texas regulators filed suit against Pardo and his company at the end of July in state court in Travis County, seeking to force them to comply with subpoenas issued amid an investigation of Life Partners. According to a statement from the securities regulators, the probe centers in part on suspected \\"fraudulent practices\\" in connection with the company's sale of its life-insurance investments. Mark Miner, a spokesman for Perry, declined to say how Pardo's plane came to be used by Perry but said \\"it was a plane we chose to use\\" and the owner was \\"paid in full in accordance with federal election laws.\\" Miner said he believed the governor knows Pardo but would not say what relationship, if any, the two have.

Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is Roland's religion?

If you treat the job as a temporary position by not giving your all and showing little commitment, you will be treated as a temp and not offered the opportunity to stay. Acting like a permanent employee means coming to work as if you already are one. The more normal and “at home” you feel, the more you will be seen as such by others. You can get started by doing the following: Show up on time Follow the rules Dress according to the dress code Make connections Share ideas Complete assigned tasks to the best of your ability You may not be expected to go above and beyond or even to do a good job. If you value a career opportunity, treat the position as if it is already permanent. Exceed expectations by doing the following: Show attention to detail, and keep mistakes to a minimum. Your supervisor will be relieved to know s/he won't have to go over your work or ask you to re-do it. Work overtime to complete projects that have strict deadlines. If your supervisor allows it, you will show dedication to the company by offering to work overtime. Participate in team meetings. Actively participate in team conversations by giving your opinions and sharing your ideas. This will show you truly want to contribute to team success. Volunteer and take initiative on special projects. Sometimes situations arise where certain team members are required to head up special projects. Do not let your temporary status get in your way. If you feel you can truly contribute to the project, volunteer! Your supervisor will appreciate your initiative. It is important to notify your supervisor that you are interested in permanent placement with the company. However, it is not good to keep talking about it, because you will seem annoying and pushy. When bringing this up to your supervisor you can choose to do the following: Express interest at the beginning of your employment. You can simply say, “I am excited to start working with you and hope my accomplishments will prove my ability to do this job on a permanent basis.” Remind your supervisor toward the middle of your specified time with the company, preferably after making a good contribution or completing a major project successfully. You can remind them by saying, “I really feel like I can succeed here. If I am offered this position permanently, I know I can contribute to more team successes.\\" Have a discussion with your supervisor a few weeks before your temp status ends. Use this time to be honest about your interest in a permanent position, and remind them of your successes. You can also ask about time-frames and notices, since you would need to seek other employment if they choose not to offer you the job permanently. There is no need to keep asking about a permanent job. Your desire has been made clear, and it is up to the company now. Most likely the decision will be made collectively with input from your co-workers, supervisor, HR and possibly upper-level management. Be patient. If you seem to fit in well and are the right person for the job, you will be offered the position.","completion":"Adopting a \\"just a temp\\" mindset can hinder your success and growth within a company. To increase your chances of being offered a permanent position, behave like a permanent employee from the start by showing commitment and dedication. This includes arriving on time, adhering to the company’s dress code, following rules, building connections, sharing ideas, and completing tasks to the best of your ability. To stand out and exceed expectations, focus on the quality of your work by being detail-oriented, reducing mistakes, and seeking opportunities to work overtime, especially on projects with strict deadlines. Participate actively in team meetings by sharing your thoughts and opinions, demonstrating your genuine desire to contribute towards the team's success. Show initiative by volunteering for special projects, even if your temporary status might make you hesitant. It's crucial to communicate your interest in a permanent position with your supervisor without being overbearing. Initially, express your enthusiasm and intention to prove your abilities. Remind your supervisor of your interest midway through the contract, highlighting your accomplishments. Lastly, discuss your interest in a permanent position a few weeks before your temp assignment ends, asking about time-frames and any required notices. Be patient with the decision-making process, as it may involve input from various sources, like co-workers, HR, and upper management. If you've proven to be a valuable asset to the company and the right fit for the position, you're likely to be offered a permanent job.

Given the question: Process: - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area - Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the summer is very wet happens, how will it affect There are fewer areas for animals to hide in. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would likely have an indirect effect on the process. Steps to justify: 1. Acknowledge the Perturbation Hypothesis: The scenario given is that there is a very wet summer. Generally, this implies increased rainfall and moisture in the environment. 2. The Effect on Forest Fires: Increased rainfall during a very wet summer could help to reduce the risk of forest fires as the moisture would make the vegetation less susceptible to burning. This is because moist or wet vegetation does not catch fire as readily as dry vegetation. 3. Considering the Process in Question: With a reduced risk of forest fires, the process as described would likely be disrupted. This is due to the fact that the initial step (forest fires burn forests) may not occur, or occur less often/severely, in this altered scenario. 4. Relating to the Concept of Fewer Places for Animals to Hide: Since the forest is less likely to burn in a very wet summer, the animals living in the forests would essentially retain their habitat. As such, there would not necessarily be fewer places for animals to hide, because their environment remains more or less intact. By extension, if there are no or fewer forest fires due to the very wet summer, then predators would not find their prey as easily because the normal hiding places of the animals stay intact and the forest remains dense. Birds might not fly away since their habitat is not threatened. Similarly, if there are no fires, water bodies wouldn't warm up due to the absence of heat from the fires, reducing potential harm to the aquatic life. Therefore, the perturbation proposed does have an effect on the process, even if it's indirect, as it changes the initial conditions leading to the consequences mentioned in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette!

World powers would go in with fighter jets and the world's most sophisticated precision-guided weapons to render Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi powerless. But that's not the way things happened. As NATO's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark, analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions, including success based solely on surgical airstrikes, for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months. \\"It's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this,\\" said Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation and director of Aberfoyle International Security, a Toronto-based agency specializing in security issues related to the Islamic world. The rebels, he said, have made noticeable gains with the support of OPTIONS: - Aberfoyle International Security air power. - Andrew McGregor air power. - CNN air power. - Islamic air power. - Jamestown Foundation air power. - Libyan air power. - Moammar Gadhafi air power. - NATO air power. - Toronto air power.","completion":"NATO air power. While the initial intention of the NATO-led intervention was to bring a swift end to the Gadhafi's regime through precision-guided airstrikes, the reality differed significantly. The protracted conflict did not strictly adhere to these plans and the instantaneous halting of Gadhafi's rule was not achieved as initially envisaged. This overstretched conflict exceeded the predicted short duration, stretching well past the 100-day mark and ignites fears of an ongoing war that could last for several months, if not years. Analysts have pointed to a series of flawed assumptions that contributed to this prolonged conflict. Perhaps the most criticized was the belief that a war could be won solely on the strength of surgical airstrikes. This particular approach was deemed to be fundamental in undermining Gadhafi's power, however, this wasn't the case. The Libyan leader proved resistant to such tactics, prolonging the standoff between his forces and the international efforts to displace him. Andrew McGregor, a noteworthy figure from the Jamestown Foundation and also director of Aberfoyle International Security, a security agency based in Toronto that specializes in security issues related to the Islamic world, is quite vocal on the issue. He categorically insists that it's a sheer misunderstanding to presume that victory could be obtained merely through an air campaign. Such a simplistic view overlooks the complex realities of warfare, particularly in a context such as Libya's. In response to the stalemate, rebels in Libya have made appreciable gains, which according to McGregor, are largely attributable to the support of NATO air power. The assistance from NATO has underscored the international commitment to dismantling the Gadhafi regime. While the air support has provided a significant boost, it's becoming increasingly clear that the solution to the Libyan crisis may not solely rest on air power but, instead, a holistic mix of diplomacy, ground operations and international pressure. However, the protracted conflict raises pertinent questions about the efficacy of relying heavily on air power in modern warfare. Most importantly, it cautions against the danger of simplifying complex scenarios into single-strategy solutions. It indicates a need for a more comprehensive approach to conflict resolution, integrating air power with other approaches such as diplomacy and ground operations. With this kind of diversity, there is a higher probability of achieving the desired outcome in a reasonable timeframe. This is a lesson not just for Libya, but for all future international conflict resolutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Achillas (Greek: Ἀχιλλᾶς ) was one of the guardians of the Egyptian king Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator, and commander of the king's troops, when Pompey fled to Egypt in 48 BC.

Julius Caesar called Achillas a man of extraordinary daring. 5. Achillas and Lucius Septimius killed Pompey at the suggestion of the eunuch Pothinus and Theodotus of Chios. Now, let's analyze the information: Achillas was a guardian of an Egyptian king and the commander of his troops. This information suggests that he held a high position in the Egyptian court and was involved in the Egyptian military, indicating a possible connection to Egypt. However, these facts alone do not explicitly state that Achillas was Egyptian. There is no mention of Achillas' nationality explicitly in the paragraph. The paragraph only provides information about his role in the Egyptian court and his involvement in the killing of Pompey. Step-by-step conclusion: 1. The paragraph provides information about Achillas' role in the Egyptian court and military. 2. Achillas' specific nationality is not mentioned. 3. While it is possible that Achillas was Egyptian due to his position and connection to Egyptian court, there is not enough explicit information to make a definitive conclusion. Based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively confirm that Achillas was from Egypt, as his nationality is not directly stated."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Yankovic was born in Downey, California and raised in Lynwood, California. He is the only child of Mary Elizabeth (Vivalda) and Nick Yankovic. His father was born in Kansas City, Kansas, of Yugoslavian descent, and began living in California after serving during World War II; he believed \\"the key to success\\" was \\"doing for a living whatever makes you happy\\" and often reminded his son of this philosophy. Nick married Mary in 1949. Yankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, typically which make up about half of his studio releases. Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman, Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody. In some cases, in requesting the original band to allow for his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler and Guy Fletcher perform on \\"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\\", Yankovic's parody of Dire Straits' \\"Money for Nothing\\", while Imagine Dragons provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for \\"Radioactive\\" in Yankovic's parody \\"Inactive\\". Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his \\"mainstream\\" parody targets, such as Toni Basil, MC Hammer, and Men Without Hats. Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single \\"White & Nerdy\\" and album Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music. Although many of Yankovic's songs are parodies of contemporary radio hits, it is rare that the song's primary topic lampoons the original artist as a person, or the song itself. Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the songs \\"Amish Paradise\\", \\"White & Nerdy\\", and \\"You're Pitiful\\"), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture cliches (such as \\"eBay\\" and \\"Don't Download This Song\\"). Yankovic's parodies are often satirical of popular culture, including television (see The TV Album), movies (\\"The Saga Begins\\"), and food (see The Food Album). Yankovic claims he has no intention of writing \\"serious\\" music. In his reasoning, \\"There's enough people that do unfunny music. I'll leave the serious stuff to Paris Hilton and Kevin Federline.\\" Yankovic considered that his first true satirical song was \\"Smells Like Nirvana\\", which references unintelligible lyrics in Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". Other satirical songs include \\"Achy Breaky Song\\", which refers to the song \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\", \\"(This Song's Just) Six Words Long\\", which refers to the repetitious lyrics in \\"Got My Mind Set on You\\", and \\"Perform This Way\\", set to Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way\\" that drew inspiration from Lady Gaga's outlandish but confident attitude. Yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs and, for \\"legal and personal reasons\\", does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans. There exists, however, one exception to this rule: Madonna was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when Yankovic was going to turn her \\"Like a Virgin\\" into \\"Like a Surgeon\\". Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What stood out in this article","completion":"This article talks about Yankovic, a talented artist known for creating parodies of popular songs.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The two sentences presented contain different pieces of information, so it is important to analyze them separately before addressing the question related to their truth values. Let's break down each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"And what are you doing?\\" This sentence is a general question asking the person what they are doing. It does not provide specific context regarding the situation, location, or person. It can be used in various scenarios to express curiosity or to seek clarification about someone's activity. The truth value of this sentence becomes clearer when the person to whom the question is directed provides an explanation or description of their current actions. Sentence 2: \\"What are you doing at her house?\\" In contrast, this sentence is a more specific question, implicating a particular location - \\"her house\\". This means someone is at a female's house, and the person asking wants to know the reason or activity taking place at that location. It seems to imply a curiosity or concern for the person being there, likely due to the specificity of mentioning \\"her house\\". Now, let's address the question: If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? While both sentences are questions and seek information about what someone is doing, their context and level of specificity vary. It is important to mention that questions themselves do not inherently contain truth values – they aim to gather information or obtain a response with a truth value. Thus, the original question about the truth values of the sentences might not be the most appropriate way to frame the analysis. However, we can discuss the nature of the relationship between the two sentences. If someone answers Sentence 1, it will not necessarily reveal any information about whether Sentence 2 is relevant or applicable to the situation. It is in the responses to these questions that truth values become relevant. So, the overall answer is that the truth value of Sentence 1 does not determine or influence the truth value of Sentence 2, simply because both sentences are questions that pertain to different situations and levels of specificity. Instead, it is the answers or responses to these questions that can be evaluated for truth rather than the questions themselves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Book Review - The History of White People - By Nell Irvin Painter - Review - NYTimes.com Nell Irvin Painter’s title, “The History of White People,” is a provocation in several ways: it’s monumental in sweep, and its absurd grandiosity should call to mind the fact that writing a “History of Black People” might seem perfectly reasonable to white people. But the title is literally accurate, because the book traces characterizations of the lighter-skinned people we call white today, starting with the ancient Scythians. For those who have not yet registered how much these characterizations have changed, let me assure you that sensory observation was not the basis of racial nomenclature. In order to view this feature, you must download the latest version of flash player Some ancient descriptions did note color, as when the ancient Greeks recognized that their “barbaric” northern neighbors, Scythians and Celts, had lighter skin than Greeks considered normal. Most ancient peoples defined population differences culturally, not physically, and often regarded lighter people as less civilized. Centuries later, European travel writers regarded the light-skinned Circassians, a k a Caucasians, as people best fit only for slavery, yet at the same time labeled Circassian slave women the epitome of beauty. Exoticizing and sexualizing women of allegedly inferior “races” has a long and continuous history in racial thought; it’s just that today they are usually darker-skinned women. “Whiteness studies” have so proliferated in the last two decades that historians might be forgiven a yawn in response to being told that racial divisions are fundamentally arbitrary, and that deciding who is white has been not only fluid but also heavily influenced by class and culture. In some Latin American countries, for example, the term blanquearse, to bleach oneself, is used to mean moving upward in class status. But this concept — the social and cultural construction of race over time — remains harder for many people to understand than, say, the notion that gender is a social and cultural construction, unlike sex. As recently as 10 years ago, some of my undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin heard my explanations of critical race theory as a denial of observable physical differences. I wish I had had this book to offer them. Painter, a renowned historian recently retired from Princeton, has written an unusual study: an intellectual history, with occasional excursions to examine vernacular usage, for popular audiences. It has much to teach everyone, including whiteness experts, but it is accessible and breezy, its coverage broad and therefore necessarily superficial. The modern intellectual history of whiteness began among the 18th-century German scholars who invented racial “science.” Johann Joachim Winckelmann made the ancient Greeks his models of beauty by imagining them white-skinned; he may even have suppressed his own (correct) suspicion that their statues, though copied by the Romans in white marble, had originally been painted. The Dutchman Petrus Camper calculated the proportions and angles of the ideal face and skull, and produced a scale that awarded a perfect rating to the head of a Greek god and ranked Europeans as the runners-up, earning 80 out of 100. The Englishman Charles White collected skulls that he arranged from lowest to highest degree of perfection. He did not think he was seeing the gradual improvement of the human species, but assumed rather the polygenesis theory: the different races arose from separate divine ­creations and were designed with a range of quality. The modern concept of a Caucasian race, which students my age were taught in school, came from Johann Friedrich Blumenbach of Göttingen, the most influential of this generation of race scholars. Switching from skulls to skin, he divided humans into five races by color — white, yellow, copper, tawny, and tawny-black to jet-black — but he ascribed these differences to climate. Still convinced that people of the Caucasus were the paragons of beauty, he placed residents of North Africa and India in the Caucasian category, sliding into a linguistic analysis based on the common derivation of Indo-European languages. That category, Painter notes, soon slipped free of any geographic or linguistic moorings and became a quasi-­scientific term for a race known as “white.” Some great American heroes, notably Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, absorbed Blumenbach’s influence but relabeled the categories of white superiority. They adopted the Saxons as their ideal, imagining Americans as direct and unalloyed descendants of the English, later including the Germans. In general, Western labels for racial superiority moved thus: Caucasian → Saxon → Teutonic → Nordic → Aryan → white/Anglo. Linda Gordon is a professor of history at New York University and the author, most recently, of Dorothea Lange: A Life Beyond Limits. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"\\"The History of White People\\" by Nell Irvin Painter presents a provocative examination of the evolution of the concept of \\"white\\" race. The book begins by tracing characterizations of lighter-skinned people, such as the ancient Scythians, and impresses upon readers that these understandings have significantly evolved and were not initially based on essentials like physical or sensory observation. Painter delineates how different civilizations defined racial groups more in terms of culture than physical attributes. For instance, in ancient Greece, Scythians and Celts were recognized as having lighter skin than what Greeks considered normal, but the Greeks still saw them as less civilized. Painter discusses how racial categories are permeable and are influenced heavily by class and culture, as seen in Latin American countries where the term 'blanquearse,' meaning 'to bleach oneself,' is a symbol of upgrading one's class status. The concept of race as a fluid social and cultural construct appears to be harder for people to grasp compared to the idea that gender is also socially and culturally constructed. The author has attempted to demystify this through her book. The book moves to the exploration of 18th-century German scholars who championed racial “science.” This includes the likes of Johann Joachim Winckelmann who idealized the ancient Greeks as models of beauty and imagined them with white skin. Other scholars such as Petrus Camper, Charles White, and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach each contributed to establishing hierarchies and categories of races based on their observations or beliefs, leading to the creation of a modern concept of a Caucasian race. Painter also points out that prominent figures such as Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, reshaped the categories of white superiority, fueling the transition from \\"Caucasian\\" to \\"Saxon,\\" and eventually to \\"Teutonic,\\" \\"Nordic,\\" \\"Aryan,\\" and \\"white/Anglo.\\" The review ends with the acknowledgement that the book presents a broad overview of a complex issue and manages to make the content comprehensible and engaging for the reader, marking a significant contribution within the realm of \\"whiteness studies.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Context: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher.

Intrigued by the little-known public information about Darren, she decides to attend his funeral to gather insights for her next feature story. At the funeral, Justine notices a group of people who appear unusual and out of place. They do not seem to be grieving, but rather whispering secrets amongst themselves. More curious than ever, Justine starts unraveling the hidden story of Darren Mullet's life and the secret lives of the people attending his funeral. As Justine digs deeper, she begins to understand that Darren was involved in some clandestine business deals. He had amassed a great fortune because of these endeavors, which created both allies and enemies.

A:","completion":"The common name of AL 288-1, on which Timothy Douglas White did his most famous work, is \\"Lucy.\\" Lucy is a collection of fossilized bones that make up about 40% of the skeleton of a female Australopithecus afarensis, an early hominin species. The fossils were discovered in 1974 in the Afar region of Ethiopia by a team of paleoanthropologists led by Donald Johanson, which included Timothy White. The name \\"Lucy\\" was inspired by the Beatles song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" which was playing at the team's campsite during celebrations following the discovery. Lucy is estimated to be around 3.2 million years old and has provided critical insights into human evolution, particularly in our understanding of bipedalism, the act of walking on two legs. The discovery of Lucy challenged earlier beliefs about the timeline of human evolution, showing that our ancestors were walking upright much earlier than previously thought. Timothy White's work on Lucy and other hominin fossils contributed significantly to the understanding of early human ancestors and their evolution into the Homo genus. He later became well-known for his research in human origins, paleoanthropology, and hominid evolution, as well as his work in other famous discoveries, such as the Ardi (Ardipithecus ramidus) fossils in Ethiopia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the name of the Tropic which lies approximately 23.5 degrees south of the Equator and runs through Australia, Chile, Brazil and South Africa?","completion":"The Tropic which lies approximately 23.5 degrees south of the Equator is called the Tropic of Capricorn. This imaginary line of latitude got its name because, at the time it was named, the sun was in the direction of the constellation Capricorn when it reached its southernmost point (this is no longer the case due to the precession of the equinoxes). The Tropic of Capricorn is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of Earth, the others being the Equator, the Tropic of Cancer, the Arctic Circle, and the Antarctic Circle. The Tropic of Capricorn marks the southernmost point where the sun can be directly overhead. This astronomical phenomenon occurs during the December solstice when the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. Conversely, during the June solstice, the sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere. The Tropic of Capricorn runs through several countries, including Australia, Chile, Brazil, South Africa, and others. In Australia, the line of latitude passes through the states of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, crossing iconic regions such as the Great Barrier Reef and the famous Australian Outback. In South America, the Tropic of Capricorn traverses Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. As it crosses Chile, it goes through a portion of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places in the world. In Brazil, it cuts through the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais, passing close to the city of São Paulo, one of the largest and most populous cities in the world. In Africa, the antumbra line runs through the island nation of Madagascar before crossing the southeastern portion of the African continent, passing through countries such as Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia. In South Africa, it crosses Kruger National Park, a renowned wildlife reserve and safari destination that is home to an impressive variety of African animal species. Throughout its journey across the planet, the Tropic of Capricorn experiences a wide range of climates, including deserts, savannas, rainforests, and coastal regions. In Australia, it brings together diverse ecosystems, while in South America, it spans dry deserts and fertile farmlands. In Africa, the line encounters both lush rainforests and arid savannas. The Tropic of Capricorn, along with the Tropic of Cancer, is essential in understanding the Earth's climatic and seasonal patterns.

Much to the relief of the art world and Hiorns' fans, the immersive installation has been saved from an unfortunate fate. Originally constructed in a council flat in London, the monumental work has not only received accolades for its creator, but has also become a compelling testimony to the power of art. The Artwork: Seizure Hiorns' Seizure is a unique and ambitious artwork, wherein an entire council flat was filled with 75,000 liters of liquid copper sulphate to create an otherworldly blue crystal environment. The astounding transformation took place when the liquid was allowed to form intricate crystalline structures along the walls, floors, and ceilings, fostering an alien landscape that captivated both critics and audiences alike. He often uses copper sulphate in his works as a subversive material, extending his overarching themes of scientific manipulation and the powerful influence of chemistry on our lives. The Turner Prize Nomination: Seizure's immediate impact on the art community led to Roger Hiorns being nominated for the Turner Prize in 2009. The Turner Prize, established in 1984, is an annual award presented to British visual artists that serves to recognize and promote innovative contemporary works. Inclusion in the shortlist of nominees is a notable honor, and earning such distinction for Hiorns highlighted the immense scale of Seizure's success. While ultimately, he did not emerge as the winner, it solidified his reputation as an avant-garde, experimental artist, and validated his ambitious and imaginative artwork. The Threat of Demolition: However, in the years that followed, Seizure's future faced uncertainty as the London council flat that housed the installation was slated for demolition. This recalcitrant artwork, grounded in its immense originality, was regarded as a symbol of resilience; yet, it risked having its lifespan tragically cut short by the forces of urban redevelopment. To lose such a celebrated piece would be to lose a critical piece of contemporary art history - an irreplaceable opportunity for future generations to experience Hiorns' groundbreaking vision. Saving Seizure: In an extraordinary effort by the Arts Council Collection and Artangel, Seizure was carefully relocated to Yorkshire Sculpture Park in Wakefield, where it was unveiled in 2013. A painstaking process, the delicate task of transferring the crystal-filled room to its new home demonstrated the dedication of all involved in preserving this one-of-a-kind artwork. The relocation successfully saved Seizure from the impending demolition while allowing it to continue to inspire and provoke thought among those who experience it. Conclusion: Roger Hiorns' Seizure not only showcases an artist's approach to combining chemistry and creativity, but also serves as a potent example of the enduring impact of contemporary art. It is a testament to the collective commitment of art enthusiasts, institutions, and Hiorns' own vision that Seizure was saved from the maws of demolition. Its survival signifies a triumph for contemporary art, emphasizing the significance of preserving and nurturing originality and creativity for generations to come."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Canada uses alternative methods to produce electricity while the US use more coal and oil. Both countries recently participated in a Global Warming Council. But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. What is an answer for this question: Which country uses fewer non-renewable resources? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, it appears that Canada uses fewer non-renewable resources compared to the United States. The background provided suggests that the United States primarily relies on fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, for electricity production. This method contributes to environmental issues such as air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Both fossil fuels and nuclear fission processes involve the use of limited, non-renewable resources. In contrast, Canada is described as utilizing alternative methods to produce electricity. Although the specific methods are not mentioned, it is reasonable to infer that these alternative methods likely involve renewable resources, such as hydroelectric, solar, or wind power. Renewable energy sources are more sustainable and environmentally friendly, as they do not contribute to the pollution and depletion of natural resources associated with fossil fuels and nuclear fission. Therefore, considering the information provided, Canada uses fewer non-renewable resources for its electricity production compared to the United States, which relies heavily on fossil fuels. This distinction showcases Canada's commitment to sustainable energy practices that maintain the integrity of the environment and natural resources for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its provisions are reflected in Article 29. There was a binding provision for a new delimitation of the federal territory: the Federal Territory must be revised ... (paragraph 1). Moreover, in territories or parts of territories whose affiliation with a Land had changed after 8 May 1945 without a referendum, people were allowed to petition for a revision of the current status within a year after the promulgation of the Basic Law (paragraph 2). If at least one tenth of those entitled to vote in Bundestag elections were in favour of a revision, the federal government had to include the proposal into its legislation. Then a referendum was required in each territory or part of a territory whose affiliation was to be changed (paragraph 3). The proposal should not take effect if within any of the affected territories a majority rejected the change. In this case, the bill had to be introduced again and after passing had to be confirmed by referendum in the Federal Republic as a whole (paragraph 4).

Alfred North Whitehead In fact, process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests. John B. Cobb, Jr. is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory. Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist. Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and political theory. In Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age, futurologists Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era. Q: Why is there difficulty in defining process theology ?","completion":"There is difficulty in defining process theology because: 1. Diversity of views: Process theologians hold diverse views and interpretations, which leads to various directions and understandings of the theology itself. 2. Transdisciplinary approach: Process theologians often come from different academic backgrounds and integrate their expertise with process theology. This results in a wide range of perspectives and cross-disciplinary practices that make it difficult to pin down a single, concise definition. For example: - John B. Cobb, Jr. has written books on biology and economics and incorporates those fields into his understanding of process theology. - Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead's ideas with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory. - Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist, which influenced his understanding of process theology. - Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and political theory, incorporating those disciplines in his approach to process theology. 3. Evolving nature: As new ideas and theories continue to develop, process theology adapts and incorporates these new insights, making it a constantly evolving and dynamic field. 4. Broadness of the concept: Process theology is based on a broad concept of understanding reality, which allows for varied interpretations and ideas to coexist within the framework. These factors contribute to the difficulty in defining process theology with a single, universally accepted definition. Instead, it remains a complex and multifaceted field that embraces diversity and interdisciplinary exploration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Add vibrant pinks, greens, or blues to the flyer so it stands out. For example, you could make the background of the flyer magenta or turquoise and add a vibrant-colored border around it. Contrasting colors are colors that are opposite on the color wheel. Colors that contrast make each other stand out, so incorporating them into your design can help people notice the flyer more easily. Some contrasting colors you could use are blue and orange, yellow and purple, and green and red. Try using only shades of blue or all reds. You don't have to use a lot of colors for the flyer to catch people's attention; people just want to look at something aesthetically pleasing. You can achieve that with one eye-catching color. A high-quality photo will get people's attention, just make sure it's relevant to the event. Avoid using photos that are blurry or low-quality.

Question: What does Russell emerge with a week after the robbery? Movie title: Inside Man Movie plot: Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), seated in what appears to be a jail cell, opens the film with a prologue about having carried out the \\"perfect robbery\\". A team of masked robbers, dressed as painters who call each other by variants of the name \\"Steve\\", seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the employees and patrons hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms. Additionally, they take all of the hostages' clothes and dress everyone in jumpsuits and masks identical to those of the robbers. This way, the robbers and hostages will be indistinguishable to the police. Police surround the bank and detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) take charge of the negotiations. Russell, the leader of the robbers, demands food. The police supply pizzas whose boxes include listening devices; these pick up a language which the police finally identify as Albanian. However, they discover that the conversations are just old propaganda recordings of the deceased Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha; it becomes clear that the robbers anticipated surveillance. After being informed of the robbery, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), the chairman of the board of directors and founder of the bank, hires \\"fixer\\" Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to try to protect the contents of his safe deposit box within the bank. White, with assistance from the Mayor of New York City, arranges a conversation with Russell, who allows her to enter the bank and inspect the contents of the box, which include documents from Nazi Germany. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in the deaths of many Jewish people during World War II.

A:","completion":"James Wilson was a prominent Scottish businessman, economist, and politician who played a vital role in the United Kingdom's political and financial landscape during the 19th century. Born on 3 June 1805 in Hawick, Roxburghshire, Scotland, Wilson's passion for economics and politics would guide him to a successful career spanning several important positions in government. Despite the lack of a formal education from an alma mater, Wilson demonstrated his prowess in the realm of economics. He gained widespread recognition after founding The Economist in 1843, a publication which remains highly influential to this day. This accomplishment would serve as a springboard for his political career, and he became a respected Whig Liberal Party member during the reign of Queen Victoria. In January 1853, Wilson was appointed Financial Secretary to the Treasury, working under Prime Minister Earl of Aberdeen. He would later hold the position of Vice-President of the Board of Trade under Prime Minister Viscount Palmerston. Concurrently, he served as the Paymaster-General from 18 June 1859 until 12 August 1859. Wilson's tenure in these roles was marked by his expertise and commitment to the economic stability of the country. During his career, Wilson had the opportunity to work with and succeed notable contemporaries, such as George Alexander Hamilton, Lord Lovaine, and Hon. William Cowper. This allowed him to further shape economic policies in the UK and strengthen his reputation as a skilled economist and politician. On a personal front, Wilson was married to Elizabeth Preston, with whom he shared his life. His legacy as an influential figure was immortalized in a portrait by Sir John Watson-Gordon, titled \\"A Gordon,\\" which was published in \\"The Pursuit of Reason: Portrait of The Economist 1843-1993.\\" The portrait was presented to Mrs. Wilson in 1859 by the Royal Scottish Academy. Tragically, Wilson's life took a sudden turn when he passed away on 11 August 1860 in Calcutta, India. Despite his untimely death, Wilson's contributions to the fields of economics and politics remain celebrated and are often seen as the groundwork for major advancements in the United Kingdom. Today, his memory is preserved through his portrait and the continued success of The Economist, serving as a testament to his undeniable impact on the financial and political spheres in not only the United Kingdom but also the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on \\"fairy life\\", and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the... Guess a valid title for it!

So, the lumberjack thought of a clever idea. He decided to cut the wood into smaller pieces so that they would fit through the door. He took out his trusty saw and started sawing the wood.

Once he had cut the wood into smaller pieces, he carefully picked them up and carried them to the shed door. With a gentle push, the lumberjack managed to fit each piece of wood through the door and into the shed. He did this over and over until all the pieces were inside. The lumberjack happily looked at his neat pile of wood in the shed, ready for use.

Context: A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters. He served as a counselor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a professor at Johns Hopkins University. Brzezinski went on to ruffle the feathers of Washington's power elite with his 1983 book, \\"Power and... Question: When did Brzezinski help President carter?

Q: what is the sum of the protons and neutrons in an atom? A:","completion":"To find the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom, we need to know the atomic number (number of protons) and the atomic mass of the element (the sum of protons and neutrons). Without this information, it is impossible to directly provide an answer. However, here is a step-by-step explanation to find the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom: Step 1: Determine the element. - Ask for the name or symbol of the element in question. Step 2: Identify the atomic number. - The atomic number (Z) is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It also determines the element's position in the periodic table. Step 3: Find the atomic mass. - The atomic mass (A) is the summed total of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. This can be found below the symbol of the element on the periodic table. Step 4: Calculate the number of neutrons. - Subtract the atomic number (number of protons) from the atomic mass, i.e., Neutrons = Atomic Mass (rounded to the nearest whole number) - Atomic Number (Z). Step 5: Add the protons and neutrons. - Add the atomic number (protons) and the neutron number to get the sum of protons and neutrons in the atom, i.e., Protons + Neutrons = Atomic Number (Z) + Neutron Number.

What are the stages of evolution of public administration? Step 1: Research the historical development of public administration. Public administration has evolved through various stages since its early days. These stages are: a) Classical Era (1887-1926): This period is marked by the founding of the discipline, with Woodrow Wilson's essay, \\"The Study of Administration,\\" advocating separating politics from administration. Main contributors to the field during this era include Max Weber, Frederick Taylor, and Henri Fayol. b) Human Relations Movement (1927-1950): This period focused on the study of human behavior in organizations, emphasizing the importance of interpersonal relationships and social factors. The Hawthorne Experiments led by Elton Mayo were significant in this era. c) Behavioral Approach (1951-1970): During this phase, the focus shifted towards a more comprehensive understanding of individual and group behavior in organizations. Researchers like Simon, March, and Selznick were instrumental during this period. d) Public Administration as a Science (1971-1990): The discipline achieved a concrete status as an academic field during this phase, as researchers aimed to establish a more scientific approach to the study of public administration. e) New Public Management (1990-2000): This era saw a widespread adoption of market-based techniques and the introduction of public-private partnerships, emphasizing efficiency and customer orientation in public administration. f) Public Governance (2000-Present): In this phase, public administration emphasizes a more democratic approach, collaboration, and co-production involving citizens and stakeholders for better public decisions, processes, and outcomes. 2. What is Public Administration? What is the main principle? Step 1: Research and define Public Administration. Public Administration is the organization, management, and implementation of public policies, programs, and services carried out by government agencies and public servants at various levels to meet the needs of society. Step 2: Identify the main principle of Public Administration. The main principle of Public Administration is to serve the public interest by directing resources, managing organizations, and implementing policies in an efficient, effective, and transparent manner, aiming to achieve the collective goals set by society. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Step 1: Compare the questions to check for similarity. The first question asks about the stages of evolution of public administration, the second question asks for the definition and main principle of public administration. These inquiries are different, as the first question focuses on the historical development, while the second question addresses the definition and core principle. Step 2: Determine whether the questions have the same meaning. Based on the comparison, these questions do not have the same meaning. They pertain to distinct aspects of public administration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Ottavio's marriage troubled Alessandro; he struggled with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost.

He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\\"?

Trump delivered a scathing attack on Hillary Clinton’s record on Wednesday, accusing her of being a “world-class liar” and incompetent while trying to lay out a positive vision for America in a major speech intended to put his sputtering presidential campaign back on the offensive. The remarks came amid a rough stretch for Mr. Trump, who this week fired his campaign manager, reported weak fund-raising numbers and was trailing Mrs. Clinton in most polls. Seeking to regain his footing, he unleashed a torrent of criticism at his rival interspersed with his own policy proposals. “Hillary Clinton wants to be president, but she doesn’t have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump assailed Mrs. Clinton for supporting trade policies that he said harmed American workers, and said that as secretary of state she was responsible for the creation of the Islamic State and for chaos in the Middle East. He explicitly blamed Mrs. Clinton for the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, calling her a liar who ignored his requests for help. “Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched,” he said. Mr. Trump’s own policies have been under siege recently, as Mrs. Clinton has taken him on more aggressively. Last week, Mrs. Clinton said that he was not fit to have his hands on the country’s nuclear codes, and on Tuesday she warned that his business record suggested that he would sink the nation’s economy if he was elected president. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, delivered a speech in New York on Wednesday, in which he went after Hillary Clinton on emails, Benghazi and the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Trump rebutted those assertions during his speech in New York on Wednesday, describing himself as a humble entrepreneur. “I started off in Brooklyn, New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion,” said Mr. Trump, who actually got a 1 million loan from his father decades ago. “I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.” He added, “That is a talent our country desperately needs.” The speech represented Mr. Trump’s most high-profile performance since he reset his campaign by firing Corey Lewandowski, his campaign manager, on Monday morning. Since Mr. Lewandowski’s departure, Mr. Trump has unveiled a more active rapid response operation and announced a wave of new hires. Some of Mr. Trump’s policy proposals were more tempered than they have been in other venues. When discussing the influx of refugees from the Middle East, he did not mention his provocative ban on Muslim migration. And instead of calling Muslims complicit in terrorist acts, he said that most of them were innocent victims. “ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality — and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety,” Mr. Trump said, using another name for the Islamic State. Mr. Trump, who regularly paints a dire picture of America’s declining stature, tried to adopt a more hopeful tenor when describing the kind of president he would be. He argued that he, not Mrs. Clinton, would improve the predicaments of the poor and minorities. “We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions,” Mr. Trump said. “We lost our sense of purpose, and daring. But that’s not who we are.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Donald Trump has labeled Hillary Clinton a \\"world-class liar,\\" blaming her for the rise of ISIS, the death of Ambassador J.

If the biologists predict a decrease in deer birth rates are there a high amount of resources or low amount of resources? A team of biologists has been monitoring the deer population in the state of Wisconsin. They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable. Hint: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Question: Who got a law degree? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"Desmond Meade got a law degree."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years. Whether such a deal can be done, Trump declared on Saturday, is something he will know almost... Who is feeling 'very good' about the summit? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A.

This indicates that the focus is on understanding the impact of program activities on the results, without any mention of intent to prevent altering the results. Step 2: Compare the hypothesis with the premise The hypothesis is about making sure the results are not altered, which is slightly different from the focus of the premise – using scientific research methods to estimate the impact of program activities on the results. Step 3: Evaluate the options A) yes - This option implies that the hypothesis is true, but we don't have enough information from the premise to directly confirm this.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person who applied to an art academy in St. Petersburg in 1909? Answer the above question based on the context below: Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic...

THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA (2007) **** If Loving Cinema Makes Me A Pervert, So Be It! If you are a true 'moviefreak' like me then I'm sure you can't get enough of films about film-making and I don't mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then. I mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience. Well if that's the case have I got a lulu of a film experiment for you. In Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph & Joseph if you were wondering) has noted philosopher cum cinephile Slavoj Zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive (and often outrageous) takes on everything from the silent era of Chaplin thru the modern age of the Wachowski Brothers analyzing, probing, and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings, socioeconomic, political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging, determined and near-frenetic dissertations. To go from explaining how The Bates' house in PSYCHO is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted Norman Bates with each level as his Ego, Superego & Id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each Marx Brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman. Although I had no idea who Zizek was  he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese  with his sibilant tongue and passion, the host comes across as a mad prophet. Fiennes cleverly inserts Zizek into several of the film clips' backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and films as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES, and FIGHT CLUB. There's something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film's themes  even if they are Freudian/Jungian to a fault  then I say this collection of film theory is worth the watch.

We also have fiction by Joseph Finder, Michael Stanley, and John Floyd. Lisa Unger gave the Strand an exclusive interview where she spoke about her suspense novels and shared her extensive knowledge of the craft of writing. ||||| Williams is best known as the author of such plays as A Streetcar Named Desire and The Glass Menagerie A previously unseen short story by US writer Tennessee Williams, inspired in part by an old college girlfriend, has been published for the first time. Crazy Night refers to a student named Anna Jean - a reference to Anna Jean O'Donnell, whom Williams briefly dated while at the University of Missouri. Williams wrote poetry about O'Donnell but only made passing mention to her in his notebooks and memoirs. The short story features in the spring edition of literary journal The Strand. According to its managing editor Andrew Gulli, the story, believed to have been written in the 1930s, could be \\"the missing piece of the puzzle\\" surrounding Williams' formative romantic liaison. The writer would go on to use his mother Edwina as the model for Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire and based the character of Laura Wingfield in The Glass Menagerie on his sister Rose. In Crazy Night, the narrator, a college freshman on an unnamed campus, has an intimate encounter with Anna Jean only to lose her to another student. The title of the story refers to a college ritual during which students are expected to binge on alcohol and sex. ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — Before his mother became the model for Blanche DuBois of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" and his sister the inspiration for Laura Wingfield of \\"The Glass Menagerie,\\" Tennessee Williams drew upon a college girlfriend — if only in name — to tell a story of desire, drunkenness and regret. FILE - This Nov. 11, 1940 file photo shows playwright Tennessee Williams at his typewriter in New York. \\"Crazy Night\\", a work of short fiction by Williams will be printed in the spring issue of The Strand... (Associated Press) \\"Crazy Night\\" is a work of short fiction unseen by the general public until this month's release in the spring issue of The Strand Magazine, a quarterly based in Birmingham, Mich. The story is narrated by a college freshman who confides about his romance with a senior, Anna Jean. Williams, while attending the University of Missouri at Columbia, briefly dated fellow student Anna Jean O'Donnell and wrote poetry about her. \\"It ('Crazy Night') seems to have been written when Williams was rather young, probably around the 1930s,\\" said Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, who has previously unearthed works by Mark Twain, Joseph Heller and Robert Louis Stevenson. \\"The funny thing is that Williams in his notebooks and memoirs went into a lot of detail about his love affairs but with Anna Jean he made only a passing mention. Could this be the missing piece of the puzzle?\\" Gulli found the story in the University of Texas at Austin's Harry Ransom Center, one of the country's top literary archives. \\"Crazy Night\\" is set on an unnamed campus in the early '30s, after the stock market crash of October 1929 and before the 1933 repeal of Prohibition, when \\"students graduating or flunking out of college had practically every reason for getting drunk and little or nothing that was fit to drink.\\" The title refers to a ritual at the end of spring term during which students are expected to binge on alcohol and sex, a bacchanal \\"feverishly gay\\" on the surface but \\"really the saddest night of the year.\\" \\"There is a theme of disappointment, the old 'mendacity theme' from 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'\\" Gulli says. \\"He could show how beneath the cloak of respectability his characters had horrible insecurities and dark secrets. Williams was a master of showing the desperation and need humans have for companionship and was equally skilled at showing how relationships go sour and lead to cynicism.\\" Williams was celebrated for his plays, but he wrote short stories for decades, many appearing in the 1985 anthology \\"Tennessee Williams: Collected Stories.\\" In the book's introduction, Williams' friend Gore Vidal wrote that the stories were essentially a fictionalized diary for Williams, who died in 1983. \\"Whatever happened to him, real or imagined, he turned into prose,\\" Vidal wrote. \\"Except for occasional excursions into fantasy, he sticks pretty close to life as he experienced or imagined it. No, he is not a great short story writer like Chekhov but he has something rather more rare than mere genius. He has a narrative tone of voice that is wholly convincing.\\" Williams' language in \\"Crazy Night\\" is sensual and romantic, with the kind of dramatic turns of phrase that Blanche DuBois might have used, whether referring to a \\"black cloud of incipient terror\\" in the narrator's mind or savoring the night air that \\"came in cool and sweet, faintly scented with a flowering vine.\\" Even in more restrictive times, Williams wrote openly about sex, and \\"Crazy Night\\" includes a scene in which male students, most of them freshmen and virgins, are brought into a room and paired off with girls. \\"It was handled in a very businesslike manner,\\" Williams wrote, \\"almost like vaccination the first day of school, each boy being allowed about five minutes, going in sort of white and trembling and coming out very loud and excited with a sheepish look on his face — indicating quite plainly the difference between an initial success or failure in the sexual skirmish.\\" According to Williams' memoir, published in 1975, he and O'Donnell had a \\"poignant and innocent little affair.\\" In his poem \\"To Anna Jean,\\" he calls her a \\"well-staged play, with lights and screens,\\" a description that could have applied to Blanche and other Williams heroines. In \\"Crazy Night,\\" the narrator loses Anna Jean to another student, but not before they enjoy \\"the ultimate degree of intimacy.\\" \\"Both her arms were lifted toward me,\\" Williams writes. \\"I had fallen between them. And the rest of what happened between us was a blind thing, almost involuntary, drawing from us both something that seemed hardly a part of ourselves.\\" ___ Online: http://www.strandmag.com/ ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The spring issue of the Strand features a previously unpublished short story by literary legend Tennessee Williams.

Alongside the work of Williams, the Strand issue also features fiction by Joseph Finder, Michael Stanley, and John Floyd, as well as an exclusive interview with author Lisa Unger, where she discusses her suspense novels and shares her extensive knowledge of the craft of writing.

Chesley Sullenberger was born in Denison, Texas, His father was a descendant of Swiss-German immigrants named Sullenberger. He has one sister, Mary. The street on which he grew up in Denison was named after his mother's family. According to his sister, Sullenberger built model planes and aircraft carriers during his childhood, and says he became interested in flying after seeing military jets from an Air Force base near his house. Sullenberger was employed by US Airways and its predecessor airlines from 1980 until 2010. (Pacific Southwest Airlines was acquired by US Air, later US Airways, in 1988.) He holds an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate for single and multi-engine airplanes, and a Commercial Pilot Certificate rating in gliders, as well as a flight instructor certificate for airplanes (single, multi-engine, and instrument), and gliders. In total, he has more than 40 years and 20,000 hours of flying experience. In 2007, he became the founder and CEO of Safety Reliability Methods, Inc.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Can you be too beautiful? It is hardly a problem that most of us have to bother -- as much as we might like to dream that it were the case. Yet the blessings and curses of beauty have been a long-standing interest in psychology. Do those blessed with shiny faces and an attractive body live in a cloud of appreciation -- or does it sometimes pay to be ordinary? Combing through decades of findings, social psychologists Lisa Slattery Walker and Tonya Frevert at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte havereviewed all the evidence to dateand their conclusions are not what you might expect. At the most basic level, beauty might be thought to carry a kind of halo around it; we see that someone has one good quality, and by association, our deep mind may assume that they have other good ones too. Even in the courts, a pleasing appearance can work its magic. Attractive criminals are likely to get less strict sentences, or to escape punishment entirely; attractive plaintiffs , meanwhile, are more likely to win their case and get bigger financial settlements. \\"It's an effect seen everywhere,\\" says Walker. But if beauty pays in most circumstances, there are still situations where it can have opposite results. While attractive men may be considered better leaders, for instance, hidden sexist prejudices can work against attractive women, making them less likely to be hired for high-level jobs that require power. And as you might expect, good-looking people of both sexes run into envy -- one study found that if you are interviewed by someone of the same sex, they may be less likely to employ you if they judge that you are more attractive than they are. More worryingly, being beautiful or handsome could harm your medical care. We tend to link good looks to health, meaning that illnesses are often taken less seriously when they affect the good-looking. When treating people for pain, for instance, doctors tend to take less care over the more attractive people. And the bubble of beauty can be a somewhat lonely place. One...

Answer the following question: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

The reviewer goes on to describe different aspects of the album which they find deeply flawed, such as the \\"horrible melodies,\\" \\"juvenile lyrics,\\" and \\"unlistenable songs.\\" These descriptions further reinforce the negative tone of the review. Additionally, the reviewer goes beyond critiquing the content of the album, assigning blame for its quality on the band members themselves, particularly Mike Love, who is described along with his collaborators as a \\"cast of idiots.\\" This personal criticism intensifies the disapproval of the album and demonstrates the strength of the author's distaste for the product. Towards the end, the author maintains their negative stance, even when discussing how much they appreciate the Beach Boys as a band. The reviewer implies that this particular album is not reflective of the band's potential and portrays it as a disappointing outlier.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer: What island do lemurs come from?","completion":"Lemurs are native to the island of Madagascar, a large island off the southeastern coast of Africa. Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world, approximately 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 570 kilometers (350 miles) wide, encompassing an area of 587,041 square kilometers (226,658 square miles). The island formed around 88 million years ago when it separated from the Indian subcontinent, resulting in a unique, isolated ecosystem that fostered the development of many endemic species. As distinctive primates, lemurs can only be found in the wild on Madagascar and the nearby Comoros Islands, where they have been introduced. There are approximately 100 species and subspecies of lemurs known today, ranging from the tiny mouse lemur (Microcebus) to the large indri (Indri indri). These diverse creatures play a crucial role in the ecology of Madagascar, as they serve as both pollinators and seed dispersers. Lemurs are arboreal animals, meaning they primarily live in trees and are most active in the rainforests, deciduous forests, and spiny forests that cover Madagascar's diverse terrain. They typically feed on fruits, leaves, flowers, and other vegetation, although some species, such as the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), also consume insects and other small creatures. One of the most prominent features of lemurs is their social nature. Many species live in groups called troops, which are often matriarchal – females hold dominant positions over males. Lemurs use a wide range of vocalizations, scent markings, and physical gestures to communicate with each other, and they have developed complex social structures within their groups. Sadly, lemurs are considered among the most endangered mammals on the planet, mainly due to habitat loss caused by deforestation, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. Madagascar's booming human population has led to increased agricultural practices and logging, resulting in severe deforestation that puts the unique flora and fauna, including lemurs, at risk. Conservation efforts are underway to help preserve and protect Madagascar's lemurs and their habitats. National parks, such as Ranomafana and Andasibe-Mantadia, and private reserves like the Anja Community Reserve, have been established to protect Madagascar's unique biodiversity and provide tourists the opportunity to observe lemurs and other wildlife in their natural habitats. Organizations like the Lemur Conservation Foundation, Madagascar Fauna and Flora Group, and the Duke Lemur Center also contribute to lemurs' preservation through research, habitat restoration, and education programs. In conclusion, lemurs are fascinating primates that originate from the island of Madagascar and the nearby introduced populations in the Comoros Islands. Their unique characteristics, distinct social behavior, and important ecological roles make them a crucial element of Madagascar's unparalleled ecosystem. While they continue to face substantial threats, conservation efforts are ongoing to ensure the future survival of these marvelous animals."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

You will simply have to look the cash machine straight in the eye, declares National Cash Registers, a multinational company that makes automated teller machines, or ATMs. NCR has shown its first example machine that is believed to be the future of banking. Instead of asking you for your PIN on a screen, the Super Teller-Stella for short, asks you orally through a loudspeaker to look straight ahead while an infrared camera turns to your head, then your eye, and finally takes an infrared photograph of your iris . For identification purposes, an iris picture is better than a fingerprint, with around 256 noticeable characteristics compared with 40 for fingerprints. This means that the chances of someone else being recognized in your place is about 1 in 1020. Once you've been identified, Stella greets you by name and says: \\"Would you like cash or a statement?\\" An infrared port allows the machine to send a bank statement straight to your pocket computer. Question: When you want to get cash out in the 21st century, you will _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"just look directly at the teller machine\\"?","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"just look directly at the teller machine.\\" In the 21st century, as mentioned in the article about the Super Teller-Stella ATM by National Cash Registers (NCR), a revolutionary method of identification at ATMs is expected to replace the need for bank cards and PINs. Instead, users simply have to look straight at an infrared camera that takes a photograph of their iris for identification purposes. Iris recognition is said to be more accurate than fingerprint identification due to its higher number of noticeable characteristics – 256 compared to 40. With this advanced technology, the chances of someone being mistakenly recognized in another person's place are extremely slim – around 1 in 10^20. Once the ATM identifies the user by their iris, it greets them by name and offers options for cash withdrawal or receiving a bank statement. The statement can even be sent directly to a user's pocket computer through an infrared port built into the machine. This innovation in the banking industry aims to provide more convenience, security, and ease of use for customers accessing their bank accounts and cash."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Police arrest second suspect for murder of Boy Scout leader Police collared a second suspect late Tuesday in connection with the murder of an Anaheim, Calif., man killed after he confronted some vandals in his neighborhood — and this time, they believe they got the right man. Edgar Ramirez, 20, is now facing charges for the brutal murder of Dave Douglas earlier this month, reported the Orange County Register. Douglas, 51, a Boy Scout leader, church volunteer and active community member, was shot multiple times about 10 p.m. on July 19, after he reportedly told a group of young taggers to stop defacing a property. The first suspect, David Steven Ortega, was taken into custody on July 21, but the 32-year-old convicted felon was later released when the District Attorney’s Office refused to press charges. Investigators now say they have finally nabbed the bad guy. Authorities said they found evidence linking Ramirez to the crime, though they would not provide details. A homeless man was attacked in Anaheim Sunday — one week after Douglas’ murder — in another tagging incident gone bad. James Blue, 51, was sorting scrap metal in his pickup truck when he saw four hoodlums spraying graffiti on a building. When he told them to scram, the angry taggers beat and stabbed him. Blue survived the attack but was left paralyzed from the waist down, his wife Sandra Blue said. Anaheim authorities said they have not made a connection between the two incidents. Ramirez has a prior felony conviction, according to Orange County court records. He pleaded guilty to felony vandalism in March 2014, and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of disturbing school activities in November 2012. Ramirez is being held in county jail with a 1 million bail and was expected to appear in court Thursday, according to jail records.

Paula Deen staged a comeback on Sunday which appeared to involve swigging from a tequila bottle and riding piggy-back style on the back of fellow TV chef Robert Irvine. The disgraced. Food Network star turned a cooking demo at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival in Miami this weekend into a public apology for the racist comments that. decimated her career last year. Before cooking chicken and dumplings, Deen mopped her brow and asked the. crowd if they minded if she talked about something serious for a moment. Without ever explicitly discussing the allegations or comments she has. admitted making, she said she was glad to be back and that, 'I am not a. quitter.' Scroll down for video. Celebrity chef Paula Deen was pictured swigging from a tequila bottle during a live cooking presentation for the South Beach Wine & Food Festival in Miami Beach on Sunday. Deen mops her brow as she performs a cooking demonstration of chicken and dumplings on Miami Beach on Sunday. The controversial chef, who was dropped by the Food Network and many sponsors after she made racist remarks, also hitched a ride on the back of fellow chef Robert Irvine. It was her first major public speech. since private equity firm Najafi Companies invested a reported 75 to. 100 million into new company Paula Deen Ventures earlier this month to. help the celebrity chef revitalize her career. 'We have come off of a very hard. summer my family and I, my team, my partners,' she said to a cheering. crowd of several hundred fans. 'But you know, I have heard on more than. one occasion ... that I've never apologized. So if anybody did not hear. me apologize, I would like to apologize to those who did not hear me.' The chef, known for her calorie-laden, Southern cooking, then launched into a bizarre, on-stage performance. At one point, she mentioned the rows of. empty seats in the audience, something she has never seen before at the festival she has taken part in since 2005. She also yelled out to some people. who walked out during the show: 'Hey wait were not done! Where ya'll. goin?' Paula Deen, pictured with her husband Michael Groover, made one of her first public appearances since she was disgraced in June 2013 when it was found she had used the 'N' word. Feeling the heat: The celebrity chef was dropped by her major sponsors following her use of racist language. During the cooking demo, Deen yelled out to some people who walked out during the show, 'Hey wait were not done! Where ya'll goin?' Deen's. career has been in shambles following a one-two punch of public. relations disasters. In 2012, she was criticized for announcing she had. both diabetes and a lucrative endorsement deal for a drug to treat the. condition she'd until then hidden. Then last. summer, during a legal dispute with a former employee who accused her of. racial discrimination and sexual harassment, she acknowledged having. used racial slurs, including the N-word, in the past. Most of her endorsement, book and TV. deals fell apart within days. Deen has mostly. stayed out of the spotlight since then, even avoiding the Food Network's. 20th anniversary party last October. But lately, she has made it clear. she wants back. Giddy up: Deen mounted Food Network star Robert Irvine at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival to announce her career resurgence. Earlier this month, she announced that private. investment firm Najafi Companies is investing 75 million to 100. million to help her make a comeback. As part. of the deal, she's launching an umbrella company, Paula Deen Ventures,. that will oversee her restaurants, cookbooks and product endorsements. And Sunday's crowd seemed primed for it all, shouting out to her: 'You. don't need to apologize!' and 'We want you back, Paula!' 'Ya'll's cards and letters that I got, helped me get out of bed every day' she replied. Midway. through the demo, Food Network star Robert Irvine joined Deen onstage.

Finger lickin' good: Deen announced earlier this month that she would be making a comeback thanks to a 75 -100 million investment. Deen is launching an umbrella company that will oversee her restaurants, cookbooks and product endorsements. Irvine survived his own scandal in in 2008 when the Food Network let him. go over discrepancies in claims he'd made over his work experience. He. eventually returned to the Network, seemingly unblemished. 'This. is a warning to you,' Irvine told Deen. 'You've apologized. You've. eaten crow. You're done. Don't do it anymore. I've been there.' Before. a roaring crowd, Irvine then got down on his hands and knees while Deen. straddled his back and rode him across the stage, a reenactment of a. gimmick they'd done during a previous festival.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: James Hudson Taylor (Chinese: Dai De Sheng ; 21 May 1832 - 3 June 1905) was a British Protestant Christian missionary to China and founder of the China Inland Mission (CIM, now OMF International). Taylor spent 51 years in China. The society that he began was responsible for bringing over 800 missionaries to the country who began 125 schools and directly resulted in 18,000 Christian conversions, as well as the establishment of more than 300 stations of work with more than 500 local helpers in all eighteen provinces. Due to health issues, Taylor remained in Switzerland, semi-retired with his wife. In 1900, Dixon Edward Hoste was appointed the Acting General Director of the CIM, and in 1902, Taylor formally resigned. His wife, Jennie, died of cancer in 1904 in Les Chevalleyres, Switzerland, and in 1905, Taylor returned to China for the eleventh and final time. There he visited Yangzhou and Zhenjiang and other cities, before dying suddenly while reading at home in Changsha. He was buried next to his first wife, Maria, in Zhenjiang, in the small English Cemetery near the Yangtze River. The small cemetery was built over with industrial buildings in the 1960s and the grave markers were destroyed. However, the marker for Hudson Taylor was stored away in a local museum for years. His great-grandson, James Hudson Taylor III, found the marker and was able to help a local Chinese church re-erect it within their building in 1999. His re-erected tombstone reads: In 2013 the land for the cemetery was re-developed and the demolition of the old industrial buildings revealed that the Taylors' tombs were still intact. On 28 August the graves were excavated with the surrounding soil and moved to a local church where they will be reburied in a memorial garden.

The Panthers, starting Matt Moore at quarterback in place of the injured Jake Delhomme, quickly took control of the game, scoring on their first four possessions (a 38-yard John Kasay field goal; a 29-yard Jonathan Stewart touchdown run; a 22-yard Muhsin Muhammad touchdown catch; and a 2-yard catch for tight end Jeff King). Meanwhile, the Giants turned the ball over 3 times in the first half, and were shut out at halftime for the second time this season. In the third quarter, Carolina picked up where they left off, as Moore connected with Carolina's Steve Smith for a 27-yard score. The Giants finally got on the board on the ensuing drive, courtesy of a 40-yard Tynes field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Giants' Smith caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Manning, but a subsequent 2-point try failed. Carolina fullback Brad Hoover's 1-yard scoring run later in the fourth sealed the game for the Panthers. The Giants left Giants Stadium the same way they had opened it 33 years earlier; with a demoralizing loss.

Recall that higher temperatures are associated with faster particles. Gas particles are held in solution by attractive interactions with the solvent molecules. If the particles are moving slowly, these attractive forces will pull back any particles that try to escape the surface of the solution and re-enter the gas phase. However, if the gas particles are moving fast enough, these interactions will not be sufficiently strong to prevent this process from occurring. As a result, more particles are able to escape, and the amount of dissolved solute is less than it would be at a lower temperature.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A primary school in Wuhan has used new desks and chairs to prevent students from getting short sight. The desks and chairs make students have the correct posture, especially when reading and writing. Each desk has an adjustable steel bar. The bar can help students keep their eyes at least 30cm from books. Zhang Jianming is headmaster of the primary school. She said the new desks and chairs were provided by an eye care centre in the city. The school carried out a survey last September. It showed that about 7 percent of its 1,093 students said they suffered from short sight. The new desks and chairs have already improved the students' posture, but both teachers and students might need more time to get used to them. Yang Lihua is head of the Wuhan Youth Eye Care Center. She said the desks and chairs were introduced to 19 schools on a trial basis. \\"During our research into short sight, we noticed that the number of students with short sight was increasing. This is because parents are teaching their children to read and write at a very early age without paying enough attention to their posture,\\" she said. Feng Junying is a doctor at Beijing Jingshan School. \\"I think the new desks and chairs in Wuhan will certainly be helpful,\\" she said. \\"But bad reading habits at school are not the only reason for short sight. Children are using mobile phones and iPads when they are very young. This can be another reason for short sight at a young age.\\" Question: Feng Junying's words mean _ .

The following elements contribute to this positivity: 1. Mention of Spielberg: Steven Spielberg is an iconic, Academy Award-winning director known for his immense contribution to the global film industry. Thus, the mention of his name in the phrase implies that the context is related to the world of film direction, which inherently denotes a certain level of quality associated with Spielberg's works. 2. \\"Direction of Spielberg\\": This statement establishes that Spielberg is the director of the project in question. His involvement suggests that the film or project would carry his unique vision, creativity, and cinematic excellence, eventually creating a sense of anticipation or excitement about the final outcome. 3. \\"Convincing impersonation\\": This section of the phrase indicates that Spielberg does an excellent job embodying the role of a director, even though he may be playing or imitating another character within the film. This line implies that Spielberg's portrayal is believable and impressive. 4. \\"Director enjoying himself immensely\\": The phrase ends with the idea that Spielberg, as the director, is having a great time working on the project. This statement is positive because it reflects that the director finds the work engaging and fulfilling, which might likely result in a high-quality finished product. Moreover, when a director enjoys the process, it often fosters a positive environment for the crew and cast, possibly leading to better performances and higher engagement levels from everyone involved. In conclusion, the phrase \\"the direction of Spielberg, who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely\\" can be considered positive due to its elements that highlight the excellence and excitement associated with Steven Spielberg as a director.

De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was \\"nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine\\". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup.

After leaving the army in January 1919, Grainger refused an offer to become conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and resumed his career as a concert pianist. He was soon performing around 120 concerts a year, generally to great critical acclaim, and in April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema, New York's Capitol Theatre. Grainger commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Aeolian. In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at Chicago Musical College, the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years.Amid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to re-score many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away, and the orchestral version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this period. He also began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible orchestration which enabled works to be performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small chamber groups up to full orchestral strength.In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York. This was his home for the remainder of his life. From the beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from delusions and nightmares, and became fearful that her illness would harm her son's career. Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been rumours that their relationship was incestuous; in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference. Trump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation. There were, however, some significant setbacks as well, including the withdrawal of Ronny Jackson as the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs and intense congressional...

What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the committee who put forward 21 demands outside the shipyard's gate on August 17? from the following article ? On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes). More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.

If I get a job offer from a company in Sweden, but I don't have an academic degree, will that be an issue when getting a work permit? I will be honest I enjoy my subject of marketing, but have no clue what I want to do in it. I do not know whether I should get a job for a couple of years then get an MBA or if I should get an MSC in a marketing specialization. What are some opinions? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"A). No. The two questions you have asked are not the same. The first question pertains to the potential difficulties of obtaining a work permit in Sweden without an academic degree, whereas the second question focuses on determining the best choice of further academic or professional pursuits in the marketing field. Let me elaborate on the two questions in detail. 1. If I get a job offer from a company in Sweden, but I don't have an academic degree, will that be an issue when getting a work permit? It is possible to get a work permit in Sweden without an academic degree, but the process may be more challenging depending on the job you are applying for. The Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) requires that you have either a job offer or a specific job title from a Swedish employer in order to apply for a work permit. Furthermore, the employer must validate that there are no suitable candidates within Sweden or the EU/EEA for the position. In some cases, having extensive relevant experience or industry-specific certification may count in your favor, but the preference is generally given to candidates with an academic degree, especially for high-skilled positions. It is important to note that work permit requirements may vary depending on the nature of the job and the employer's demands. Multiple factors, such as your field of work, expertise, salary, and the company needing your skills, can all impact your work permit application. If you have professional experience or a unique skill set in marketing, it may still be possible for you to get a work permit without an academic degree. However, having an academic degree would increase your chances of obtaining a work permit, as it demonstrates your education background and preparedness for any given role. 2. I will be honest; I enjoy my subject of marketing, but have no clue what I want to do in it. I do not know whether I should get a job for a couple of years then get an MBA or if I should get an MSc in a marketing specialization. What are some opinions? Before making a decision, it's essential to explore the differences between an MBA program and an MSc in Marketing to better understand which program could potentially benefit you more in your future career. MBA programs are designed to provide a broad understanding of various business disciplines, such as finance, human resources, operations, and marketing. The main focus of an MBA program is to develop managerial and leadership skills, with the option to specialize in specific areas, such as marketing. MBA programs typically require prior work experience and are designed for those who want to advance in their careers, transition to a new industry or a managerial role, or even start their own business. On the other hand, an MSc in Marketing is a more specialized program focused on advanced theoretical and practical marketing concepts. This program is ideal for individuals who are passionate about marketing and wish to specialize in specific disciplines within the field, such as digital marketing, marketing analytics, or brand management. If you are unsure about the specific career path you want to take within marketing, obtaining a job and gaining some work experience before pursuing a higher degree can be beneficial. Building professional experience will help you develop a better insight into the various areas of marketing and figure out which aspects you enjoy and excel in. Additionally, work experience can help you stand out when applying to a higher degree program, as it demonstrates your practical knowledge of the marketing field. Once you've gained some experience and have a clearer understanding of where you want your career to go, you can choose between an MBA and an MSc in Marketing. If your career goals lean towards general management, leadership, or starting your own business, an MBA could be a better fit. Conversely, if your aspirations involve specialized knowledge in marketing, enrolling in an MSc program may be the more suitable choice. In conclusion, it's essential to take some time to evaluate your personal interests, strengths, and career goals in order to make an informed decision about which path is the right one for you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Police say Jordan Deal, who survived the crash and is in fair condition, took a curve too fast.

The unfortunate crash happened less than a mile from the residence of John Leonard, one of the deceased passengers. Reports suggest that Jordan Deal, who miraculously survived the crash and is now in fair condition, was driving too fast and lost control while taking a curve. The fatal accident took place just three days before Thanksgiving, casting a somber shadow over the holiday for the families and friends of those involved. John Leonard's father, Jeffrey Leonard, sent emotional texts to his son immediately after learning about the crash that happened close to their home. His first message read, \\"Where are you?\\", as he desperately sought an answer for his son's safety. Upon not receiving a reply, Jeffrey Leonard grew more concerned, sending another text three minutes later, stating: \\"John answer me right now. There has been a very serious car wreck below the church...air care is here now...I want to know it isn't you.\\" His worst fears were confirmed when, after receiving no response to his texts, Jeffrey Leonard tried calling his only son, and the call was answered by a state trooper instead. The heartbreaking moment marked the end of any hope he had for his son's wellbeing and signaled the start of a difficult period of grief and mourning for the Leonard family. As the community grapples with this tragic incident, its consequences will hopefully serve as a sobering reminder of the dangers of reckless driving, especially among young, inexperienced drivers. This tragic event has left a lasting impact on not only the families of the young men involved but also on the friends, classmates, and wider community who have to come to terms with the sudden loss and the reality of the dangers on the road. The accident has highlighted the importance of driving safety education and the necessity of impressing upon young drivers the severity of the consequences that can result from disregarding safety rules and driving recklessly. Various campaigns and programs aimed at raising awareness and promoting responsible driving practices can help alleviate some of the risks associated with adolescent driving. Ultimately, the tragic fate of these young men serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adhering to safe driving practices and the potentially devastating outcome that can arise from reckless driving behavior. It is crucial that driving safety is emphasized and that efforts are made to educate young drivers about the responsibility they hold when they are behind the wheel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Answer:","completion":"The vector sum of all the torques acting on an object is called the net torque or resultant torque. Torque, represented by the Greek letter τ (tau), is the measure of the rotational force acting on an object around a specific axis or pivot point. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. The net torque is the cumulative effect of all individual torques acting on an object, taking into account their respective magnitudes and directions. Calculating the net torque involves summing up all the individual torques acting on the object. To do this, one must break down each torque vector into its components along the x, y, and z axes. The net torque can then be determined by adding up the corresponding components and constructing the resultant vector from the summed components. Mathematically, the torque τ acting at a distance r with a force F applied on the object can be expressed as: τ = r × F Here, the symbol × denotes the vector or cross product of the distance (or lever arm) vector r and the force vector F. The result of this operation is a torque vector that is perpendicular to the plane formed by the distance and force vectors. The magnitude of the torque can also be calculated using the formula: |τ| = |r| * |F| * sin(θ) where |τ| is the magnitude of the torque, |r| is the magnitude of the distance vector, |F| is the magnitude of the applied force, and θ is the angle between the distance and force vectors. To compute the net torque acting on an object, one must sum up all the individual torques: Στ_net = Σ(r × F) The net torque determines the rotational acceleration (α) of the object based on the object's moment of inertia (I) using the following equation: Στ_net = I * α According to Newton's second law of motion for rotation, the net torque acting on an object is directly proportional to the object's angular acceleration. Consequently, the net torque influences how quickly the object rotates around its designated axis, and its direction determines the rotation direction. In summary, the vector sum of all torques acting on an object, known as the net torque, has a significant impact on the rotational motion of the object. By influencing its angular acceleration and direction, the net torque is a crucial factor in understanding the dynamics of rotating systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

In week five, the Bears, looking to go 3-0 on the road for the first time since 2006, visited the 2-2 Carolina Panthers, the Bears having led the all-time series 5-3, and also having won the most recent meeting in 2012 23-22. The Bears had been plagued by inconsistency during the season, for example in the passing attack, with Jay Cutler, playing in his first away game with Chicago against Carolina, completing 67.5 percent in the two home games with four touchdowns and four interceptions while posting an 84.7 rating. On the road, he had completed 63.9 percent of passes with six touchdowns and no interceptions, along with a 106.3 rating. In two games against the Panthers, Cutler had thrown a touchdown and two picks with a 69.5 passer rating. The Bears had to protect Cutler from a Panthers defense that recorded 60 sacks in 2013, and despite missing Greg Hardy, featured defending Defensive Player of the Year Luke Kuechly and Star Lotulelei. However, Panthers' cornerback Antoine Cason was struggling during the year, having allowed three touchdowns. Additionally, the Panthers' had allowed 75 points the last two games, compared to 21 in the first two weeks, and while allowing an average 201.7 passing yards in the first three games, the team permitted the Baltimore Ravens' Joe Flacco to throw for 327 passing yards in their last game. On the ground, the Bears had an advantage against the Panthers' 27th-ranked rushing defense, which allowed 140.8 rushing yards per game, 264 rushing yards two games prior against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and a total 391 rushing yards in the last two games. The Bears also had a chance to capitalize on the Panthers' worst-ranked red zone offenses and defenses, with Chicago boasting a second- and sixth-ranked red zone offense and defense, respectively. The Panthers were the -2.5 favorite for the game's betting line. The Bears' inactives were Sherrick McManis, Ahmad Dixon, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Charles Leno, Jr., and Jeremiah Ratliff, while Matt Slauson, D.J. Williams, and Robbie Gould were the captains. After the Bears won the toss and kicked off, the Panthers punted on their drive, and on the punt return, Santonio Holmes fumbled the ball out of bounds. The Bears would also be forced to punt, and on the return, Philly Brown was tackled by Teddy Williams before receiving the ball, and while both teams were attempting to recover the ball, Brown picked up the ball and scored on the 79-yard return. On the Bears' next drive, despite reaching the Panthers' seven-yard line, Cutler's pass for Brandon Marshall went into double coverage and was intercepted by Roman Harper, who returned the pick 44 yards to the Bears' 49-yard line, but was ruled down by challenge, and as a result, the Panthers started the drive from their own eight-yard line. Three plays later, Isaiah Frey forced Kelvin Benjamin to fumble, recovering the loose ball at Carolina's 28-yard line. The Bears would score on Cutler's ten-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte; Chicago would then capitalize on another turnover during the Panthers' next drive: after Willie Young strip-sacked Cam Newton, Lamarr Houston recovered at Carolina's 18-yard line, and on the Bears' ensuing drive, Cutler scored on a ten-yard run, the first rushing touchdown for Cutler since 2011 and the first for the team in 2014. The Bears' next drive lasted into the second quarter, and ended with the Bears extending the score to 21-7 after Cutler threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The Panthers then drove to Chicago's 25-yard line, but the drive ended after Newton's pass was intercepted by a diving Lance Briggs. However, the Bears failed to take advantage of the pick, with Gould missing a 35-yard field goal. On the final drive for Carolina, Newton threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Greg Olsen to make the score at halftime 21-14. After the Bears punted on their first drive of the second half, the Panthers reached the Bears' seven-yard line, and a penalty on Kyle Fuller moved the ball to the one-yard line, where Chris Ogbonnaya scored on a one-yard run to tie the game. Gould would give the Bears the lead again via a 45-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged punts five times in the fourth quarter, and on Chicago's third possession of the quarter, Cutler's pass for Holmes was overthrown and intercepted by Thomas DeCoud, which set up a Graham Gano 44-yard field goal. On the Bears' next play, Forte was stripped by Cason, and Kawann Short recovered. Six plays later, Cam Newton threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Olsen to take the 31-24 lead. On the Bears' final drive, the offense faced 4th-and-21 from their own 34-yard line when Cutler fumbled while being sacked by Short, and Charles Johnson recovered. Carolina kneeled twice to end the game. The Bears had three turnovers in the fourth quarter, the second team to do so in 2014, after the New York Giants, while committing two turnovers in consecutive possessions during the fourth quarter. In comparison, the team had only one in the first four games. In the passing game, poor production on short passes led to Cutler's struggles on longer throws, completing only one of five passes of 15 yards or more during the game, including two interceptions; entering the game, he was ranked 31st of 33 quarterbacks in completion percentage for such throws with 24 percent. However, the Bears had managed to score multiple passing touchdowns against the Panthers, the fourth time this had happened to the Panthers in 2014; the Panthers had only two games allowed in 2013.

Both rivers are very important for the local economies. But I can use this background: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed.

This was followed in the fourth quarter by Bryant nailing a 21-yard field goal, and with RB Michael Turner getting a 39-yard TD run. How many total touchdown pass yards did Sam Bradford make?","completion":"Sam Bradford made two touchdown passes in this game: 1. A 25-yard TD pass to TE Michael Hoomanawanui. 2. A 13-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Gibson. To calculate the total touchdown pass yards, add the yards of both touchdown passes: 25 yards (first TD pass) + 13 yards (second TD pass) = 38 yards So, Sam Bradford made a total of 38 touchdown pass yards in this game."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The population was 853 at the 2010 census, an increase over the 2000 population of 750. The population was sufficient under Utah state law for Bear River to become a city near the end of 2000. Although current state law requires a minimum population of 1000 for cities, Bear River City remains a city.","completion":"Okay little buddy, let's see if this sentence is true: \\"The population increased by at least 11.\\" Here's what we know from the text: - In 2010, there were 853 people living in Bear River City. - In 2000, there were 750 people living there.

Here is a news article: Monday night's board of selectmen meeting in this pastoral Connecticut River town featured a discussion on the closing of an elementary school, the awarding of a lawn care bid and a deeply polarizing debate over the meaning of the First Amendment. The conflict was set off at a board meeting earlier this month when Democratic Selectwoman Melissa J. Schlag knelt during the Pledge of Allegiance to protest President Donald Trump's defense of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, his hardline on undocumented immigrants and other policies put forth by the Republican president. Her stance, which echoes the public dissents of NFL players, drew harsh condemnation from critics, including several Republican gubernatorial candidates, and a spirited defense from supporters. On Monday, the first board meeting after the controversy, both sides came to the Haddam Volunteer Firehouse as the minutia of small town government gave way to an impassioned display reflecting the cultural and political fault lines of the Trump era. \\"This is political speech,'' Paul White, a 49-year-old local attorney, said over jeers from some in the audience. 'Whether I agree or not it doesn't matter. She has the right … to convey a political message.\\" But Calvin Bunnel, 71, came from Meriden to express his anger at Schlag's silent protest. \\"You don't turn your back on the flag,'' he said. He wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the message, \\"If you don't like this flag, I'll help you pack your bags.\\" I did not go to Vietnam … to pick and choose who gets to be better Americans. — Bob Wallin, Haddam Bunnel served in Vietnam and, like many other veterans in the audience, views kneeling during the pledge as a sign of profound disrespect to those who served in the military. \\"I wholeheartedly respect your right to protest, to take a knee,'' said Pablo Arroyo, a 58-year-old town resident who served in the Marine Corps. \\"But if that's what you would like to do, do it on your own time. I am not here to disrespect you as you've done to my flag, my country.\\" Arroyo recalled 18 Marines in his platoon who were killed in a suicide bombing in Beruit. Looking directly at Schlag, he said: \\"What you did was urinate on all their graves.\\" But not all of the veterans in the audience took the same view. Bob Wallin, a 71-year-old town resident and a combat veteran who served in Vietnam, delivered a poignant defense of Schlag's constitutional right to peacefully protest. Editorial: Politely Kneeling Is As Respectful As Protest Gets, Haddam Selectwoman Owed An Apology » \\"I took an oath to defend the Constitution,'' Wallin said. \\"The Constitution starts with the First Amendment. She has that right. I'm not agreeing with her and I think the reason she does it is stupid. I don't care.\\" Wallin said he was exposed to Agent Orange and is suffering the effects of that exposure. As he offered up his brief comments, he grew too weak to stand and was given a chair and a bottle of water. \\"I did not go to Vietnam … to pick and choose who gets to be better Americans,'' Wallin declared. Speaking to the politicians who have denounced Schlag, he said \\"Screw you. None of you earned that right … you people make me mad.\\" Instead of expressing outrage at Schlag on social media, Wallin implored the crowd to turn its anger toward helping veterans. \\"You want to be upset right on Facebook? Well, two veterans a day commit suicide,'' he said. Before the meeting started, Schlag's critics, led by Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Herbst and Republican candidate for state treasurer Art Linares, held a rally on the town green. As Lee Greenwood's conservative anthem, \\"God Bless the U.S.A.,'' blared from speakers, a crowd of about 75 — including a few in “Make America Great Again” hats and Trump T-shirts — came together to stand for the flag. \\"It's completely disrespectful,'' said Linares, a state senator whose district includes Haddam. Linares invoke his grandfather, who was jailed for standing up to Fidel Castro before fleeing Communist Cuba. \\"This flag, our flag, represents the freedoms that make this country so great,'' he said, \\"and he would have been so disappointed and sad to see what happened at that selectmen's meeting.\\" About a quarter of a mile away, on the long road leading to the firehouse, another crowd of about 75 gathered to stand in solidarity with Schlag. Several people donned black and put tape over their mouths to symbolize what they said were attempts to silence the selectwoman. A few wore T-shirts identifying themselves as members of the Trump resistance; others were dressed in Hillary Clinton campaign swag. \\"Seeing one of our selectmen being attacked for exercising her rights, and seeing Republicans campaign off it to rile up their base, I thought it was important to be here,'' said Aubrey Bingham, 35, of Haddam. Schlag isn’t the only Connecticut River Valley elected official to take a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance. For the past year and a half, two members of the Region 17 school board — Democrat Eric Couture of Killingworth and Republican Maura Wallin of Haddam — have silently taken a knee while the pledge was recited. But for some reason, Schlag's protest set off a storm of controversy. Monday's meeting drew more than 150 people to the firehouse on a steamy July night. At the start, Schlag once again knelt as the other board members recited the pledge with hands over their hearts. \\"Did you kneel during the Obama administration?'' someone in the audience yelled at one point. At the end of the hourlong public comment period, Schlag addressed the audience and made a plea for civility. \\"I have a right to free speech,'' she said. \\"You have a right to dislike me. But please don't put words in my brain or thoughts in my brain. I mean no disrespect to any veteran.\\" As she spoke, some in the audience knelt in support while others turned their heads or their backs to her. Others walked out. “I appreciate everyone coming out because this is truly town government at its best,'' Schlag said. \\"We need to continue the conversation or hate will continue to fester. We need to rip the bandage off. We can't wrap our sins in a flag and expect it to be OK.\\" CAPTION Megan Ahern, business analyst for Nutmeg State Financial Credit Union, demonstrates the computerized check-in kiosk for driver’s license renewals to be performed in the credit union’s new Milford branch office, starting Thursday, under a contract with the state Department of Motor Vehicles.

(AP) — A town official opposed to President Donald Trump's policies took a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance at a tense meeting packed with more than 100 people, dividing community residents and furthering an intense debate over protests and the First Amendment. Haddam Selectwoman Melissa Schlag faced jeers while she kneeled during the pledge on Monday and asked residents and politicians to not add words to her \\"silent protest.\\" \\"I appreciate everyone coming out because this is truly town government at its best,\\" Schlag, a Democrat, said after the demonstration. \\"We need to continue the conversation or hate will continue to fester.\\" Haddam resident Marine Pablo Arroyo told Schlag she should protest on her own time. \\"I am not here to disrespect you as you've done to my flag, my country,\\" Arroyo said. Vietnam veteran and town resident Bob Wallin, who supported Schlag's right to protest, said no one has a right to tell her how and when to exercise free speech. Before the meeting, about 100 people organized by Republican governor's race candidate Tim Herbst and state Sen. Art Linares rallied in the town, which has about 8,000 residents, to call Schlag's protest disrespectful. A crowd of about 75 rallied in a different part of town in support of Schlag's protest. Schlag said she began kneeling during the pledge earlier this month to protest Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his hard-line stance on immigration and other policies. Trump, a Republican, has said his immigration policies and his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border are meant to keep the United States safe. Schlag said she has no plans to seek higher office. She said she has received harassment and threats over her protest and calls for her resignation. ||||| Alyssa Hurlbut / CTMirror.org The quaint town of Haddam was transformed Monday evening into the front line of a political battle over free speech as protesters packed a routine Board of Selectmen meeting to register their opinions about the selectwoman who garnered national attention by kneeling during the Pledge of Allegiance. Since quietly protesting the Trump administration during the July 16 Board of Selectman’s meeting by taking a knee during the pledge, Melissa Schlag has awakened an outcry from both residents and Republican candidates running for statewide offices. In the garage of the town’s volunteer fire station Monday night, where Schlag joined her fellow selectmen and an audience of about 100 residents, the politician knelt once again during the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance while people in the audience stared her down or yelled the words to the oath in defiance. One veteran denounced Schlag’s actions, awakening a standing ovation from the rowdy audience spilling out the doors of the room. “One day… I lost 18 of [my platoon] in a suicide bombing. What you did was urinate all over their graves,” Pablo Arroy yelled at Schlag, who sat quietly at the selectmens’ table facing the crowd. Not all veterans were critical of Schlag, however. A Vietnam War veteran nearly lost his breath, necessitating a chair and water, after delivering a passionate “screw you”-ridden speech to those criticizing Schlag. He was met by a ripple of “boo’s” and “get off the stage.” The veterans were just two of the many citizens who dedicated their Monday evening to either denounce the selectwoman and her silent protest or defend her right to kneel. Moments before the meeting, a cluster of citizens decked out in black attire lined the doors of the fire station. Armed with signs advocating the First Amendment, the group remained planted on the grass, many wearing black tape over their mouths, for nearly two hours. Advertisement Alyssa Hurlbut / CTMirror.org A few minutes down the road at the town green, a more colorful army led by state Sen. Art Linares, R-Westbrook, and Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Herbst joined in singing — indeed, bellowing — the words to God Bless America over two loud speakers blasting patriotic songs. “I knew that when the selectman took a knee, it didn’t reflect the views of the people in this town,” Linares said. “I don’t want to see others take a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance, and this was our way of putting a stop to it.” Schlag waited until the end of the public comment portion of the meeting to make a statement. “We can’t wrap our sins in a flag and expect it to be okay,” she said, as people in the crowd turned their backs as she spoke. The clashing demonstrations were just two of the events organized in response to Schlag’s actions. Following a week and a half of backlash, a group of Haddam residents coordinated a pro-flag rally last Friday, lining the streets of the town with more than 1,000 American flags. Schlag, a Democrat, said she kneeled to protest President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Her small protest before no more than two dozen residents lasted a total of about 10 seconds, but it has been echoing in state politics ever since. “What has happened is completely disrespectful,” said Linares, who is facing an Aug. 14 primary for the GOP nomination for state treasurer. Linares was the first state politician to denounce Schlag. Linares issued a July 23 press release, calling on Schlag to “immediately apologize to Haddam residents who are offended by her lack of respect.” He followed up later that same day with a Twitter video, this time escalating his criticism to a full fledged call to action, urging Schlag to step down as selectwoman. But the fall-out didn’t end there. By July 25, Herbst, who is in a 5-way primary for the GOP nomination, was denouncing Schlag and calling for her resignation from a much more visible perch — the set of FOX & Friends, a daily morning conservative news/talk program on Fox News Channel. “She needs to resign immediately. One of the things our flag stand for, it stands for our freedom. It stands for our democracy. It stands for the fundamental ideal that we can have differences of opinion. But we all stand in respect of our flag. Many people, including my 93-year-old grandfather, was a veteran, fought in defense of the very liberties that flag resembles,” Herbst said during the show. After hearing of one another’s intersecting efforts, Herbst and Linares joined forces to organize a protest denouncing Schlag outside the town hall building Monday. “As the Senator from this district, I wanted to put an end to it,” Linares said. “ I don’t want others in this town and in my district think it’s okay to take a knee.” Both the demonstrations persisted for about two hours, until Schlag entered the Fire House for the first board meeting since the July 16 event. She was joined by First Selectman Liz Milardo and Second Selectman Larry Maggi, both of whom publicly denounced her protest. In the wake of her kneeling, Schlag said she had received an outpouring of responses that range from support to threats. She called the statements of the Republican politicians “disgusting.” Advertisement “Any candidate that tells a citizen of the U.S. that they don’t have a voice should resign and doesn’t belong in our government,” she said. “Through their political motivation, they are trying to silence the people by taking away our First Amendment rights for political gain.” She added that her protest was not an act of disrespect for the flag but rather “a silent cry for our country to be better.” “The intention of my silent protest was the bring the injustices of our country to the forefront,” she said. “The loud wave of ugly attacks on our basic rights set forth under the constitution shows just how much we have to lose.” As long as Donald Trump is president of the United States, Schlag says she will continue to kneel. On Monday evening, she did just that, this time before a much more adrenalized audience. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In Haddam, a small town in Connecticut, a town official named Melissa Schlag knelt during the Pledge of Allegiance to protest President Donald Trump's policies.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Followers, whose weight fell as low as 35kg, said to have been manipulated into following eating regime A well-known guru of macrobiotic food who met Pope Francis is among the five people under investigation in Italy after police dismantled a bizarre “sect” that allegedly denied its followers contact with the outside world. Mario Pianesi, the 73-year-old founder of a group in the central Marche and Emilia-Romagna regions of Italy, and his wife, Loredana Volpi, are suspected of being the ringleaders of a network that manipulated victims into following a strictly controlled diet known as “Ma-Pi”. Authorities said Pianesi convinced followers of the diet, modelled on the teachings of the Japanese philosopher George Ohsawa, that it would provide miracle cures for their illnesses and that traditional medicine did not work. It aims to avoid foods containing toxins and is based on whole grains, vegetables and beans. Carlo Pinto, an Ancona police chief, told the Guardian that the victims were so devoted to the diet and their “teacher” that the sect managed to coerce them into giving donations and working for free in the association’s macrobiotic centres and restaurants. The diet was so destructive that the weight of one follower plunged to 35kg (77lb). “I’ve never come across a case like it in my life,” Pinto said. “These were people suffering from physical or mental illnesses. They were convinced that the diet did them good and in return they offered to help the macrobiotic food chain, working for free and effectively sacrificing their own life.” Pianesi, Volpi and three others are being investigated for alleged maltreatment, tax evasion and criminal organisation with the aim of reducing people to slavery. The inquiry began in 2013 after a young woman told police Pianesi promised her that the diet would cure her illness. Pinto said there were eight victims, whose illnesses instead worsened, but he expected more to come forward. “Pianesi would say that doctors were assassins, traditional medicine didn’t work and that only he could help,” said Pinto. Pianesi, who along with his wife attended a mass with Pope Francis in 2016 followed by a private meeting with the pontiff, was “well respected” in Italy and “dominated” the macrobiotic industry, Pinto added. Originally from Albania, Pianesi started his empire in Marche in 1980 and went on to cultivate a business that claimed to help cure illnesses including diabetes. He once claimed that 26 scientific journals had endorsed the Ma-Pi diet as a tool for the prevention and treatment of chronic illnesses. He also boasted of having collaborated with UN agencies including the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). His popularity is such that he is an honorary citizen of 12 towns in Italy and across the world. ||||| Italian police said on Wednesday they had smashed a “macrobiotic sect” run by a 73-year-old guru and businessman who allegedly reduced followers to slavery by rigidly controlling their diets and denying them contact with the outside world. Fourteen people were arrested in the Marche region of central Italy and five placed formally under investigation on suspicion of running a criminal gang tied to slavery, mistreatment and tax evasion, judicial sources said. Investigators began an inquiry in 2013 when a young girl in the town of Forli denounced to police promises by the guru that his diet could miraculously heal otherwise incurable illnesses, police said. Those under investigation included guru Mario Pianesi, 73, his wife Loredana Volpi, 51, and two other collaborators, police said. Followers allegedly were manipulated to follow a rigidly controlled five-stage diet called “Ma.Pi.,” coined after the name of their leader. The weight of one female follower was reduced to as little as 35kg (77lb), though she had no weight problems beforehand, police sources said. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A strict macrobiotic diet tends to rely heavily on whole grains such as brown rice Police in Italy say they have broken up a \\"psycho sect\\" that enslaved members by forcing them to adhere to a strict macrobiotic diet and cut off contact with the outside world.

Mario Pianesi reportedly told them that Ma.Pi. would provide miracle cures. The investigation started in 2013 after a young woman left the sect and denounced its head to police. They found that as well as having to pay for the diet and give donations, members were coerced into working long hours with next to no pay.

He is tended by a nurse, Julie Benson, and they have fallen in love. Corey's military pal, Steve Connolly, arrives in early November to discuss plans for the ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona, they plan to purchase and operate together once Corey is out of the hospital. The two men pool their G.I. benefits (totaling 40,000) to do so. Corey's final surgery is in mid-December, but Connolly does not appear at the hospital afterward to see his friend. By Christmas, Corey is still in recovery but Connolly still remains absent. One night, as Corey lies semi-conscious in bed after being administered a sleeping drug, a woman with a Swedish accent appears at his bedside. She says Connolly has been in a horrible accident; his spine is shattered and he wants to die, but she has refused to help him commit suicide. The woman asks Corey what to do, and he advises her to do nothing to harm Steve, and just to wait. Corey slips into unconsciousness, and the woman disappears. After New Year's Day, Corey is released from the hospital. He is immediately stopped by police detectives and then questioned by Captain Garcia of the Los Angeles Police, who tells him that Connolly is wanted for the murder of Solly Blayne, a local high-stakes gambler and racketeer murdered at his home in Los Feliz.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success.

Over the centuries, the living here has always been easy enough to attract a steady stream of immigrants. Bountiful food sources might have made Malaysia an inviting place for the contemporaries of Java Man — in 230,000 b.c. But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family. Other tough migrants from the South Seas settled along the coasts — sailors, fishermen, traders (for the most part pirates) — known euphemistically as orang laut (sea people).

Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by an individual gas component within a gaseous mixture when it is present among other gases.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"If people care more about climate change, it will have a \\"less\\" effect on more oil being placed in a stove. Step-by-step justification: 1. As people become more concerned about climate change, they seek to reduce their carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Since burning oil contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution, these individuals will start looking for alternative, eco-friendly heating options. 3. With more people adopting alternative heating solutions (such as solar panels, heat pumps, or electric stoves), the overall demand for oil will decrease. 4. The reduced demand for oil will lead to less oil being gathered through mining operations and transported to stores. 5. As a result, fewer homeowners will purchase oil for their stoves. 6. Ultimately, there will be less oil being placed into stoves, which in turn means that the warm air generated by burning oil will be reduced in the house. 7.

Choices: - physical - radiation - carbon - chemical A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"- Chemical When wood is burned, the energy that enables the process is chemical energy. Wood is primarily composed of organic compounds, such as cellulose and lignin, which store energy in the form of chemical bonds. When wood is exposed to heat, a process called combustion, or burning, occurs. Combustion is a chemical reaction where the organic compounds in wood react with oxygen in the air to produce heat, light, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gaseous products. During combustion, the chemical bonds in the organic compounds within wood are broken, and new bonds are formed with oxygen. The process releases the stored chemical energy as heat and light, which are forms of thermal and electromagnetic energy, respectively. Although radiation is associated with the light and heat produced during combustion, it is not the primary energy source that allows wood to burn. In summary, it is the chemical energy stored within the organic compounds in wood that enables burning to occur. This energy is transformed, released, and utilized as thermal and electromagnetic energy when combustion starts and proceeds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Who was the President of Argentina when it invaded the Falklands in 1982?","completion":"Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri was the President of Argentina when the country invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982. Galtieri served as Argentina's President from December 22, 1981, until June 18, 1982, following a long history of playing a crucial role in military and political affairs in Argentina. Galtieri was an Argentine army general and a key figure in the National Reorganization Process (Proceso de Reorganización Nacional), a military junta that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. He became the 45th president of Argentina after a coup that overthrew President Roberto Eduardo Viola. Galtieri was the third and penultimate leader within the junta during its existence. The background of the Falklands crisis involves a longstanding territorial dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and South Sandwich Islands. The dispute had persisted since the 19th century, and Galtieri's government saw the opportunity to regain control of the disputed territories. This decision was partly fueled by the idea that retaking these islands would help consolidate Galtieri's domestic power and distract from the country's political and economic crises. The Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands (known as the Islas Malvinas in Spanish) took place on April 2, 1982. The attack caught the United Kingdom by surprise, and the British government, led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, quickly launched a military expedition to reclaim the islands. The conflict, known as the Falklands War, lasted for 74 days and resulted in the deaths of 655 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders. The British forces successfully defeated the Argentine military and reclaimed the Falkland Islands in mid-June 1982. Argentina's failure in the Falklands War led to widespread civil unrest and protests against Galtieri's government. The disillusionment with military rule contributed to the eventual collapse of the junta and the return to a democratic government in Argentina in 1983. As a result of the defeat in the Falklands War and mounting pressure from the Argentine public, Galtieri was removed from the presidency on June 18, 1982. He was later arrested and imprisoned for human rights abuses committed during Argentina's \\"Dirty War,\\" a period characterized by state terrorism and forced disappearances of political dissidents.

Josh gives chase and almost catches him when he is clotheslined by FBI agent Claire Denham. Denham explains that Shaw wasn't being kidnapped, he was attempting to flee arrest, accused of running a Ponzi scheme. Josh tells the Tower staff about Shaw's arrest and explains that he gave Shaw their pension fund to invest, and their money is gone. Josh, Charlie and Enrique visit Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Josh tells Shaw that Lester attempted suicide after losing everything he had. Shaw expresses condolences but appears insincere. Josh responds by destroying the windows of a Ferrari 250 Shaw has on display in his apartment. The building's owner is furious at Josh's action and fires Josh, Charlie and Enrique.Josh meets Denham at a bar and she invites him to get drunk. As they drink she says Shaw must have had a cash safety net and suggests in jest that he find and steal it. Josh gathers Charlie, Enrique, and former Tower tenant Mr. Fitzhugh to draw up a plan to steal Shaw's money. Charlie brings up the obvious drawback that they are not thieves. Josh hires his neighbor, a petty criminal named Slide, to help. Slide trains the team but realizes he cannot do the robbery because he doesn't know how to crack the safe in Shaw's apartment.

What other companies do you admire? I love simple disruptive models — extreme examples on two ends of a spectrum would be Uber and Apple AAPL or Whole Foods WFM and Amway. What is the best advice you ever received? Always separate the institution from the personality. What would you do if you weren’t working at your current job? At Pegasus Capital, my current job is putting people and companies together with the resources, strategy, and insights to have a major impact on the health of individuals, communities, and the environment. I love what I do every day. What is your greatest achievement? Learning to be grateful for life and the opportunity to live every day. My two kids — and now two grandchildren — are by far my greatest accomplishments. What has been your biggest failure? Too many to answer here — but probably in my younger days as CEO of middle market companies [when I] was thinking that I could actually control people and outcomes. What is one goal that you would like to accomplish during your lifetime? Years ago, it was to be on the cover of Fortune. No kidding — in fact, I wrote my weekly to-do’s on a blank sheet of paper with the Fortune banner over the top saying that I would only work on things that big. Today it [will] be that my grandkids can learn something from me. What was your biggest missed opportunity? I should have married my first girlfriend, my high school sweetheart, who I am with now almost 40 years later. Two hours in the gym, three hours of phone and emails, break for a walk and lunch, one hour of meditation, two hours of phone and emails, then coffee and “what if?” thinking and notes, then switch to wine and food with friends and family.

Given the question \\"How would Robin feel afterwards?\\", is \\"excited\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Given the context, it seems Robin has been very helpful to their friends and went beyond the limits in extending help. However, without having more information about Robin's personality and preferences, it's not possible to definitively say that Robin would feel \\"excited\\" as a result of these actions. Feeling \\"excited\\" certainly could be a valid answer, as some people experience excitement and joy from being able to help others, and it might be even more exhilarating when pushing their own limits to provide assistance. However, other possible reactions could include feeling exhausted (if the help required a lot of effort), satisfied (from being able to provide support), or even overwhelmed (if going beyond their limits was too challenging). In summary, while \\"excited\\" could be a valid answer to how Robin might feel after helping their friends extensively, it is not the only possible emotion Robin could experience.

Q:The answer to the question: What government position was held by the man who was interviewed on television about the operation that did not have official acknowledgement of special forces? is inside the article: One British soldier, Bradley Tinnion, was killed in the operation. Another twelve soldiers were injured, one seriously. The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) did not officially acknowledge the involvement of special forces, issuing a press release which made no mention of the SAS, but when it was made public that Brad Tinnion was a Lance Bombardier originally from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, it became clear to experts that Tinnion had been serving with special forces. Operation Barras was Tinnion's first operational deployment as an SAS trooper.Also confirmed to have died in the operation were 25 West Side Boys, although the true figure is probably far higher. The gang's resistance was stronger than had been expected and there was speculation that more bodies lay undiscovered in the jungle. Several other West Side Boys were captured, while others fled into the jungle. Many of those who fled later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight of Operation Barras, to which Julius Spencer, Sierra Leone's Minister for Information, declared that the West Side boys were \\"finished as a military threat\\". Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme. Kallay, the gang's leader, recorded a message for broadcast on Sierra Leonean radio urging the remaining West Side Boys to surrender to UNAMSIL. He also identified the bodies of West Side Boys killed in Magbeni and Gberi Bana, which were subsequently buried in a mass grave.The morning of the operation, General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of the British Armed Forces—was coincidentally due to appear on Breakfast with Frost, a Sunday morning political television programme hosted by Sir David Frost.

A plunger with a simple rubber cup attached to a wooden handle is the best tool for the job. If you have a flange plunger with an extra ring of rubber around the bottom, fold the extra ring into the cup. The plunger will bring up whatever is clogging the drain. Don't use a plunger if you've poured toxic chemicals like bleach down the drain, as it will bring these up, too. They can splash and cause burns. If you have an overflow drain in your tub, this can break the suction created with a plunger. Make sure it is completely closed off by covering it with a wet towel. The outside of the drain may be wet from a recent shower. If it is not evenly wet, pour some water into the tub. Or, use a small amount of petroleum jelly around the edge of the cup of the plunger to get a better seal. If there is a lot of standing water in your tub, remove some of it with a bucket before you start to plunge. This will keep it from splashing you. The cup will seal when you start to pump. Move the handle up and down a few times to force air out. Then push vigorously for about 20 seconds. Don't push so hard that you break the seal. If the plunging worked, it will have brought up whatever was clogging your drain. Remove the clog with your hands or use a wire snake if you can't reach it. Use a flashlight to get a good look. To check that everything has been cleared out, turn on the water and watch to see if it drains. If the water doesn't drain, try using a hand snake or baking soda and vinegar solution.

Barra McGrory also promised RHI witness evidence will not be used in deciding whether to take such a criminal case. Chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin asked for this, to ensure witnesses could not use legal protections on self-incrimination to frustrate the inquiry's work. The public inquiry was set up in January to investigate the operation of a botched green energy scheme. The aim of the RHI initiative was to encourage businesses and other non-domestic users to move from using fossil fuels towards renewable heating systems. However, a lack of cost controls and overly generous payments led to a financial scandal which brought down Northern Ireland's power-sharing government. News of Mr McGrory's witness evidence guarantee came as the RHI inquiry held its second public session. The commitment covers witness statements, oral evidence and any document produced solely by that person to the inquiry. However, it does not cover anyone who gives false testimony. Sir Patrick said his intention now was to begin hearing oral evidence in the first two weeks of October. The chairman also outlined the huge task facing the inquiry. To date, his team has processed 320,000 pages of documents - the equivalent of approximately 1,000 lever arch files - much of it relating to email chains. Sir Patrick said statements from some witnesses ran to more than 100 pages. He added that was an indication of \\"just how seriously many of those involved are treating their engagements with the inquiry\\". Sir Patrick was unable to provide an estimate of the total number of as yet unprocessed documents received by his team, but said it was the equivalent of 13 gigabytes of computer memory. The chairman has issued 320 summons to individuals and organisations asking them to produce evidence. Some have received more than one. These include government departments, politicians, civil servants and special advisors. In addition, 1,058 recipients of RHI subsidy have been written to, asking for co-operation in respect of relevant information. About 80 of them have replied. Sir Patrick said the information his team received from the claimants had opened up further lines of investigation. The retired Appeal Court judge was appointed to chair the public inquiry in January, by Northern Ireland Executive ministers before the collapse of the assembly. The financial controversy - dubbed the \\"cash-for-ash scandal\\" - engulfed Stormont late last year. DUP leader Arlene Foster set up the RHI scheme in 2012, in her then role as Stormont's enterprise minister. However, flaws in the design of the scheme led to accusations that the more fuel claimants burned, the more cash they earned. A whistleblower claimed the subsidy scheme was being abused, with claims that one farmer aimed to collect about £1m over 20 years for heating an empty shed - fuelling \\"money-to-burn\\" claims. It was never proven. Earlier this year, it was projected that more than £1bn of public money was to due to be paid out by the UK government over the next 20 years - with £490m coming from Stormont's block grant. Cost controls have since been introduced for 2017/18 which will greatly reduce that amount, but RHI recipients who will lose out are set to challenge cost-cutting measure in the courts later this year. Under mounting public pressure in January, the late Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister of Northern Ireland in protest at the DUP's handling of the investigation. His party had demanded that Mrs Foster step aside temporarily as first minister to allow an inquiry to begin, and when she refused, he quit. The joint nature of their office meant that when he resigned his post, she also lost her job, and the secretary of state had to call a snap assembly election in March. Sir Patrick is leading a three-person panel which has promised to conduct a thorough investigation into the design and operation of the RHI scheme, including efforts to implement cost controls. At the time of his appointment, the chairman said: \\"Rest assured every stone will be turned and there will be no dark corners where the light won't shine.\\" The other panel members assisting him are Dame Una O'Brien, a former Permanent Secretary of the UK Department of Health, and Keith MacLean, chair of the energy UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC).

The inquiry, which has led to the collapse of the country’s power-sharing government, will examine the operation of the initiative, which was designed to encourage businesses to use renewable heating systems.

He led the Baltimore Colts to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959 and the New York Jets to victory in Super Bowl III in 1969. He is the only coach to win a championship in both the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL). Ewbank moved back to Oxford in retirement and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent. Ewbank's coaching style was laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. \\"Weeb combined a low-key style with a flair for the most dramatic of accomplishments\\", former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 1998. \\"He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred to stay in the background and let the players take the credit.\\" He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown \\"had the exact same approach: Don't do too much, but what you do, execute it flawlessly\\", Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts' 1958 championship team had only six passing plays. Ewbank is the only man to coach two professional football teams to championships, and the only man to win the NFL championship, the AFL championship and a Super Bowl. Ewbank's regular-season career record in the NFL and AFL was 130-129-7, and his playoff record was 4-1. Ewbank was selected as the head coach on the AFL All-Time Team in 1970. In addition to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1969, the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Talawanda School District Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. He also won the Walter Camp Distinguished American Award in 1987 and was inducted into the Jets' Ring of Honor in 2010. Ewbank suffered a dislocated hip in the aftermath of the Jets' 1968 AFL championship game win, and had other health issues in his later years. He broke his leg and had two hip replacements in the 1990s. He also had myasthenia in his right eye. Ewbank died at 91 on November 17, 1998, the 30th anniversary of the \\"Heidi Game\\", after suffering from heart problems. He and his wife Lucy had three daughters.

The Raiders struggled from the outset, allowing the Cowboys to drive inside Raider territory before Sean Smith intercepted a Dak Prescott pass to end the drive. Following a punt by the Raiders, the Cowboys moved right down the field, but were stopped at the Oakland 27 yard line. Settling for a 45-yard field goal, the Cowboys took the lead. The Raiders failed to manage a first down again on their second possession, the Cowboys took over and moved down field again. This time, the Raider defense could not stop the Cowboys and Rod Smith scored on a one-yard run to increase the Cowboy lead to 10-0. The Raider offense did manage two first downs on their next possession, but again were forced to punt. After forcing a Cowboy punt, the Raiders took over with just over three minutes left in the half. The offense came alive as the Raiders moved down to the Cowboy 11 yard line. Derek Carr then hit Jared Cook for an 11 yard touchdown, but Cook was called for pass interference on the play and the touchdown was taken off the board. The Raiders drive stalled and, with three seconds remaining, Giorgio Tavecchio missed a 39-yard field goal as the half expired leaving the score at 10-0. On the opening kickoff of the second half, Cordarrelle Patterson returned the kick 100 yards for a touchdown. However, the return was nullified on a Raider holding call. However, the Raider offense would make up for the mistake as they took the ball 90 yards and Carr found Michael Crabtree on a two-yard pass to narrow the lead to 10-7. On the ensuing Cowboy possession, Sean Smith intercepted Dak Prescott for the second time in the game and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown and Raider lead. Upon review of the play, it was determined that Smith was down by contact at the 22. The Raider offense failed to capitalize on the turnover, only managing one yard and settling for a Tavecchio 39-yard field goal to tie the game at 10. The Raider defense continued its strong play to start the second half by stopping the Cowboys on three plays on the next possession. However, punter Chris Jones took the snap and rushed around the right side of the line for a 24-yard gain and a first down. Nine plays later, Prescott scrambled in from five yards out to retake the lead 17-10. As the fourth quarter began, the Raiders answered as Carr again hit Crabtree from two yards out to cap a 53-yard drive to tie the game at 17. Following punts by both teams, the Cowboys moved to the Raider five-yard line as the two minute warning sounded. However, the Raider defense stiffened and the Cowboys could not get the ball in the end zone. Dan Bailey hit a 19-yard field goal with 1:47 remaining to give the Cowboys a 20-17 lead. Needing a field goal to tie, the Raiders drive stalled at their own 30 yard line with just over one minute remaining. On fourth down, Carr rolled out of the pocket and heaved the ball downfield to Crabtree who could not make the catch. But, the Cowboys were called for pass interference on the play and the Raiders took over on the Dallas 15, well within field goal range. Two plays later, Carr scrambled to the goal line and would have had a first down, but instead attempted to dive to the pylon to score the winning touchdown. Carr, however, lost control of the ball attempting to reach it into the end zone and fumbled it out of the end zone giving the ball to the Cowboys on a touchback. The Cowboys were able to a knee to end the game and secure the 20-17 win. The loss moved the Raiders to 6-8 on the season and eliminated them from the AFC West race. Carr threw for only 171 yards in the game as the offense, as usual, struggled through most of the game. The Raiders committed 14 penalties for 105 yards in the game as their disastrous season all but came to an end. Question: How many field goal kicks were missed during the game?

The music makes us constantly aware of the sea's immensity, it's potential for threat, and the play of light on its waves. But the sea isn't just a special background, it weighs on the lives of the characters, offering them a living, but at a price. In the first act the laboured sound of the strings evokes the complete heaviness of the sailor's work, as they haul the boats up the shingle . Then a storm gathers which rages through the scene at the Inn, and stirs up an orchestral hurricane. Even when it's calm and favorable, the sea is inescapable. In the comfortable enclosed world of the opera house, this can only be suggested. In the production of Peter Grimes about to open at the Aldeburgh Festival, it will be really present, because the opera is taking place on the beach, the setting for much of the narrative of Britten's opera, and also the poem by the Suffolk poet George Crabbe that inspired it. This won't be the first opera production to be set in the actual landscape in which the action takes place. There's a well-known filmed production of Tosca shot in Castel Gandolfo in Rome, and a production of Donizetti's Anna Bolena was once mounted in the moat surrounding the Tower of London. But those were manageable urban landscapes, with comfortingly solid buildings to act as wind shields and acoustic blocks. On the Aldeburgh beach there's actually nothing, apart from a few boats, some whole, some wrecked. Here anything more complicated than walking the dog is hard to solve. The wind blows away one's words, so conversation is hard, and anything not tied down tends to blow away. The sliding shingle turns one's steps into a drunken stagger. The idea of performing an opera in these conditions seems quite _ -- an accusation Aldeburgh director Jonathan Reakie takes cheerfully on the chin. Why has he done it? \\"Well, Grimes is the opera of Britten's that's most associated with Aldeburgh, but it's never been produced at the Festival which he founded....

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days. Question: \\"How do you calculate the height of a wave?\\" Answer: \\"The vertical distance between the highest point and the lowest point of the wave\\" Is this answer correct? OPT: a. no b. yes...I think the answer is","completion":"b. yes, the answer is correct. The height of a wave, also known as the amplitude, can be calculated by determining the vertical distance between the highest point (crest) and the lowest point (trough) of the wave. In order to calculate this, you need to have measurements of the crest and trough positions. Once you obtain these measurements, you can simply subtract the position of the trough from the position of the crest to determine the height or amplitude of the wave. Additionally, it is important to note that several factors influence the size of ocean waves, such as the speed, duration, and distance over which the wind blows. Stronger winds over long distances and for extended periods tend to generate larger waves. Extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, can also lead to the creation of significantly larger waves due to the intense and sustained wind speeds of more than 150 miles per hour. In summary, to calculate the height of a wave, you need to measure the vertical distance between its highest point (the crest) and its lowest point (the trough). The answer provided earlier is correct, as the height of a wave is determined by this vertical distance, which is influenced by various factors such as wind speed, distance, and duration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Euclid v. Amble was a case","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"Euclid v. Amble was a case\\" is true, as it refers to the landmark United States Supreme Court case Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926), commonly known as Euclid v. Ambler. This case played a pivotal role in the development and recognition of zoning laws and ordinances in the United States and influenced the implementation of zoning practices in other countries like Canada. The case arose when the Ambler Realty Company sued the Village of Euclid, Ohio, after the village enacted a zoning ordinance that effectively reduced the value of Ambler Realty's property. The ordinance divided the village into six different zoning districts and restricted the use of land and construction within each district. Ambler Realty argued that this ordinance violated the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment by depriving it of property without due process of the law and constituting an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of governmental authority. The Supreme Court's ruling in Euclid v. Ambler came as a surprise to many because the lower courts had ruled in favor of Ambler Realty, striking down the zoning ordinance. However, the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld the zoning ordinance as a constitutional exercise of the Village of Euclid's police power. The Court recognized that municipal governments need the power to regulate land use for the public welfare and that zoning ordinances like the one in question were necessary to control the growth of urban areas and protect public health, safety, and general welfare. Justice George Sutherland, writing for the majority, acknowledged that while zoning may sometimes diminish property values, this effect was not enough to invalidate zoning ordinances that seek to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of a community. The Court argued that the public interest in maintaining a well-ordered community outweighed any individual property rights that may be negatively impacted by zoning regulations. The Euclid v. Ambler decision established the constitutionality of zoning as a legitimate practice for regulating land use in the United States and laid the groundwork for future zoning cases. Since this landmark ruling, zoning ordinances have been enacted in cities and towns across the country and have had a significant impact on urban planning, development, and the overall shaping of American landscapes. The case's influence also extends beyond the United States, as other countries have adopted zoning practices based on the principles established in this historic decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Answer the following question: Information: - Virarajendra Chola (10631070 CE) was one of the most underrated Chola kings, mainly because a major part of his life was spent as a subordinate of his two elder brothers Rajadhiraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola II, who along with Virarajendra Chola himself were the illustrious sons of their Chakravarti(Emperor) father, Rajendra Chola I. While certainly it was not a practice among the Chola kings to nominate the eldest son, but the most capable (in administration of their domains as well as proving their mettle on the battlefield) as the heir to the throne. During his early reign he granted the maintenance of a school to study the Vedas, Sastras and Grammar and a hostel was provided for the students. A hospital named Virasolan was also provided by him for the sick people. The famous grammatical work in Tamil, Virasoliyam was written by Buddhamitra during his reign. - Rajendra Chola II reigned as the Chola king succeeding his elder brother Rajadhiraja Chola in the 11th century. He is best remembered for his role in the battle of Koppam along with his elder brother where he dramatically turned the tables on the Chalukyan King Someshvara I, after the death of his brother in 1052. During his early reign an expedition was led to Sri Lanka, in the course of which the Sri Lanka army was routed and their king Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa was driven to take refuge in a mountain-fortress. He maintained the Chola Empire well as the distribution of his records show that the Chola Empire did not suffer any loss of territory during his reign. - Rajendra Chola I or Rajendra I was a Chola emperor who is considered one of the greatest rulers and military generals of India. He succeeded his father Rajaraja Chola I in 1014 CE. During his reign, he extended the influence of the Chola empire to the banks of the river Ganga in North India and across the Indian ocean to the West, making the Chola Empire one of the most powerful empires of India. Rajendras conquests included the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and he successfully invaded and raided the territories of Srivijaya in Malaysia, Southern Thailand and Indonesia in South East Asia. The Cholas exacted tribute from Thailand and the Khmer kingdom of Cambodia. He defeated Mahipala, the Pala king of Bengal and Bihar, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital city called Gangaikonda Cholapuram. - Kpparaksarivarman Rjdhiraja Chla I was an 11th-century emperor of the Indian Chola empire and the successor of his father, Rajendra Chola I. During his long reign, he helped his father conquer many territories and maintained the Chola authority over most of Lanka, Vengi, Kalinga, etc. and the relations with overseas domains despite a series of revolts in the territory. Rajadhiraja Cholas record shows that he was a born fighter who was very capable of maintaining a vast and expansive empire with territories even outside the shores of India. He was a great warrior who always led from the front. His life is a testimony to a king who fought his own wars standing shoulder to shoulder with his men on front lines. He performed the horse sacrifice and earned the title \\"Jayamkonda Cholan\\" (The Victorious Cholan). He was also known as \\"Vijaya Rajendra Cholan\\" (the victorious Rajendra Cholan). One of his predecessors, Rajaraja Chola I also assumed the title Jayangonda Chola towards the \\"end\\" of his reign. - Athirajendra Chola ( 1070 CE ) reigned for a very short period of few months as the Chola king succeeding his father Virarajendra Chola . His reign was marked by civil unrest , possibly religious in nature , in which he was killed . The Chalukya Chola prince Rajiga succeeded him as Kulothunga Chola I.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Chasing Dreams Genre: Comedy-Drama Plot Summary: Chasing Dreams tells the heartwarming, emotional, and hilariously awkward story of Jim Branson, a Broadway dreamer who tries to chase his passion for theatre and stage with the help of his childhood friend, Sara Adams. When Sara moves to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Jim must navigate life without her support and ultimately learn what it takes to pursue his passions, no matter where the journey takes him. Plot: Jim Branson (30s, aspiring Broadway actor) is living in the heart of New York City – the perfect place to pursue his dream of performing on the grand stage. He auditions day after day, facing the all-too-familiar image of being rejected and forced to pick up his pride and try again. Despite the constant setbacks, Jim remains hopeful and presses on, thanks in part to his ever-supportive and lively childhood friend, Sara Adams (30s, graphic designer). Sara is an incredibly talented graphic designer, brimming with dreams of her own but, she is bound by the responsibilities of looking after her sick mother. Though the two friends come from different backgrounds, they share many similarities; a love for arts, their relentless support for one another, and their inner strength to keep chasing their dreams. They often spend their nights together visiting Broadway shows and dreaming of the day Jim will see his name in the marquee. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Sara receives a job offer from a prestigious graphic design firm located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She is torn between staying in New York City with her mother and Jim or grabbing this life-changing opportunity. After weighing the pros and cons, with a heavy heart, she chooses to accept the offer and move to Milwaukee, believing it could substantially support her mother's medical expenses. This sudden change leaves Jim emotionally distraught, as he has never faced his audition rejections and the competitive circus that is Broadway without Sara by his side. Nonetheless, Sara insists that he keep chasing his dreams, even from afar. In Milwaukee, Sara settles into her new job while Jim continues to face his struggles alone. One day, he hatches an idea to create a show of his own: a small-scale passion project set to tour community theatres and local arts festivals. He channels his feelings of life without Sara into the production, creating a heartfelt story revolving around the power of friendship and dreams. He enlists the help of fellow aspiring performers, all equals in their hunt for their big break in New York City. As the show slowly gains popularity, Sara learns about Jim's success through social media. Missing her friend terribly and seeing the passion in his work, she decides to come back to the city for a short visit, surprising Jim on opening night of their show's off-Broadway debut. At the end of the show, they reunite with tears and laughter, sharing their stories that have unfolded since their separation. As the night draws to an end, Sara presents Jim with an offer to collaborate: she will handle the graphic design aspects for his shows while Jim continues to create the on-stage magic. Despite the distance between them, they vow to remain each other's biggest cheerleaders and to help one another chase their dreams – together or apart. The movie concludes with a snapshot of the two friends filled with hope and determination, working together, even from a distance, to make the world a more vibrant and colorful place, one dream at a time. Chasing Dreams is a heartwarming tale reflecting the very essence of the human spirit and the value of friendship, dreams, and determination to keep pursuing what you love, no matter where life takes you. Its delightful mix of humorous dialogue and touching emotional scenes brings life to a story that stays with the audience long after the credits roll."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As I write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake culture. Movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'King Kong, 'The Wicker Man' and practically every film that ever starred Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as 'Dough for the Do-Do' proves. An entirely pointless colorized version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Dough for the Do-Do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over Clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by Friz Freleng. Freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with Clampett's source material, although in truth no director could hope to come close to Clampett's inspired insanity. Inevitably, then, 'Dough for the Do-Do' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached.

What does it feel like to be a mother who has Asperger's Syndrome and has a child or children who do not have Asperger's Syndrome? What does it feel like to be a father with Asperger's Syndrome who has a child or children who also have Asperger's Syndrome? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Being a mother with Asperger's Syndrome who has a child or children without the condition can be a unique experience, filled with both challenges and opportunities for growth. Asperger's Syndrome, a type of autism spectrum disorder, is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and understanding social cues, as well as a tendency towards repetitive behaviors and focused interests. Mothers with Asperger's Syndrome might face some challenges in parenting, such as: 1. Difficulty in understanding their child's emotional or social needs due to their own difficulty in interpreting social cues. This might lead to feelings of confusion, frustration, and even guilt for not being able to \\"connect\\" with their child in the way they would like to. 2. Struggling with the change and unpredictability that comes with raising children. Those with Asperger's Syndrome often prefer routine and predictability, which can be disrupted by the natural chaos of family life. 3. Social isolation, as forming friendships with other parents or participating in social events might be difficult due to the mother's social challenges. 4. Potential fatigue and overwhelm, as sensory sensitivities and challenges in emotional regulation can make parenting even more demanding for those with Asperger's Syndrome. On the other hand, there can also be positive aspects when a mother with Asperger's Syndrome raises a neurotypical child: 1. Developing a unique understanding of diverse neurology and championing acceptance and understanding of neurodiversity. 2. A heightened level of empathy, as the mother is likely to be more sensitive to her child's feelings and needs, especially if she has faced similar challenges in her own life. 3. An opportunity for growth and increased self-awareness as the mother learns to navigate her own Asperger's Syndrome while parenting. In the case of a father with Asperger's Syndrome who has a child or children who also have the condition, the experience may have similarities and differences when compared to the previous scenario. Some of the challenges that these fathers may face include: 1. Difficulty in understanding or providing adequate emotional support, as fathers with Asperger's Syndrome might struggle with emotional expression and communication. 2. Accepting and accommodating the different behaviors, needs, and routines of each family member, particularly if other family members have differing levels of support needs or co-existing conditions. 3. Struggling to model or teach social skills, as fathers with Asperger's might have difficulty with social interactions themselves. However, there may also be several positive aspects to this situation: 1. A shared understanding and empathy between the father and child based on their similar experiences living with Asperger's Syndrome. 2. The opportunity for the father to provide support, guidance, and strategies for coping with Asperger's, based on his own experiences and insights. 3. The development of strong bonds and unique connections between father and child, based on their shared interests and perspectives. In conclusion, while there may be similarities between the two scenarios, such as experiencing difficulties in social interactions and the challenge of reacting to unpredictable situations, they are not the same. A mother who has Asperger's and raises neurotypical children might struggle to fully understand her child's social and emotional needs, while a father with Asperger's raising a child who also has the condition may benefit from their shared experiences. Both situations have their unique challenges and triumphs, but the differences lie in the dynamics that the presence or absence of Asperger's in the children creates in the parent-child relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said,\\"You may go to prison,or you may go to Camp Green Lake.\\"Stanley was from a poor family. He had never been to camp before. So, Stanley Yelnats seems set to serve an easy sentence,which is only fair because he is as innocent as you or me. But Stanley is not going where he thinks he is. Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere. It is a place that has no lake and nothing green. Nor is it a camp,at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime. It is only a desert wasteland,dotted with countless holes dug by the boys who live at the camp. At Camp Green Lake,the warden makes the boys\\" build character\\" by spending all day, every day, digging holes:five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is searching for something,and before long Stanley begins his own search--for the truth. Fate is to find a solution to it all--the family curse,the mystery of the holes. The great wheel of justice has ground slowly for generations,but now it is about to reveal its verdict . Question: In which section of a newspaper does this passage probably appear? Options: A: Law. B: Geography. C: News. D: Literature. A:","completion":"D: Literature. Step 1: Read and understand the context of the article. The article is discussing a story about a character named Stanley Yelnats and his experiences at Camp Green Lake, a mysterious place where boys are made to dig holes as a punishment. It also mentions a family curse and a search for the truth. Step 2: Analyze the options provided. A: Law - The article is not focused on legal matters or court cases. Although there is a mention of a judge and a sentence, the main focus is not on the legal system. B: Geography - The article does not focus on geographic information or the study of the earth. Camp Green Lake's setting is mentioned, but it is part of a fictitious story. C: News - While news articles can discuss various topics, the focus of this article is not about current events or news updates. It is about a character and a story. D: Literature - The article is discussing a narrative with a plot, characters, and a mystery. It is most likely discussing a work of fiction (a book or story) which falls under the category of literature. Step 3: Choose the most accurate answer based on the context. Option D: Literature is the most appropriate section for this passage to appear in, as the article revolves around a storyline, characters, and a fictional setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Futurama: Bender's Game Context: Ignoring Professor Farnsworth's orders to conserve fuel due to a rise in dark matter prices, Leela borrows the Planet Express ship to enter a demolition derby after being insulted by rednecks. They win it, however the ship is wrecked, but due to botched laser eye surgery, the Professor only notices that the fuel has been used. As punishment, Leela is fitted with a shock collar to teach her anger management. Meanwhile, Bender finds Cubert and Dwight playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons with their friends, but he cannot join in since, as a robot, he has no imagination. After several tries at imagining things, Bender manages to imagine himself as a medieval knight named \\"Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood\\" and enters the game. Unfortunately, he soon gets lost in his fantasy and goes on a rampage, resulting in his commitment to the Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots. The crew learns that Mom, who controls the world's only Dark Matter mine, is restricting the supply in order to drive up profits. The Professor reveals to the crew that while working for her many years ago, he stumbled on a way to turn dark matter from a useless curiosity into starship fuel. The process created two energy crystals, with Mom keeping one for herself and Farnsworth hiding the other, \\"anti-backwards\\" crystal. If the two crystals are brought together, they will render all dark matter useless. Farnsworth has forgotten where he hid his crystal, but it is being used as a 12-sided die in the kids' D&amp;D game. Mom determines its location and sends her sons Walt, Larry and Igner to retrieve it, by saying that they are owl exterminators, but Farnsworth foils their attempt by sending an angry owl at them, messing up their plan since they do not know how to exterminate owls.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the movie Futurama: Bender's Game, the crucial element to destroying the dice is not explicitly stated. However, the two energy crystals, which are generated from the process of turning dark matter into starship fuel, are the key items in this context. In the movie, one crystal is kept by Mom, and the other, \\"anti-backwards\\" crystal is hidden by Professor Farnsworth, which is then being used as a 12-sided die in the kids' Dungeons & Dragons game. To destroy the dice or render dark matter useless, both energy crystals need to be brought together. When these two crystals are combined, they will neutralize all dark matter, thus making the dice insignificant in this context. The main objective of the characters in Futurama: Bender's Game is not necessarily to destroy the dice, but rather to neutralize the dark matter that powers the starships. The dice itself plays a critical role as it contains the \\"anti-backwards\\" crystal needed for the process. By bringing the energy crystals together at Mom's mine, Farnsworth, Fry, and Leela aim to neutralize the dark matter and ultimately eliminate Mom's control of the dark matter supply monopoly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam descended into deadly violence last week. The unrest was provoked by Chinese oil drilling in disputed waters. Vietnamese authorities have arrested hundreds and are calling for protests to stop. Article:","completion":"Title: China Evacuates 3,000 Citizens from Vietnam Amid Anti-Chinese Protests and Disputed Oil Drilling China has recently evacuated over 3,000 of its citizens from Vietnam, according to Xinhua news agency, following a surge of anti-Chinese protests that erupted into deadly violence last week. This string of events began as a result of China's controversial oil drilling activities in disputed waters, which has sparked tensions between the two neighboring countries. The dispute over the South China Sea, where China has been deploying oil rigs, has long been a source of tension between Beijing and Hanoi. This conflict has escalated more recently with Chinese companies embarking on oil exploration projects in contentious areas, often within what Vietnam considers its exclusive economic zone. In response, groups of Vietnamese citizens took to the streets to protest China's oil drilling activities. However, the protests soon devolved into rampant violence, resulting in the destruction of property and loss of life. Numerous Chinese-owned factories were targeted throughout Vietnam, causing significant damage and forcing thousands of Chinese nationals to flee the country for their safety. In an effort to reduce violence and restore order, Vietnamese authorities have arrested hundreds of individuals and are publicly urging demonstrators to cease their protests. Still, the underlying tensions between China and Vietnam concerning the disputed territory and natural resources remain unresolved, with the potential to cause future unrest. The recent anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam highlight an ongoing struggle for power in the South China Sea. Various nations in the region, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei, have overlapping territorial claims with China, and tensions have been growing steadily in recent years. Coordinated actions by multiple Southeast Asian governments can be seen as a response to China's increasingly assertive territorial claims in the area. China's government and state-run media have criticized the actions of the Vietnamese protesters, describing them as \\"unjustified\\" and stating that Chinese companies are operating legitimately within the disputed waters. Furthermore, Chinese officials have reiterated their determination to protect their nation's interests in the South China Sea, emphasizing that they will not be deterred by protests or hostile actions from neighboring countries. Although Vietnam's government has taken steps to arrest protesters and call for an end to the violence, there remains a persistent undercurrent of discontent and resentment among Vietnamese citizens toward China's perceived infringement on their rights. As these tensions remain unresolved, there is a real danger that further demonstrations may erupt in the future, potentially putting more lives and property at risk. While both governments are seeking to address the immediate violence and restore calm, finding a long-term solution to the complex territorial disputes that underpin this current crisis will require concerted diplomatic efforts, mutual understanding, and compromise between both parties. The international community will undoubtedly be watching with interest as these tensions continue to unfold, as stability in the South China Sea is crucial not just for the directly involved parties, but also for regional and global security. In conclusion, the evacuation of more than 3,000 Chinese citizens from Vietnam comes at a critical juncture for both countries, as they grapple with rising tensions and the consequences of deadly violence caused by deep-rooted territorial disputes. While the immediate focus for both governments will be on restoring order and ensuring the safety of their citizens, a longer-term solution to these protracted conflicts will be essential to guarantee regional stability and preserve global security."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. We think if Bill left. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"The sentence \\"We think if Bill left\\" does pose some challenges in terms of linguistic integrity. Linguistic integrity broadly refers to the extent to which a sentence adheres to the rules of syntax, semantics and pragmatics in a particular language. We'll consider each of these areas in the above sentence. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the way words are arranged and combined to form phrases and sentences. From a purely syntactic point of view, \\"We think if Bill left\\" is problematic. The verb \\"think\\" requires an object or a complement to complete its meaning, and the complement usually takes the form of a noun phrase, a verb phrase, or a clause. However, in this sentence, \\"if Bill left\\" is a conditional clause which typically should be accompanied by a main clause to form a complete conditional sentence. There is no main clause associated with the conditional clause \\"if Bill left\\", which creates syntactic ambiguity. 2. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meanings of words, phrases, and sentences. Semantically, the sentence is also ambiguous. It's not clear what the speaker believes or thinks about Bill leaving. The \\"if\\" implies a condition or a hypothesis, but without a main clause it is not clear what the outcome or consequence is. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is about how context influences the interpretation of meaning. Without further context, it's hard to determine what the intended meaning of the sentence is. Is it a concern? A prediction? Are there missing words that would provide more explanation? Here are a few ways to clear up the ambiguity and maintain the linguistic integrity of the sentence: \\"We think (it will be a great loss) if Bill left.\\" \\"We think (that things will change) if Bill left.\\" \\"We think (he should reconsider) if Bill left.\\" In each of these revisions, the verb \\"think\\" is followed by a clause that makes clear what the speakers believe or think about the hypothetical situation of Bill leaving. In conclusion, the sentence \\"We think if Bill left\\" challenges linguistic integrity at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels. Offering a main clause that serves as the outcome or consequence of Bill leaving can resolve this issue, but without that additional information, the sentence remains ambiguous and lacks clarity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I so wanted to go to the Hyderabad Music Day, but thanks to uninvited guests","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a combination of disappointment, frustration, and resignation. Firstly, there is an evident sense of disappointment, as the person tweeting genuinely wanted to attend the Hyderabad Music Day event. The use of the phrase \\"I so wanted\\" indicates a strong desire and genuine interest in the event, suggesting that it was an opportunity they were looking forward to attending and potentially enjoying themselves at. Secondly, the mention of \\"uninvited guests\\" alludes to an unexpected disruption in their plans. These guests could potentially be people that the tweet author did not plan on having over or interacting with, thus hindering their ability to attend the event. This introduction of an unforeseen factor contributes to a sense of frustration, as it implies the person tweeting had no control over the situation and was ultimately forced to miss the event due to external circumstances. Lastly, the tone of resignation could be inferred from the tweet as well. The use of the phrase \\"thanks to,\\" followed by \\"uninvited guests,\\" carries a sarcastic undertone. It highlights that the tweeting individual accepts their current circumstance, even if it is unfavorable or inconvenient. They seem to acknowledge the reality and recognize that the inability to go to Hyderabad Music Day was ultimately out of their control. This demonstration of acceptance, albeit begrudgingly, further contributes to the overall sentiment of resignation in the tweet. In conclusion, the sentiment expressed in the tweet can be characterized as a blend of disappointment, frustration, and resignation. The tweet author displayed a keen interest in attending the Hyderabad Music Day event, which was thwarted by unexpected guests, thereby inciting a sense of frustration. This ultimately leads to the individual grudgingly accepting their reality, demonstrating a feeling of resignation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars.

Plants also detect the daily cycle of light and darkness. Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees. It allows them to survive the cold and dry winter. Plants only want to grow when conditions are right.

But when bad weather gives you trouble, can you still make it before the bell rings? In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's an idea: Ask you parents to help you plant some trees this spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them from cutting.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose work was dismissed by some critics? ? Nixon in China is an opera in three acts by John Adams, with a libretto by Alice Goodman. Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip. To create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action. Following the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company. Recent critical opinion has tended to recognize the work as a significant and lasting contribution to American opera.

Question 1: What is relation between linear velocity and angular velocity? Question 2: What is the relation between linear and angular displacement? Choices: 1. no. 2. yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's analyze each question first: Question 1: What is the relation between linear velocity and angular velocity? Linear velocity refers to the velocity of an object moving in a straight line, while angular velocity refers to how quickly an object rotates. The relation between linear velocity (v) and angular velocity (ω) for a rotating object can be represented by the formula: v = r * ω where r is the radius of the circle formed by the path of the object in motion and ω is the angular velocity in radians per second. Question 2: What is the relation between linear and angular displacement? Linear displacement refers to the distance an object travels in a straight line, while angular displacement refers to the angle through which an object rotates. The relation between linear displacement (s) and angular displacement (θ) can be formulated as: s = r * θ where r is the radius of the circle formed by the path of the object in motion and θ is the angular displacement in radians. Now, let's compare the two questions: Question 1 is asking for the relation between linear velocity and angular velocity, while Question 2 is asking for the relation between linear displacement and angular displacement.

The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour.

Carla then takes a big bite out of both sandwiches and returns to her room as if nothing happened. Answer the following question: Which sandwich was in the microwave for a longer period of time? A:","completion":"Based on the provided background information and the situation, it can be inferred that sandwich A was in the microwave for a longer period of time compared to sandwich B. The rationale behind this inference is the relationship between the temperature and the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. As the temperature increases due to the microwave heating, the particles of matter in the sandwich move more quickly, thus having a higher average kinetic energy. In the given situation, Carla observed that the average kinetic energy in sandwich A is higher than that in sandwich B. This indicates that the particles in sandwich A were moving faster, resulting from it being warmer. Since the microwave's primary function is to heat up food, it is reasonable to deduce that sandwich A was subjected to a longer period of microwaving compared to sandwich B. Consequently, as sandwich A had a higher average kinetic energy and felt warmer, it can be concluded that it was microwaved for a longer duration than sandwich B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) God and Lucifer are engaged in a war for the souls of humanity; a standing wager for the souls of all mankind. Angels and demons are forbidden to manifest on Earth, but they are allowed to possess and influence humans, and half-breeds are used to peddle influence. Exorcist John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with the power to see angels and demons. At age 15, he committed suicide to escape his visions, but he was revived after spending two minutes in Hell, though John explains that since time moves differently in Hell 2 minutes feels like a full lifetime. Consequently, his soul is bound for Hell when he dies for the sin of taking his own life. John exorcises a girl possessed by a soldier demon trying to break through to Earth, something that should not be possible, as demons cannot take their true physical form on the mortal plane. John seeks an audience with the androgynous half-breed angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton). He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer; but Gabriel declines, telling John that his motives for exorcising demons are selfish and will not earn him entry into Heaven. After he leaves Gabriel, John repels an attack by a full demon out in the open. This encounter prompts him to meet with former witch doctor Papa Midnite (Djimon Hounsou) who informs him that all of Hell is waiting for him to die and that he is the one soul Lucifer would come to collect himself. There, John also encounters half-breed demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale). Midnite refuses to become involved, wanting to retain the balance between Heaven and Hell. John begins investigating the situation with his associates Beeman (Max Baker), Hennessy (Pruitt Taylor Vince), and Chas Kramer (Shia LaBeouf).

Paragraph: The after-action review had treated the CIA as the lead agency for any offensive against al Qaeda, and the principals, at their March 10 meeting, had endorsed strengthening the CIA's capability for that role. To the CTC, that meant proceeding with \\"The Plan,\\" which it had put forward half a year earlier-hiring and training more case officers and building up the capabilities of foreign security services that provided intelligence via liaison. On occasion, as in Jordan in December 1999, these liaison services took direct action against al Qaeda cells. In the CTC and higher up, the CIA's managers believed that they desperately needed funds just to continue their current counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that the millennium alert had already used up all of the Center's funds for the current fiscal year; the Bin Laden unit had spent 140 percent of its allocation. Tenet told us he met with Berger to discuss funding for counterterrorism just two days after the principals' meeting. While Clarke strongly favored giving the CIA more money for counterterrorism, he differed sharply with the CIA's managers about where it should come from. They insisted that the CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end of the Cold War. Their ability to perform any mission, counterterrorism included, they argued, depended on preserving what they had, restoring what they had lost since the beginning of the 1990s, and building from there-with across-the-board recruitment and training of new case officers, and the reopening of closed stations. To finance the counterterrorism effort, Tenet had gone to congressional leaders after the 1998 embassy bombings and persuaded them to give the CIA a special supplemental appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of the millennium alert, Tenet wanted a boost in overall funds for the CIA and another supplemental appropriation specifically for counterterrorism. To Clarke, this seemed evidence that the CIA's leadership did not give sufficient priority to the battle against Bin Laden and al Qaeda. He told us that James Pavitt, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, \\"said if there's going to be money spent on going after Bin Laden, it should be given to him. My view was that he had had a lot of money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put more good money after bad.\\" The CIA had a very different attitude: Pavitt told us that while the CIA's Bin Laden unit did\\"extraordinary and commendable work,\\" his chief of station in London \\"was just as much part of the al Qaeda struggle as an officer sitting in [the Bin Laden unit].\\" The dispute had large managerial implications, for Clarke had found Ailies in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Spinal discs are parts of the body. If the body is dehydrated, the discs will also be dehydrated. Water is essential for optimum health of fibrocartilage of the discs. Dehydration will make it harder and difficult to regain normal shape and function. Drink about 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water each day. Blood circulation to your back area should be good to reach that water. Our normal body pH is 7.4 which is slightly alkaline (pH 7 is neutral). It helps to deposit calcium in immature bones and cartilage. If the body's pH becomes acidic, various alkaline substances including calcium tend to neutralize the excess acid. Therefore calcium is lost from bones and cartilages, drying them out. Coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, refined sugar, junk foods, fast foods, overcooked foods, refined breads, meat, etc. make our body acidic. Try to avoid them. Raw foods, particularly vegetables, are good to maintain alkalinity of blood and body tissue. Consuming too much milk also makes the blood pH acidic although it is a good source of calcium. Calcium is the building block of the bones. It is also important for optimum health of cartilage. Calcium strengthens vertebral discs as well as fibrocartilages. It is particularly important for the elderly and post-menopausal females, who are more prone to develop calcium deficit and fractures. Nut-milks, nut-butters (not peanut butter), nuts, seeds, green vegetables like broccoli, green leaves and sprouts are examples of calcium rich foods. You may also take calcium supplements if you are doubtful about dietary sources or if you have a recognized calcium deficit. Take Tab Calcium 500 mg or Tab Calcium+ Vitamin D preparation once daily until your symptoms disappear completely. . Regular exercising is very good for bones and joints functioning. Any form of exercising like yoga aerobics or simple walking, can be employed. Here's how it helps: By strengthening back muscles, weight bearing potential is improved. Increases spinal flexibility. By strengthening belly muscles and muscles of legs and arms, weight is evenly distributed and this reduces back strain. Age related bone loss is significantly minimized, thus making the spines strong and able to withstand the stress. . You might have noticed that obese people complain more of backache, disc prolapse and all other sorts of spine problems. When you are upright, your weight is supported by the spine, so the spine has to bear the additional stress when a person is obese. This causes minor injuries and degeneration. Try to keep your weight at an ideal limit for your height. Your doctor will be able to pinpoint a good weight for you and start you on a plan to lose weight and exercise safely. Even a few pounds can make a difference! Summary:","completion":"Spinal discs are parts of our body that need water and good nutrients to stay healthy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You will want to use a pressed powder to use as eyeliner, which is powder that is tightly compressed and does not move around inside its container. An example of pressed powder is virtually any eyeshadow on the market; they are generally sold as pressed powders to prevent mess and spills. Most of the time, if you want to use pressed powder to apply as eyeliner, you will be using an eyeshadow. Using pressed powder as eyeliner is generally the easiest method because it requires the least amount of precision and has a smudged, not-too-defined effect. The type of brush that you use will affect how the makeup looks on the client’s eyes. A small brush with tight bristles will create a very defined, precise effect. The smaller and tighter the brush and bristles, the more defined the look. A larger brush with loose bristles will create a loose, smudged effect that is not very precise. You will want to make sure that your brush is clean and doesn’t have remnants of old makeup on it. Spray isopropyl alcohol on the brush. It should dry in a few minutes or less. You can clean your brushes by using a makeup cleaning spray from Sephora, which dries relatively quickly, depending on the size of the brush. Smaller brushes will dry faster than large brushes. Isopropyl alcohol spray is available at drug stores, beauty supply stores, and can be ordered off websites such as Amazon.com. You can disinfect your powder by scraping off the top layer of powder with a dry tissue or by spraying isopropyl alcohol onto it. You may have to wait fifteen minutes or so for the powder to dry if you use alcohol spray on it, so do this only if you have enough time. Ask the client to close their eyes. Place your thumb on the client’s cheekbone and your pointer finger above the eyebrow. Gently stretch the skin so that it is not wrinkled or creased on the eyelid. Gently tap the powder onto the desired area of the eye. Powder does not last for very long on the brush, so you will have to re-dip your brush into the powder several times to get an even application. Dampening the brush with water will yield a more precise application. Repeat the application of the powder onto the eyelid until you achieve the desired result. A heavier application will result in a darker, more dramatic look.","completion":"This article is about using pressed powder, like eyeshadow, as eyeliner and how to apply it for different effects with various brushes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (French: [ʃaʁlkamij sɛ̃sɑ̃s]; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius.
