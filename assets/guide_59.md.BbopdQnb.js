Here is a hypothesis: Worshipping the deities were the only reason people came to the Buddhist temples. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The premise merely states that people went to Buddhist temples to worship the feminine Kannon deities, resculpted to represent Mary and Jesus. This does not provide direct evidence or imply that this act of worship was the only reason for people visiting the temples. Buddhist temples are not solely places of worship; they play a variety of roles within their societies. They can be centres for community gathering, education, celebration of important events, meditation, and spiritual guidance. Historically, Buddhist temples have also often been places of refuge during times of conflict or crisis. Therefore, people could have come to the Buddhist temples for an array of reasons beyond worshipping the deities. Furthermore, worship activities within Buddhist temples are usually multifaceted. While devotion to deities is a part of religious life, Buddhists are also engaged in sutra chanting, meditation, offerings, and teachings of the Eightfold Path and the Four Noble Truths, which are central to Buddhist practices. The premise and hypothesis also appear to be discussing a specific historic context in which Buddhist statues were adapted to resemble Christian figures, likely during a period of Christian suppression. Again, this does not mean that the modified sculptures were the sole purpose for temple visits, since religious suppression periods often entail a covert continuation of the suppressed religion's customs and practices. In conclusion, the premise does not sufficiently justify the hypothesis being true. A more full view of the societal, historical, and religious context of temple visits would be necessary for a more accurate determination. Further investigation would be required to comprehensively understand the motivations behind visits to these Buddhist temples."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Answer: B). it is not possible to tell. Explanation: In the perspective of logical entailment in linguistics, Sentence 1 discusses the speaker's positive experience with an unspecified event and mentions that the atmosphere was good and fun. Sentence 2 states that the atmosphere got better with time. However, Sentence 1 does not provide any details about the change in the atmosphere over time, it only states that it was good. Hence, we cannot confirm if the atmosphere improved over time based solely on Sentence 1. Therefore, we cannot say that Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. Option A, \\"yes,\\" is incorrect because there is no explicit mention in Sentence 1 that suggests the atmosphere improved over time, and Option C, \\"no,\\" is also incorrect because we do not have enough information to deny the statement that the atmosphere improved over time.

UPDATED:. 13:34 EST, 28 August 2013. When it comes to running, women may get more out of high intensity interval training than their male counterparts. Many gym goers have learnt to dread interval training but new research suggests that it may be the best way for women to get maximum benefits from exercise. The research shows that when it comes to running, women may get more out of high intensity interval training than their male counterparts. Earlier interval training studies primarily focused on highly trained males, but researchers say that they overlooked the variety of other populations that routinely use interval training. Drs Matt Laurent and Matt Kutz, at Bowling Green State University, Lauren Vervaecke, at the University of South Carolina, and Dr Matt Green at the University of North Alabama, put eight men and eight women between the ages of 19 and 30 through self-paced, high intensity interval training using different recovery periods. All of them reported at least a moderate fitness level and participation in at least one session of interval training a week. Participants used a treadmill for six, four-minute intervals performed at the highest intensity they felt they could maintain. Recovery periods between intervals consisted of one minute, two minute or four minute breaks. Throughout the intervals, the participants’ maximum oxygen consumption and heart rates were measured. Results revealed a significant effect of gender on both percentages. Across the trials, men self-selected a faster relative pace, but the women worked at a higher percentage of their maximum heart rate than the men, and a higher percentage of their maximum oxygen consumption. ‘I think what our data show is that there appear to be meaningful differences in how men and women self-regulate their workouts,’ Dr Laurent said. ‘Specifically, in our case, men and women tend to work at the same level of perceived exertion and feel similarly recovered between each interval, however, as they perform the interval runs women tended to work “harder” from a relative cardiovascular standpoint than men.’ Results also confirmed previous findings suggesting that a 2:1 work-to-rest ratio is optimal during HIIT for both men and women. The results also confirmed previous findings suggesting that a 2:1 work-to-rest ratio is optimal during high intensity interval training for both men and women. ‘I really think one of the “take home” points from our study was, despite the gender differences that we found, individuals performing high-intensity interval training should listen to, and trust, their body and pay attention to how they are feeling,’ said Dr Laurent. ‘Without having any feedback about their data, all the participants had to use to set their pace was how they felt during the run and how recovered they felt. ‘In that sense, when runners perform high-intensity intervals, trust that if you push yourself to run what you consider hard, you are probably at the correct intensity, and if you maintain recommended work-to-rest ratios you most likely will recover appropriately to get the most out of your workout, independent of gender.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. Women may benefit more from high-intensity interval training (HIIT) than men when it comes to running, according to new research. 2.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. I am facing a new situation today: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing.

Fact 1: When a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun , that hemisphere receives more direct sunlight. Fact 2: During the summer in Britain the sunlight strikes the Northern part of the Earth more directly. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"When is a hemisphere tilted towards the sun?\\" with the following options: - mild - Vernal equinox - autumn - Spring - Summer - positive - Autumnal Equinox - Tropical The answer to this question is:","completion":"Summer. In a more detailed explanation, the axial tilt of the Earth has a significant impact on the distribution and intensity of sunlight received by each hemisphere. When a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, that hemisphere experiences summer as it receives more direct sunlight. This increased sunlight results in longer days, higher temperatures, and more solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. During the summer season, the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the sun. This causes regions such as Britain to receive more direct sunlight, resulting in warmer and longer days. Conversely, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun during winter, it receives less direct sunlight, leading to shorter, colder days. The term \\"vernal equinox\\" refers to the time of year when the sun is directly above the equator, and day and night are of equal length. This event occurs around March 20th or 21st and marks the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Similarly, the \\"autumnal equinox\\" occurs around September 22nd or 23rd and indicates the start of autumn. During these equinoxes, neither hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The other options provided include \\"mild,\\" \\"autumn,\\" \\"spring,\\" \\"positive,\\" and \\"tropical,\\" which are not relevant to the question of when a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. It is crucial to note that while the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer, the Southern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun and undergoes its winter season. In conclusion, the correct option for \\"when is a hemisphere tilted towards the sun\\" is \\"summer.\\" During summer, a hemisphere receives more direct sunlight, causing longer days and higher temperatures generally associated with this season."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At this time, the system could provide positioning data between longitude 55°E to 180°E and from latitude 55°S to 55°N.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"Certainly! The BeiDou-2 system, also known as COMPASS, is a Chinese satellite navigation system that was developed to provide global coverage as an alternative to American GPS, Russian GLONASS, and European Galileo systems. In December 2012, the BeiDou-2 system began offering coverage for the Asia-Pacific region, marking an important milestone in its development. At that time, the BeiDou-2 system's coverage was limited to positions between longitude 55°E and 180°E, and from latitude 55°S to 55°N. This encompasses a vast area that includes most parts of Asia, as well as portions of the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the region around Australia. The establishment of BeiDou-2's coverage in the Asia-Pacific region demonstrates the system's growing capabilities and China's commitment to providing accurate positioning data not only for its own nation but also for its neighbors and allies. The BeiDou-2 system plays a key role in various fields, such as transportation, weather forecasting, emergency services, and defense. Over the years, China has continued to improve the BeiDou system, launching additional satellites, expanding coverage, and enhancing signal accuracy. In July 2020, China completed the launch of its BeiDou-3 constellation, extending the system's coverage to the entire globe and further solidifying itself as a major player in the global satellite navigation market. In summary, the answer to the question \\"In what continent did the BeiDou-2 system begin offering coverage in December 2012?\\" is Asia-Pacific.

Q:Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: The bald eagle flew over the potato fields over what region of the place known for them? Possible A: alaska, hells canyon, south lake tahoe, central idaho, canada Why is \\"central idaho\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Central Idaho\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. First and foremost, Idaho is widely known for its vast potato fields. The state of Idaho is the leading producer of potatoes in the United States, growing around one-third of the country's potatoes. Idaho's potato industry has a significant impact on its economy, and its potatoes are renowned for their high quality and taste. Therefore, it is sensible to associate potato fields with Idaho. Secondly, the bald eagle, which is the national bird and symbol of the United States, is also a common inhabitant of various regions in the country, including Idaho. The state's diverse landscape, which includes high mountain regions, forests, and rivers, provides an ideal habitat for bald eagles, as they need access to water and prey, such as fish. In Idaho, bald eagles can be found near lakes, reservoirs, and rivers, including protected areas within national forests and wildlife management areas. Among the other options in the question, some can be ruled out as less plausible, based on human common sense. For example, while Hells Canyon is located along the border of Idaho and Oregon, it is a deep gorge that follows the Snake River and is not an area typically known for agricultural production, let alone potato fields. South Lake Tahoe, situated in California near the border with Nevada, is known for its picturesque lake and ski resort, rather than potato farming. Alaska and Canada, being separate from the contiguous United States, are not the focus of a question inquiring about a \\"place known for [potato fields].\\" Furthermore, Idaho's climate, soil, and irrigation systems support the successful cultivation of potatoes. Idaho's central region, which includes the Snake River Plain, has a special combination of volcanic soil that is fertile and well-draining, and a climate that provides a consistent growing season with low humidity, which helps to control diseases and pests. Additionally, potatoes require ample water, and central Idaho's abundant water resources from rivers and reservoirs supplement irrigation needs for the area's vast potato fields. In summary, \\"central Idaho\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense due to its strong association with potato farming, the presence of bald eagles in the region, the suitability of Idaho's environment for potato cultivation, and the lesser plausibility of the other options provided. The coherence of these factors imbues the answer \\"central Idaho\\" with a sensibility that reflects common human understanding of the context provided in the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - A wide receiver (also referred to as wideouts or simply receivers) is an offensive position in American and Canadian football, and is the key player in most of the passing plays. They get their name because they are split out \\"wide\\" (near the sidelines), furthest away from the rest of the team. Wide receivers are among the fastest players on the field. The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist. - The Oakland Raiders are a professional American football franchise based in Oakland, California. The team commenced operations in 1960 as a member of the American Football League (AFL); they are currently members of the National Football League (NFL), which merged with the AFL in 1970. The Raiders currently compete in the NFL as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division and play their home games at the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum. At the end of the NFL's 2015 season, the Raiders boasted a lifetime regular season record of 444 wins, 397 losses, and 11 ties; their lifetime playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 18 losses.

Question: Phoebe encounters who in the forest? Movie title: The Monster Squad Movie plot: The Monster Squad is a society of young pre-teens who idolize classic monsters and monster movies and hold their meetings in a tree clubhouse. Club leader Sean (Andre Gower), whose five-year-old sister Phoebe (Ashley Bank) desperately wants to join the club, is given the diary of legendary vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing (Jack Gwillim) - but his excitement is toned down when he finds it's written in German. Sean, his best friend Patrick (Robby Kiger), and the rest of the Monster Squad visit an elderly man, known as the \\"Scary German Guy\\" (Leonardo Cimino), actually a kind gentleman, to translate the diary. When the Monster Squad wonders how the German man is knowledgeable about Van Helsing's battle with monsters, he wryly comments that \\"he has some experience with monsters\\" and his shirt sleeve briefly reveals a concentration camp tattoo.The diary describes, in great detail, an amulet that is composed of concentrated good. One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable to destruction, and the next day of balance falls within a couple days, at the stroke of midnight. The kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet before the day of balance arrives; once they have the amulet, the kids can use it with an incantation from Van Helsing's diary to open a hole in the universe and cast the monsters into Limbo. As shown in the prelude, van Helsing had unsuccessfully attempted this one hundred years ago in order to defeat his old adversary Count Dracula; his apprentices then emigrated to the United States to hide the amulet, where it was out of Dracula's immediate reach.Dracula, meanwhile, seeks to obtain the amulet before the Monster Squad does, so that the Count can take control of the world and plunge it into darkness. To this end he assembles several monstrous allies: a mummy, and an amphibious gill-man, and a Wolfman, in addition to three school girls (Mary Albee, Joan-Carrol Baron, and Julie Merrill) whom the Count... Answer:","completion":"The given film plot for \\"The Monster Squad\\" provides rich detail about the storyline, characters, and their encounters. However, it doesn't specifically mention who Phoebe encounters in the forest. This means I cannot provide a direct answer to your question based on the information given. However, if I were to consider the full storyline of the film which isn't included here, it's known that Phoebe, the younger sister of the club leader Sean, encounters Frankenstein's Monster in the forest. This encounter is a crucial point in the movie as she befriends the Monster, who is perceived as a threat by the Monster Squad. This bond plays a significant role towards the end of the film. But, if you were to invest in a film proposal, you'd want to focus on a few factors beyond the script detail such as the production team's track record, the marketability of the story, and the potential for return on investment. Investing in a film is a risky business because a film's success isn't guaranteed and depends on a myriad of factors. So you might want to consider factors like the film's budget, the projected revenue, the team involved in the project (including actors, director, cinematographer and so on), and the potential audience for the film. This is in addition to the story detail (like who Phoebe encounters in the forest) which could affect the film's reception. The genre of the film, \\"The Monster Squad,\\" is a mix of horror and comedy, also known as horror-comedy, which has a niche but steady audience base. Moreover, investing in a remake or reboot of a film like \\"The Monster Squad\\"- if that's the proposal- comes with both opportunities (nostalgic fan base, already established storyline, characters and universe) and challenges (potential negative comparisons to the original, high expectations etc.). To sum up, while character interactions and plot twists are important, they're just a piece of the puzzle.

Please write a short summary for the following article: NYPD officers in fresh assault claims: 'They were taking turns like a gang' The New York police department is facing renewed questions over the conduct of its personnel after a man alleged he was viciously assaulted without provocation by a group of uniformed officers. Santiago Hernandez, 23, claims that he was kicked, punched and zapped with pepper spray by up to six officers in 157th Street in the Bronx on 18 August. A video of his arrest captured by a nearby security camera and published by the local TV channel ABC 7 shows the police initially frisking him, then handcuffing him and finally piling on top of Hernandez as he lay on the sidewalk while apparently hitting him with batons. “They was taking turns on me. One kicks me, he steps back. Another one comes to punch me and he steps back. And another one comes and grabs my arm and hits me like 10 times with the baton. Another one comes and pepper sprayed me … they were taking turns like a gang,” he told ABC 7. The new allegations, that are being investigated by the NYPD’s internal affairs section, come at a difficult time for the force and its high-profile commissioner Bill Bratton. A grand jury has been called to decide whether to bring charges against an NYPD officer involved in the attempted arrest in Staten Island of Eric Garner for selling loose cigarettes. Garner, 43, died on 17 July as he was put in a chokehold – a procedure that has been banned in the force since 1993 – by officer Daniel Pantaleo, and was heard on video footage of the arrest saying, “I can’t breathe”. Last month a medical examiner found Garner had died of compression to his neck and chest, and declared his death a homicide. Bratton, whose career has been built upon his reputation for improving relations between law enforcers and the public, has has been rattled by the Garner death. In January he took up the job of NYPD chief, which he previously held in the 1990s, vowing to end the hostility that had been generated by the widely criticized “stop and frisk” policy. On Monday, Bratton faced two hours of questioning over the incident from the New York city council, focusing on the commissioner’s plans to retrain all 35,000 NYPD uniformed officers in how to make arrests with the minimum use of force. In addition to the training, the commissioner has also ordered the use of body cameras by some officers on patrol to record all their communications with individuals. Lawyers representing Hernandez in the new controversy have told ABC 7 that they will be bringing a civil complaint against the police. Hernandez, who is currently on parole having served six years in prison for gang assault, said he was left bruised by his treatment. He insists that all he did in the moments before he was allegedly assaulted was to ask officers simple questions such as why he was being searched and handcuffed. “I’m a person to ask questions. If I didn’t do nothing wrong, I’m trying to understand the reason,” he said. Summary:","completion":"The New York Police Department (NYPD) is facing allegations of assault by a man who claims he was attacked without provocation by a group of uniformed officers.

Why do US troops visit Tajikistan every so often?","completion":"The text suggests that the United States Army and Marine Corps personnel periodically visit Tajikistan to conduct joint training missions. While the specific reasons are not detailed in the text, we can infer several likely reasons based on the given information and the general context. As the text indicates, Tajikistan is strategically located near Afghanistan, where the US has been engaged in military operations since 2001. Training in Tajikistan provides an opportunity for the US military personnel to adapt to the unique conditions and challenges that they might face in Afghanistan or similar operational environments. Joint training missions also facilitate inter-operability, allowing U.S. troops to work together with Tajik forces effectively. Tajikistan, being a part of NATO's Partnership for Peace program, shares the goal of promoting and maintaining stability in the Euro-Atlantic region. Therefore, these training missions could help the US and Tajikistan respond collectively to security threats. The US has an interest in counterterrorism, especially given the proximity of Afghanistan, and these joint training sessions could thus enhance the counter-terrorism capabilities of both the US and Tajik forces. Furthermore, the joint exercises could also serve diplomatic purposes, creating a stronger rapport between the United States and Tajikistan, which could translate into broader military, political, and economic cooperation. Lastly, training missions and visits may also be related to overseeing and ensuring the effective use of financial aid and military support the US provides to Tajikistan to help it secure its borders and combat transnational threats.

Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.

Introduction Loss of insects is certain to have adverse effects on ecosystem functioning, as insects play a central role in a variety of processes, including pollination [1, 2], herbivory and detrivory [3, 4], nutrient cycling [4] and providing a food source for higher trophic levels such as birds, mammals and amphibians. For example, 80% of wild plants are estimated to depend on insects for pollination [2], while 60% of birds rely on insects as a food source [5]. The ecosystem services provided by wild insects have been estimated at 57 billion annually in the USA [6]. Clearly, preserving insect abundance and diversity should constitute a prime conservation priority. Current data suggest an overall pattern of decline in insect diversity and abundance. For example, populations of European grassland butterflies are estimated to have declined by 50% in abundance between 1990 and 2011 [7]. Data for other well-studied taxa such as bees [8–14] and moths [15–18] suggest the same trend. Climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, and deterioration of habitat quality have been proposed as some of the prime suspects responsible for the decline [9–11, 13, 18–22]. However, the number of studies on insect trends with sufficient replication and spatial coverage are limited [10, 23–25] and restricted to certain well-studied taxa. Declines of individual species or taxa (e.g. [7, 26]) may not reflect the general state of local entomofauna [27]. The total insect biomass would then be a better metric for the status of insects as a group and its contribution to ecosystem functioning, but very few studies have monitored insect biomass over an extensive period of time [28]. Hence, to what extent total insect biomass has declined, and the relative contribution of each proposed factor to the decline, remain unresolved yet highly relevant questions for ecosystem ecology and conservation. Here, we investigate total aerial insect biomass between 1989 and 2016 across 96 unique location-year combinations in Germany, representative of Western European low-altitude nature protection areas embedded in a human-dominated landscape (S1 Fig). In all years we sampled insects throughout the season (March through October), based on a standardized sampling scheme using Malaise traps. We investigated rate of decline in insect biomass, and examined how factors such as weather, habitat and land use variables influenced the declines. Knowledge on the state of insect biomass, and it’s direction over time, are of broad importance to ecology and conservation, but historical data on insect biomass have been lacking. Our study makes a first step into filling this gap, and provides information that is vital for the assessment of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem health in agricultural landscapes. Discussion Our results document a dramatic decline in average airborne insect biomass of 76% (up to 82% in midsummer) in just 27 years for protected nature areas in Germany. This considerably exceeds the estimated decline of 58% in global abundance of wild vertebrates over a 42-year period to 2012 [56, 57]. Our results demonstrate that recently reported declines in several taxa such as butterflies [7, 25–27, 58], wild bees [8–14] and moths [15–18], are in parallel with a severe loss of total aerial insect biomass, suggesting that it is not only the vulnerable species, but the flying insect community as a whole, that has been decimated over the last few decades. The estimated decline is considerably more severe than the only comparable long term study on flying insect biomass elsewhere [28]. In that study, 12.2m high suction traps were deployed at four locations in the UK over the time period 1973–2002, and showed a biomass decline at one of the four sites only. However, the sampling designs differ considerably between the two studies. Suction traps mainly target high-flying insects, and in that study the catches were largely comprised of flies belonging to the Bibionidae family. Contrary, malaise traps as used in the present study target insects flying close to the ground surface (up to 1 meter), with a much wider diversity of taxa. Future investigations should look into how biomass is distributed among insect species, and how species trends contribute to the biomass decline. Although the present dataset spans a relatively large number of years (27) and sites (63), the number of repetitions (i.e. multiple years of seasonal distributions at the same locations) was lower (n = 26). We are however confident that our estimated rate of decline in total biomass resembles the true rate of decline, and is not an artifact of site selection. Firstly, our basic model (including an annual rate of decline) outperformed the null-model (without an annual rate of decline; ΔDIC = 822.62 units; Table 3), while at the same time, between-plot variation (i.s. σ site ) and residual variation (v) decreased by 44.3 and 9.7% respectively, after incorporating an annual rate of decline into the models. Secondly, using only data from sites at which malaise traps were operating in at least two years, we estimated a rate of decline similar to using the full dataset (Fig 4), with the pattern of decline being congruent across locations (S4 Fig). Taken together, there does not seem to be evidence that spatial variation (between sites) in this dataset forms a confounding factor to the estimated temporal trend, and conclude that our estimated biomass decline is representative for lowland protected areas in west Germany. In light of previously suggested driving mechanisms, our analysis renders two of the prime suspects, i.e. landscape [9, 18, 20] and climate change [15, 18, 21, 37], as unlikely explanatory factors for this major decline in aerial insect biomass in the investigated protected areas. Habitat change was evaluated in terms of changes in plant species composition surrounding the standardized trap locations, and in plant species characteristics (Ellenberg values). Land use changes was evaluated in terms of proportional surface changes in aerial photographs, and not for example changes in management regimes. Given the major decline in insect biomass of about 80%, much stronger relationships would have been expected if changes in habitat and land use were the driving forces, even with the somewhat crude parameters that were at our disposal. The decline in insect biomass, being evident throughout the growing season, and irrespective of habitat type or landscape configuration, suggests large-scale factors must be involved. While some temporal changes in climatic variables in our study area have taken place, these either were not of influence (e.g. wind speed), or changed in a manner that should have increased insect biomass (e.g temperature). However, we have not exhaustively analysed the full range of climatic variables that could potentially impact insect biomass. For example prolonged droughts, or lack of sunshine especially in low temperatures might have had an effect on insect biomass [59–62]. Agricultural intensification [17, 20] (e.g. pesticide usage, year-round tillage, increased use of fertilizers and frequency of agronomic measures) that we could not incorporate in our analyses, may form a plausible cause. The reserves in which the traps were placed are of limited size in this typical fragmented West-European landscape, and almost all locations (94%) are enclosed by agricultural fields. Part of the explanation could therefore be that the protected areas (serving as insect sources) are affected and drained by the agricultural fields in the broader surroundings (serving as sinks or even as ecological traps) [1, 63–65]. Increased agricultural intensification may have aggravated this reduction in insect abundance in the protected areas over the last few decades. Whatever the causal factors responsible for the decline, they have a far more devastating effect on total insect biomass than has been appreciated previously. The widespread insect biomass decline is alarming, ever more so as all traps were placed in protected areas that are meant to preserve ecosystem functions and biodiversity. While the gradual decline of rare insect species has been known for quite some time (e.g. specialized butterflies [9, 66]), our results illustrate an ongoing and rapid decline in total amount of airborne insects active in space and time. Agricultural intensification, including the disappearance of field margins and new crop protection methods has been associated with an overall decline of biodiversity in plants, insects, birds and other species in the current landscape [20, 27, 67]. The major and hitherto unrecognized loss of insect biomass that we report here for protected areas, adds a new dimension to this discussion, because it must have cascading effects across trophic levels and numerous other ecosystem effects. There is an urgent need to uncover the causes of this decline, its geographical extent, and to understand the ramifications of the decline for ecosystems and ecosystem services.

Insects are an integral part of life on Earth as both pollinators and prey for other wildlife and it was known that some species such as butterflies were declining. But the newly revealed scale of the losses to all insects has prompted warnings that the world is “on course for ecological Armageddon”, with profound impacts on human society. Share your pictures of insects around the world Read more The new data was gathered in nature reserves across Germany but has implications for all landscapes dominated by agriculture, the researchers said. The cause of the huge decline is as yet unclear, although the destruction of wild areas and widespread use of pesticides are the most likely factors and climate change may play a role. The scientists were able to rule out weather and changes to landscape in the reserves as causes, but data on pesticide levels has not been collected. “The fact that the number of flying insects is decreasing at such a high rate in such a large area is an alarming discovery,” said Hans de Kroon, at Radboud University in the Netherlands and who led the new research. “Insects make up about two-thirds of all life on Earth [but] there has been some kind of horrific decline,” said Prof Dave Goulson of Sussex University, UK, and part of the team behind the new study. “We appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse.” The research, published in the journal Plos One, is based on the work of dozens of amateur entomologists across Germany who began using strictly standardised ways of collecting insects in 1989. Special tents called malaise traps were used to capture more than 1,500 samples of all flying insects at 63 different nature reserves. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The malaise traps set in protected areas and reserves, which scientists say makes the declines even more worrying. Photograph: Courtesy of Courtesy of Entomologisher Verein Krefeld When the total weight of the insects in each sample was measured a startling decline was revealed. The annual average fell by 76% over the 27 year period, but the fall was even higher – 82% – in summer, when insect numbers reach their peak. Previous reports of insect declines have been limited to particular insects, such European grassland butterflies, which have fallen by 50% in recent decades. But the new research captured all flying insects, including wasps and flies which are rarely studied, making it a much stronger indicator of decline. The fact that the samples were taken in protected areas makes the findings even more worrying, said Caspar Hallmann at Radboud University, also part of the research team: “All these areas are protected and most of them are well-managed nature reserves. Yet, this dramatic decline has occurred.” The amateur entomologists also collected detailed weather measurements and recorded changes to the landscape or plant species in the reserves, but this could not explain the loss of the insects. “The weather might explain many of the fluctuations within the season and between the years, but it doesn’t explain the rapid downward trend,” said Martin Sorg from the Krefeld Entomological Society in Germany, who led the amateur entomologists. Goulson said a likely explanation could be that the flying insects perish when they leave the nature reserves. “Farmland has very little to offer for any wild creature,” he said. “But exactly what is causing their death is open to debate. It could be simply that there is no food for them or it could be, more specifically, exposure to chemical pesticides, or a combination of the two.” In September, a chief scientific adviser to the UK government warned that regulators around the world have falsely assumed that it is safe to use pesticides at industrial scales across landscapes and that the “effects of dosing whole landscapes with chemicals have been largely ignored”. The scientists said further work is urgently needed to corroborate the new findings in other regions and to explore the issue in more detail. While most insects do fly, it may be that those that don’t, leave nature reserves less often and are faring better. It is also possible that smaller and larger insects are affected differently, and the German samples have all been preserved and will be further analysed. In the meantime, said De Kroon: “We need to do less of the things that we know have a negative impact, such as the use of pesticides and the disappearance of farmland borders full of flowers.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest As well as being pollinators insects provide food for birds and other animals and help control pests. Photograph: Kevin Elsby/Alamy Lynn Dicks at the University of East Anglia, UK, and not involved in the new research said the work was convincing. “It provides important new evidence for an alarming decline that many entomologists have suspected is occurring for some time.” “If total flying insect biomass is genuinely declining at this rate – about 6% per year – it is extremely concerning,” she said. “Flying insects have really important ecological functions, for which their numbers matter a lot. They pollinate flowers: flies, moths and butterflies are as important as bees for many flowering plants, including some crops. They provide food for many animals – birds, bats, some mammals, fish, reptiles and amphibians. Flies, beetles and wasps are also predators and decomposers, controlling pests and cleaning up the place generally.” Climate change could wipe out a third of parasite species, study finds Read more Another way of sampling insects – car windscreens – has often been anecdotally used to suggest a major decline, with people remembering many more bugs squashed on their windscreens in the past. “I think that is real,” said Goulson. “I drove right across France and back this summer – just when you’d expect your windscreen to be splattered all over – and I literally never had to stop to clean the windscreen.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A new study has found that the number of flying insects has declined by 76% over the past 27 years. The scale of the drop has alarmed scientists who stress that insects are essential for pollination and as a food source for other animals. The research, carried out in nature reserves across Germany, is the first to study all flying insects, including rarely studied species such as wasps and flies, rather than just specific groups such as butterflies. The cause of the loss remains unknown, but habitat destruction, pesticide use and climate change may all play a part."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Article: Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Answer: OPT: A).

Please answer the following question: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

What are the most important words in the following sentence: two sub trains sitting on tracks next to a station","completion":"The most important words in the sentence \\"Two sub trains sitting on tracks next to a station\\" are: 1. Sub trains: This phrase is the central subject of the sentence. It specifies the type of transportation being discussed, and knowing that they are sub trains immediately helps form a mental picture of the scene being described. Additionally, the number \\"two\\" is an important detail about the quantity of sub trains. 2. Tracks: The presence of tracks in the sentence is crucial as it denotes the infrastructure on which the sub trains are situated. Mentioning tracks emphasizes the close relationship between the sub trains and the railway system, while also implying that the trains are stationary or temporarily not in motion. 3. Station: The station is a key component of this sentence as it establishes the context for the location of the sub trains. By specifying that the sub trains are next to a station, the sentence conveys important information about their purpose (picking up or dropping off passengers) and their current state (waiting, preparing to depart, or having just arrived). The connection between the sub trains and the station adds meaning and context to the overall sentence. Overall, \\"sub trains,\\" \\"tracks,\\" and \\"station\\" are the most important words in this sentence as they provide essential information about the subject and the context of the scene being described."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best. BJs is no exception to this rule. The menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread. It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage. Tomatoes, yes. Cheese, yes. Sausage...not so much. There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage. As for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts. Overall not a good effort.

Step 1: Analyze the question. The question asks which evolutionary changes were the most important to Charles Darwin, the person who proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection. Step 2: Analyze the given statement. The statement provided, \\"Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding,\\" is related to Darwin's ideas on the role of selective breeding in the production of various domesticated breeds. Step 3: Compare the statement with Darwin's key evolutionary concepts. Selective breeding is an important aspect which illustrates how human intervention can lead to changes in species over generations. However, it is only a part of the overall theory of evolution by natural selection. The most important evolutionary changes to Darwin are those related to natural selection, adaptation, and the struggle for existence. Step 4: Check if the statement correctly answers the question. While the statement addresses a concept Darwin discussed, it mainly focuses on selective breeding and does not include aspects like natural selection, adaptation, or the struggle for existence. Therefore, the statement does not fully and comprehensively answer the question about the most important evolutionary changes to Darwin. Conclusion: The given statement does not correctly answer the question of which evolutionary changes were the most important to Darwin, as it only focuses on one aspect of his theory, selective breeding, and misses other key concepts like natural selection, adaptation, and the struggle for existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Human industry produces chemical compounds - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth - The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content. Question: suppose customers are not buying the products happens, how will it affect less chemical compounds produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"When customers are not buying the products, there is a direct influence on the production rate and demand for those products. In this case, businesses will adjust their manufacturing processes and decrease the production of these goods. As a result, this decrease in production will lead to less chemical compounds being generated by human industry. With reduced manufacturing activities, fewer pollutants and harmful chemicals will be emitted into the atmosphere. Consequently, there will be fewer chemical compounds released into the air, which lessens their chances of mixing with elements in clouds and forming acid rain. Now, let's analyze how this perturbation affects the second effect mentioned. The second effect is the interaction of chemical compounds with elements in clouds, which leads to the formation of acid rain. Since there are fewer chemical compounds being produced and subsequently released into the atmosphere, there will be a lower likelihood of these compounds mixing with elements in the clouds. This leads to a lesser formation of acid rain, significantly reducing its harmful effects on natural and man-made objects. The perturbation caused by customers not buying products has a direct influence on all the subsequent effects of chemical compounds production. By reducing the overall production of harmful compounds, we witness a domino effect that ultimately results in less acid rain being formed. Therefore, the supposed perturbation has a \\"less\\" effect on the second effect mentioned, as fewer chemical compounds in the atmosphere result in less acid rain formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What country did the U.S. support in its war against Iran in the 1980's?","completion":"To find out which country the U.S. supported in its war against Iran in the 1980s, I will perform the following steps: 1. Recall the relevant historical event: In this case, I know that the war being referred to is the Iran-Iraq War, which took place from 1980 to 1988. 2. Analyze period of time: During the 1980s, the United States had negative relations with Iran, particularly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the Iran hostage crisis. As a result, it is unlikely that the U.S. would have supported Iran in any conflict. 3. Determine the likely U.S. ally: Since Iraq was the other major power involved in the Iran-Iraq War, it becomes clear that the United States supported Iraq in its conflict against Iran. 4. Consider current historical knowledge: Recent declassified documents and information from public records have confirmed that the U.S. provided military and financial support to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War. Based on these steps, I can confidently conclude that the United States supported Iraq in its war against Iran in the 1980s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: a giant caterpillar for the following movie plot: La Classe de NeigeA grey Renault is being driven along a highway leading into the mountains. Nicolas (Clement van den Bergh), a boy of about twelve, is sitting in the back seat, napping. On the dashboard are photos of Nicolas, his little brother Tom, and his mother. His father (François Roy) is driving.A teacher, Miss Grimm (Emmanuelle Bercot), is orienting parents, telling them what their children will need for a stay at an outdoor education centre in the mountains. Nicolass parents arrive late, and scoff at the idea of not telephoning their son while he is away. The father reminds everyone of a group of schoolchildren who were recently killed in a horrible bus accident, and asks what guarantee they have that their children will be safe. Miss Grimm says matter-of-factly that there is Nothing. The father announces that he will drive Nicolas himself, claiming that his son arriving in his fathers car will not make him an outcast.On the drive to the class trip, the father offers to stop for gas so that Nicolas will at last have enough redemption points to get the gift he has been eager to have: a flap book of human anatomy. The father asks Nicolas if he feels he deserves it.Nicolas is anxious he might wet the bed. His father expects him to put an undersheet on his bed in front of the other boys, and dismisses his apprehension with: You cant be the only one.Nicolas wakes from a nap when backed-up traffic finally gets to move past a bad road accident. Nicolas stares at the mangled cars, while his father concentrates on driving. Nicolas recalls the family watching on television the gruesome news coverage of the recent bus accident.They arrive at the outdoor education centre, where a class is already in progress. They can see Hodkann, the class tearaway (Lokman Nalcakan), acting up. The father prompts Nicolas for a better kiss good-bye, and parts awkwardly.Miss Grimm has said they will need snow to ski, but that they will have fun in any case. Nicolas recalls a visit to a fun fair six months before. He had wanted to... The answer is:","completion":"Given the plot provided for \\"La Classe de Neige\\", the question could be formulated as follows: \\"In a dream-induced or fantasy sequence within the movie, if Nicolas encounters any unusual, perhaps giant creature symbolic of his fears and undermined yet growing self-awareness, what might that creature be?\\" The answer to this is a giant caterpillar. In the context of the story, a giant caterpillar could represent many things. Caterpillars are creatures in transition, just as Nicolas is transitioning from childhood to the cusp of adolescence. He is heading into a period of significant change - the class trip - which might transform him in the way a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly. A caterpillar must first endure a period of vulnerability and seclusion (the cocoon stage), just as Nicolas must navigate an unfamiliar and potentially uncomfortable environment on his school trip. Moreover, the giant caterpillar can symbolize the tremendous burdens or fears Nicolas carries inside him, especially regarding wetting his bed or the pressure from his father. The 'giant' aspect emphasizes how these issues weigh on him, seemingly magnifying as he confronts them alone and away from home at the outdoor educational center. Furthermore, using this creature - a caterpillar - a typically small and nondescript insect, when made giant, can symbolize the disproportionate magnitude of Nicolas's fears and discomforts compared to what is generally expected from a child his age. This dream or fantasy encounter with a 'giant caterpillar' could serve as a crucial part of the narrative for Nicolas's self-discovery, realization of personal courage, and initiation of his journey towards self maturity amidst his challenging circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I couldn't agree more with everone elses comments below. My experience started off good in 2012 when I went in for a Clear Correct Consultation. But when I went back to actually start my treatment I had a new orthodontist already. That should have been my first red flag to not come back. It took twice as long to get my trays as they had estimated, and when I'd call to check the status it was as if I was calling for the first time. No one knew what was going on, they said they'd call Clear Correct but I'd never get a return phone call. I finally had to have a stern talk with the office manager which seemed to finally help my case. But regardless, getting the actual trays took about 12 weeks instead of their 6-8 week estimate. Once I started my trays, the orthodontist and everyone that worked there was very friendly and helpful. It wasn't until about a year later (2011) that things started to shift to an unorganized mess. My (2nd) orthodontist left, I went through two other orthodontists within a matter 6 weeks, their recommendations and consultation on my trays were very inconsistent. My treatment plan which they estimated would take 16 months is now going on 28 months! I recently moved and am trying to get them to ship my trays to my new orthodontist but I am getting no where. The people who work there are great - they are super friendly and I have no doubt that the technicians, othodontist, and dentist know what they're doing.

Background: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. Paragraph: Burr township is situated on the western side of the ridge, at a lower altitude, and is experiencing atmospheric convection every once in a while, while Jolt township, on the eastern side, has a less windy, less cloudy environment and is situated at a higher altitude. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena? A:","completion":"Jolt township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena compared to Burr township. This is because Jolt township is located at a higher altitude on the eastern side of the ridge, which correlates with a less windy and less cloudy environment. Since atmospheric convection is influenced by factors such as temperature differences, wind patterns, and cloud development, the location and conditions in Jolt township result in reduced chances of atmospheric convection, leading to fewer occurrences of this phenomenon in comparison to Burr township."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A plant grows near or on a rock - The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more time occurs happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have an effect on the process, potentially leading to less or slower weathering occurring. Weathering, including the one contributed by plants, is a slow process that takes place over a long period of time. If we increase the time scale, we allow more chances for the process of weathering to occur; however, the rate of weathering does not necessarily speed up as time increases. The rate of weathering is influenced by many factors, including the hardness of the rock, the type and abundance of vegetation, the climate, and the amount of time the rock material is exposed to the weathering process. In the scenario you've presented where a plant grows near or on a rock, over time, the plant's roots can penetrate the rock, and along with the plant's natural acids, gradually break the rock apart. However, if a perturbation such as the changes in plant growth behaviors happens (maybe due to disease, changes in environment, or other), the plant's function in weathering could decrease. For instance, if plant growth is slower or the plant died, the roots would not be able to break the rock as efficiently, leading to slower weathering process. Furthermore, if the balance of plant acids changes, less rock might be dissolved over the same time span. In terms of indirect effects, a decrease in plant-mediated weathering might also impact the overall rate of erosion since less fragmented rocks coud be less susceptible to being carried away by rainwater or wind. As a result, you might observe less or slower weathering over longer periods of time with this perturbation. It's important to note that this is a simplification of complex natural processes, and real-world scenarios could be influenced by a host of interconnected factors. But in general, any perturbations that reduce the effectiveness of the plant's rock-breaking actions could lead to less or slower weathering."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Pete Rose,the famous baseball player,whom I have never met,taught me something so valuable that it changed my life.Pete was being interviewed in spring training the year he was about to break Ty Cobb's alltime hits record.One reporter asked, \\"Pete,you only need 78 hits to break the record.How many atbats do you think you'll need to get the 78 hits?\\" Without hesitation,Pete said,\\"78.\\" The reporter yelled back,\\"Ah,come on Pete.You don't expect to get 78 hits in 78 atbats,do you?\\" Mr. Rose calmly shared his rule in life with all the reporters who were anxiously awaiting his reply.\\"Every time I step up to the plate,I expect to get a hit!

But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf.

With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Ticino , formally the Republic and Canton of Ticino (; ; see also in other languages) is the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Ticino borders the Canton of Uri to the north, Valais to the west (through the Novena Pass), Graubünden to the northeast, Italy's regions of Piedmont and Lombardy to the south and it surrounds the small Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - In the study of human settlements, an urban agglomeration is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of a central place (\\"usually a municipality\\") and any suburbs linked by continuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \\"unité urbaine\\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself. - International education can mean many different things and its definition is debated. Some have defined two general meanings according to its involvement of students. The first refers to education that transcends national borders by the exchange of people, for example, by students travelling to study at an international branch campus, as part of a study abroad program or as part of a student exchange program. The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world. - Lugano is a city in southern Switzerland in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino bordering Italy. It has a population of 71,500, and an urban agglomeration over 145,000.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"- they make it increase Hurricanes have a significant impact on the amount of water contained in bodies of water. As massive storm systems, hurricanes bring torrential rains, powerful winds, and storm surges that can cause water levels to rise dramatically in affected areas. One of the primary ways in which hurricanes cause an increase in water levels is through heavy rainfall. As a hurricane moves over the ocean, it collects moisture from the warmer waters below and continuously adds it to the storm system. As the hurricane moves inland or interacts with land masses, it can drop tremendous amounts of fresh water in the form of rain. Depending on the size and intensity of the hurricane, this can lead to localized or widespread flooding in coastal areas or around bodies of water. Another way that hurricanes cause water levels to rise is through storm surges. A storm surge is a rise in sea level that occurs when strong winds from a hurricane push ocean water toward the coast. As the hurricane makes landfall, the storm surge can cause a large volume of water to move inland rapidly, flooding nearby bodies of water and potentially causing them to overflow. The combination of rapidly rising water levels and powerful waves can cause significant erosion and damage to coastlines and natural barriers, further increasing the influx of water into inland areas. Furthermore, hurricanes can impact the natural flow and drainage of water systems in the affected areas, causing temporary or permanent changes in the amount of water contained in rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water. For example, flooding caused by a hurricane can overwhelm storm drains and other municipal infrastructure, causing water to back up and spread into adjacent bodies of water. Overall, the best answer to the question of what hurricanes do to the amount of water contained in bodies of water is that they make it increase. This increase in water levels can lead to numerous environmental, economic, and social consequences, such as flooding, property damage, and displacement of communities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: What influence did the Italian opera have on the Greek theater? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Italian opera had a significant influence on the Greek theater, particularly in its early years following Greek independence in the 19th century. This influence can especially be seen in the development of the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama. The introduction of Italian opera elements into Greek theater proved to be highly popular and its impact can be observed in various aspects of the Greek theater's evolution. The Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù, the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece, played a major role in bringing Italian opera influence to the country. This was the venue where the first-ever Greek opera, Spyridon Xyndas' The Parliamentary Candidate, was performed. The opera was notable for being based on a Greek libretto, but its underlying structure, style, and form were rooted in the Italian operatic tradition. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Italian opera's influence further permeated Greek theater, as it was dominated by various forms of musical entertainment, including revues, musical comedies, operettas, and nocturnes. Iconic Greek playwrights of this era, such as Spyridon Samaras, Dionysios Lavrangas, and Theophrastos Sakellaridis, were also influenced by Italian opera styles, integrating them into their respective works. In summary, the Italian opera served as a major influence on Greek theater, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Write a title for this article: A detailed transition plan for Syria, committing the country to democratic and religious pluralism, has been unveiled by an alliance of moderate opposition groups. The move comes as the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urges Russia to end its support for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. The High Negotiation Committee (HNC), an umbrella body representing more than 30 political and military forces seeking to wrest power from Assad, unveiled its 25-page plan at a meeting in London. Johnson and his counterparts from the EU, Turkey, the US and Gulf states, were in attendance. Prior to becoming foreign secretary, Johnson had been sceptical about the value of supporting the Syrian opposition, saying there was a case for making common cause with Assad to defeat Islamic State. But Johnson has now embraced the HNC statement. In his first intervention on the Syria issue as foreign secretary, he has challenged Russia to help depose Assad. His comments mark a change of tone from March, when he praised the Kremlin for aiding Assad after Syrian troops saved the world heritage site of Palmyra from destruction by Isis. In an article for Wednesday’s edition of the Times, Johnson writes that Russia’s “seemingly indefensible” military efforts in Syria are keeping in power the “one man who bears overwhelming responsibility” for the civil war. He points to the HNC’s transition plan as an answer to what will replace Assad – “a safe space, free from terror, to which migrants can return”. The new Syrian blueprint may also persuade Hillary Clinton it is worth investing political capital in seeking a solution in Syria, and not to dismiss the five-year civil war as a battle between two equally unsavoury anti-democratic forces. In the US presidential campaign, Clinton, the Democratic candidate, has said little about her plans for Syria, the biggest foreign policy headache facing the new administration, but she is seen as more interventionist than Barack Obama. Some Clinton foreign policy aides have been proposing a Syrian partition. The HNC blueprint sets out a six-month negotiating process leading to a single transitional governing body responsible for overseeing a unitary decentralised state, leading within 18 months to parliamentary presidential and municipal elections. The vision makes an unambiguous pledge to commit to democratic non-sectarian values. Assad and his immediate clique would be excluded from the transitional body. Salem al-Meslet, spokesman for the HNC, said: “We need a lasting solution to Syria’s nightmare, not local ceasefires or temporary cessations that can be exploited by the regime and its Russian ally. “The only way to a lasting solution is through political transition, through the United Nations. That is, transition from state terrorism to a country governed according to a social contract for all the Syrian people.” The vision promises to “build a political system that protects freedoms, safeguards individual rights, and that is founded upon the principles of liberty, equality, citizenship, and justice”. It promises all Syrian groups will be represented “without discrimination or exclusion based on religion, sect, ethnicity, or class” in one homeland “where women can enjoy their full public and individual rights and are ensured constitutionally protected active contribution in all state institutions and decision-making bodies and positions by at least a 30% quota”. It also proposes that the caretaker transitional governing body form a joint military council under its authority, which would include representatives from the revolutionary forces and the regime army “who have not stained their hands with Syrian blood”. It stresses it is not seeking swaths of the Syrian state officials to quit in the kind of disastrous clear-out of thousands of regime officials that led to chaos and sectarian reprisals in Iraq in 2003. The plan addresses the need for a national dialogue and addresses the inevitable tension between the need for accountability for war crimes, and the need for political reconciliation. Diplomatic advocates of the vision say “it is a positive vision for Syria … it is extremely pragmatic, very heavy on continuity, inclusivity, excluding only a very few … it should reassure the Syrian middle that supports neither Assad or the extremists. This is an attempt to tell the international community there is a way though this conflict.” The document also sets out plans for the right of refugees to return and national reconciliation programmes to deter reprisals and ensure rights of all citizens. Writing in the Times, Johnson describes Assad as a recruiting sergeant for Islamic State and says the HNC document is the first credible portrait of Syria without Assad. He praises the HNC vision as “democratic and pluralistic, but which also makes the commonsensical assumption that you cannot just sweep away all the existing structures of the state. That was (one of) the mistakes in Iraq, and it will not be repeated.” But the plan is likely to be dismissed as a pipe dream in view of the battles and sieges raging across Syria at present, as well as the apparent unwillingness of Russia to use its influence with Assad to end his destructive air bombardment and instead reopen talks about a political transition away from his regime. There are also questions about the extent to which the HNC still speaks for the military factions inside Syria fighting Assad and Isis, including the Kurdish YPG. But diplomats supportive of the HNC say all the moderate Syrian fighting forceshave been consulted and agree with document. It is also expected that at Wednesday’s meeting, the Turkish foreign minister will call for international support for a no-fly zone in northern Syria. Turkey’s offensive into northern Syria has driven Isis militants from the last 55-mile (90km) strip of border territory that they controlled. The country now wants international support for a deeper operation to take control of a rectangle of territory stretching about 25 miles into Syria – a buffer between two Kurdish-held cantons to the east and west and against Isis to the south.

Given the question: If energy enters organisms and their habitat in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds, then what does energy enter in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds? Answer choices: - Generating heat - volume - colors of the spectrum - organisms and their habitat - density - Transfers energy - gravity - it helps plants in growing The answer is:","completion":"Organisms and their habitat, and it helps plants in growing. Energy entering organisms and their habitat in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds is a fundamental aspect of life on Earth. The primary source of energy for most organisms and their habitats is sunlight, which is transformed into usable energy through the process of photosynthesis. Chemical compounds can also provide energy, particularly in the case of chemosynthetic bacteria that live in extreme environments, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Sunlight, which consists of various colors in the visible spectrum, is essential for the growth and survival of autotrophic organisms, such as plants, algae, and some bacteria. Photosynthetic organisms, or autotrophs, capture light energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy via photosynthesis. This chemical energy is stored in the form of glucose, which can be used for growth, reproduction, and other essential life processes. In the process of photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is absorbed by chlorophyll, a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells and photosynthetic bacteria. This light energy is then used to split water molecules into their constituent components – oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is released as a waste product, while the hydrogen is used to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into glucose through a series of chemical reactions known as the Calvin cycle. This glucose can then be used by other organisms in the habitat, such as herbivores, who consume the photosynthetic organisms as a source of food. This energy transfer continues up the food chain, as predators eat herbivores, and so on, forming a web of interconnected organisms that make up a functioning ecosystem. This process ultimately enables the efficient utilization and transfer of energy within the habitat, supporting a diverse range of life. Chemical compounds can also serve as energy sources for certain organisms, as in the case of chemosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria are capable of obtaining energy from the oxidation of inorganic chemical compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, found in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. In these environments, sunlight is inaccessible, and the bacteria must rely on these chemical compounds to generate energy. This energy is then used to fix carbon dioxide into glucose, supplying other organisms in these unique ecosystems with a source of energy. In summary, energy enters organisms and their habitat in the form of sunlight and chemical compounds, playing a crucial role in the growth and survival of both autotrophic and heterotrophic life forms. This energy is transformed and utilized in various ways, ultimately supporting the complex web of life that constitutes a thriving and diverse ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Wearing black T-shirts and yellow ribbons, the symbols of the city's democracy movement, they have taken to the streets in response to a decision by the senior Chinese leadership to set out clear limits on who can run for the position of chief executive, Hong Kong's top leader, in 2017. The rules make it virtually impossible for anyone not trusted by the Chinese government to stand for election. As a result, the protesters accuse Beijing of reneging on decades of vows to give Hong Kong people genuine democracy. But although there is widespread anger that Beijing may have violated the spirit of the agreements it has made, there is intense debate over whether it has violated the letter of the law. Alan Hoo, a top barrister and expert on the Basic Law, the city constitution, told BBC News that China had not broken any promises. \\"I think that its position is grossly misunderstood,\\" he says. \\"Firstly, it's not a promise. It is a legal obligation, a constitutional obligation that they put in the Basic Law.\\" Mr Hoo, chairman of the Basic Law Institute and a well-known pro-Beijing figure in Hong Kong, is referring to Article 45 of the Basic Law, which refers specifically to one person, one vote. \\"The ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures,\\" it says. It is Beijing's conservative interpretation of that line that has brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets. According to the rules announced at the end of August by the Standing Committee of China's parliament, candidates for chief executive must gain the support of a majority of a nominating committee. There can be only two to three candidates. CY Leung, the current chief executive, has further clarified that the nominating committee will be modelled on the existing election committee - composed of members largely loyal to Beijing - that selected him in 2012. \\"The people on the streets are asking for the right to nominate,\\" says Mr Hoo. \\"Universal suffrage, under the international covenant, means that there are express rights to elect or be elected. There is no express right to nominate.\\" This argument is disputed by those, including the former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten, who accuse the Chinese government of refusing to live up to its commitments by hiding behind flexible legal language. Years before the then British colony was returned to China in 1997, a number of senior Chinese leaders had assured the Hong Kong public that one person, one vote would be in its future. In a comment in the official People's Daily newspaper in March 1993, Lu Ping, then the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said: \\"How Hong Kong develops its democracy in the future is entirely within the autonomy of Hong Kong.\\" And in a letter written in May 1984, then Premier Zhao Ziyang promised university students in Hong Kong that protecting the people's democratic rights was a basic principle of the government. He assured them that there would, someday, be democratic rule in Hong Kong. But just five years later, Mr Zhao, a relatively liberal-minded leader, would be punished for siding with the student demonstrators on Tiananmen Square, spending the rest of his life under house arrest. Emily Lau, chairwoman of the city's Democratic Party, believes those previous promises should still be honoured. She says universal suffrage should mean voters be given a choice of candidates from different political persuasions. North Korea and Iran also have one person, one vote, she says, but a sharply restricted list of candidates. \\"Are we going to be like Iran or North Korea?\\" she asks. \\"No, we are Hong Kong. We want to go by international standards and give voters a genuine choice.\\" The demonstrators say that, for the crowds to recede, the Hong Kong and Chinese governments must listen to the voices of the people. They argue that the general public are, at heart, pragmatic people who understand they are ultimately Chinese citizens. Ms Lau adds: \\"Whoever is elected by the Hong Kong people to be chief executive, I am quite sure that person would love China and love Hong Kong and would be able to defend the interest of the Hong Kong people and would also be able to work with Beijing. \\"Such people exist. Just give us some space, so that they can be nominated. And allow the people to elect.\\" Q&A: Hong Kong's democracy controversy What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The ongoing debate over Hong Kong's democracy and its future elections revolves around the interpretation of the city's Basic Law, specifically Article 45. Beijing has set rules for the selection of Hong Kong's chief executive that prioritize candidates trusted by the Chinese government, which has ignited protests and accusations that China is not allowing genuine democracy in the city. Pro-Beijing figures argue that the ultimate goal according to the Basic Law is \\"selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee.\\" These individuals claim that Beijing's rules do not break any promises. However, critics, such as the city's Democratic Party, contend that a genuinely democratic election would allow voters a choice of candidates from different political persuasions and see Beijing's interpretation as restrictive and a betrayal of previous promises made by Chinese leaders. As a result, disagreements surrounding the interpretation of Basic Law persist, with continuous protests calling for the Hong Kong and Chinese governments to listen to the voices of the people and provide a democratic electoral process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which changes less frequently, term A or term B? David was interested in climate change issues. He realized that to understand climate change issues he first needed to distinguish between the terms weather and climate. To that end, he labeled weather as term A. Then he labeled climate as term B. He found it easier to understand their differences in that way. Hint: Weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.

Climate refers to the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. Based on the information provided, we can infer that weather (term A) changes more frequently since it refers to daily changes in temperature and precipitation. On the other hand, climate (term B) represents the average conditions over longer periods, which means it changes less frequently. So, term B (climate) changes less frequently than term A (weather)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer. Problem:Context_1 : Brancaster Manor is a saltmarsh owned by the National Trust near Brancaster, Norfolk covering 810 ha (2,000 acres). It was originally purchased by the Brancaster Memorial Trust in 1964, and transferred to the National Trust in 1967. It is leased to Brancaster Staithe Fishermen's Society. Context_2 : High Crag stands at the southern end of the High Stile ridge which divides the valleys of Ennerdale and Buttermere in the west of the English Lake District. It is often climbed as part of a popular ridge walk, from Black Sail youth hostel, or from Buttermere via Scarth Gap. Panoramas of the Great Gable and the Scafells are visible. Context_3 : A national trust is an organisation dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of a particular geographic region. Although the focus of a national trust may vary by region, the principal role is to ensure the preservation of historically significant items, and to conserve areas of natural beauty. National trusts generally operate as private non-profit organizations. The first such trust organisation, The Trustees of Reservations, originated in 1890 as a regional group serving the state of Massachusetts, USA. The first national trust, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, was founded in England in 1895 and operates as a charitable organisation serving England, Wales and Northern Ireland (it is commonly known in the UK as the National Trust). Other national trusts have since been set up around the world. Context_4 : Moss Eccles Tarn is a tarn on Claife Heights, near Near Sawrey in the Lake District, Cumbria. It is currently owned by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty and known as an attractive tarn for fishing and walking. It is known for its association with Beatrix Potter – she owned the tarn and donated it to the National Trust after her death, and it served as inspiration for some of her stories. Context_5 : Malham Tarn is a glacial lake near the village of Malham in the Yorkshire Dales, England. The lake is one of only eight upland alkaline lakes in Europe. At an altitude of 377 m above sea level it is the highest marl lake in the United Kingdom. Its geology, flora and fauna have led to it being listed under a number of conservation designations. The site is currently owned by the National Trust, who lease part of the site to the Field Studies Council who offer residential and non-residential field courses there. The site was the inspiration for Charles Kingsley's 1863 novel, \\"The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby\\". Context_6 : The National Trust Company was incorporated on August 12, 1898 under the name of The National Trust Company of Ontario Limited. In 1899, with the opening of an office in Montreal, the name was changed to The National Trust Company, Limited. In 1984, National Trust amalgamated with The Victoria & Grey Trust Company and the company once again changed its name, this time to The National Victoria & Grey Trust Company. Because the name was deemed too cumbersome, however, it was subsequently changed to the National Trust Company on June 3, 1985. On August 14, 1997, Scotiabank purchased the National Trust Company. Context_7 : Buttermere is a lake in the English Lake District in North West England. The adjacent village of Buttermere takes its name from the lake. Historically in Cumberland, the lake is now within the county of Cumbria. It is owned by the National Trust, forming part of their Buttermere and Ennerdale property. Context_8 : Below is a list of the stately homes, historic houses, castles, abbeys, museums, estates, coastline and open country in the care of the National Trust in Wales, grouped into the unitary authority areas. Many areas of land owned by the trust, both open-access and closed to the public, are not listed here. This is a list of the more notable sites, generally defined as those having either an entry in the National Trust handbook, or a page on their website. There are many other areas of moorland and open country, agricultural holdings and coastline belonging to the National Trust, that are not listed here. Context_9 : National Trust Magazine is the members’ publication of National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. With a readership of over 4 million (ABC 2,165,142) it currently has the highest magazine circulation in Britain. Three issues are sent out every year - spring, summer and autumn – and are delivered as part of the National Trust members’ mailout, which includes local newsletters and other information for Trust members. Context_10 : The National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), (राष्ट्रिय प्रकृति संरक्षण कोष) previously known as King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation is a Nepalese non-governmental organization working in the field of nature conservation.It was established in 1982 as an autonomous non profit organization by legislative law of Nepal. NTNC's mission is to conserve nature and natural resources in Nepal while meeting the needs of the people in sustainable way. Geographically, the Trust activities have spread from the sub-tropical plains of Chitwan, Bardia and Kanchanpur in the lowlands to the Annapurna and Manaslu region of the high Himalayas, including the trans-Himalayan region of Upper Mustang and Manang. Currently, the projects of Trust are divided into three geographical areas - the lowland, the mid-hills (Kathmandu Valley) and the high mountains. The Trust’s activities in the lowlands are based in and around the Chitwan National Park, the Bardia National Park and the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve located in the central, western and far-western development regions of Nepal, through the Biodiversity Conservation Center (BCC) in Chitwan, the Bardia Conservation Program (BCP) in Bardia and the Suklaphanta Conservation Program (SCP) in Kanchanpur. Similarly, the Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP), the Manaslu Conservation Area Project (MCAP) and Gaurishankar Conservation Area Project (GCAP) are three protected areas managed by the Trust in the mountain region. The Central Zoo is the only project of the Trust in Kathmandu Valley. As a new initiative, the Trust has established an Energy and Climate Change Unit to address the emerging issues of climate change through mitigation and adaptation approach and renewable energy technologies. The Trust has also started work on urban environment conservation with the Bagmati River Conservation Project. fact_1 : High Crag stands at the southern end of the High Stile ridge which divides the valleys of Ennerdale and Buttermere in the west of the English Lake District. fact_2 : It is owned by the National Trust, forming part of their Buttermere and Ennerdale property.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Without doubt. Does it follow that \\"Impossible!\\"?","completion":"To answer whether \\"Impossible!\\" follows the statement \\"Without doubt,\\" we must first examine the context and meaning of both phrases. \\"Without doubt\\" is an expression that implies certainty or confidence in the statement preceding or following it. It means that the speaker strongly believes that something is true or that a certain event will occur. \\"Impossible!\\" typically refers to something that cannot happen or be done, either due to its inherent nature or given the current circumstances. It expresses disbelief in the mentioned situation or outcome. Now, let's assume that these two phrases are connected and examine whether it follows that \\"Impossible!\\" comes after \\"Without doubt.\\" 1. If the context refers to the certainty of the impossibility of something: Example: \\"Without doubt, it's impossible for humans to breathe underwater without any assistance.\\" In this case, \\"Impossible!\\" does follow the statement \\"Without doubt,\\" because the speaker is confident in their assertion that humans can't breathe underwater unaided. 2. If the context refers to opposing viewpoints: Example: Person A: \\"I believe, without doubt, that this project will succeed.\\" Person B: \\"Impossible! We don't have enough funding or resources.\\" Here, \\"Impossible!\\" does follow the statement \\"Without doubt,\\" but it represents a disagreement and contrasting views between two individuals. Person A is confident about the project's success, while Person B disputes this notion due to their belief in the lack of funding and resources. 3. If the context refers to the impossibility of having absolute certainty: Example: \\"Without doubt, every scientific theory is subject to change with new evidence. That being said, it's impossible to claim any theory as irrefutable truth.\\" In this case, \\"Impossible!\\" follows \\"Without doubt\\" because the main point revolves around the idea that absolute certainty cannot be achieved due to the ever-evolving nature of scientific knowledge. Based on these examples, we can conclude that \\"Impossible!\\" can follow \\"Without doubt\\" depending on the context they are presented in. Sometimes the connection makes sense, as in example 1, where confidence in the impossibility of an event is being expressed. In other cases, like example 2, \\"Impossible!\\" serves to counter the certainty expressed in \\"Without doubt.\\" Finally, in example 3, both phrases work together to express the inherent uncertainty of certain subjects, like scientific theories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It happened while her family was headed home from Disney World. Her mom still cannot believe it. \\"It's just not right,\\" said Donna Beegle. Juliette was diagnosed with autism at 3 years old. She can get intensely frustrated because she cannot communicate well. After refusing to eat dinner on their layover in Houston, or any of the snacks mom Donna always packs just in case, Juliette started to wail and yell out. “Really I saw it as a threat to the airline and the flight attendants to say, 'Well if we don't get this, this is what's going to happen.'” Fellow passenger Justin Alderman \\"I knew, 'This kid needs to eat,' because I know her and I'm seeing the symptoms going, 'OK, I need to get her something.' So I'm offering her what I have and none of it works.\\" Flight attendants brought her a cold sandwich, but her mom explained to the flight crew that Juliette has autism, and wants to only eat hot food. She says the flight attendant told her only first class passengers get hot food. \\"Finally I got frustrated and I said, you know, 'We'll wait. She's going to get upset, start crying. She's going to have a meltdown and then you'll want to help her,'\\" Beegle said. \\"She lashes out and scratches,\\" said Juliette's dad, Chuck Forbes. Justin Alderman of Salem was 10 rows up and heard all the commotion. \\"Really I saw it as a threat to the airline and the flight attendants to say, 'Well if we don't get this, this is what's going to happen,'\\" Alderman recounted. The flight crew finally brought a hot meal from first class, and Juliette calmed down. But shortly after, the pilot announced they were making an emergency landing in Salt Lake City to drop off an \\"unruly passenger.\\" The family was escorted off the plane. \\"I stood up and said, 'Is there anyone here that's afraid of my 15-year-old Juliette, who has autism?' And people were like, 'No, leave her alone.' I'm sorry. Passengers were awesome,\\" Beegle said. But the perspective from some other passengers was different. \\"The family may not like it and feel like it's embarrassing them,\\" Alderman said. \\"But ultimately I think the decision was made more for them than the passengers on board.\\" \\"As a mom it ripped my heart out,\\" said Beegle. \\"I was shaking.\\" United Airlines is defending its decision to make the emergency landing. \\"After working to accommodate Dr. Beegle and her daughter during the flight, the crew made the best decision for the safety and comfort of all of our customers and elected to divert to Salt Lake City after the situation became disruptive,\\" said United spokeswoman Karen May. \\"We rebooked the customers on a different carrier and the flight continued to Portland.\\" Beegle filed a complaint with United and the FAA. She said she plans to file a lawsuit in the near future. \\"My goal is training,\\" said Beegle. \\"They need training.\\" Read or Share this story: http://on.kgw.com/1H7Tgb9 ||||| TIGARD, Ore. (KOIN) — Donna Beegle, her husband and their son and daughter were headed back to Portland on Tuesday after spending a few days at DisneyWorld in Orlando. They flew from Orlando to Houston, with a connecting flight from Houston to Portland on United Airlines Flight 1535. About an hour into the flight to Portland, she noticed a tell-tale sign from her daughter. “She started getting a little upset and I started thinking, ‘You know what? She didn’t eat her dinner,” Donna Beegle told KOIN 6 News. “I know her, when she gets overhungry or overthirsty, she really struggles because she can’t tell us and she gets really frustrated.” Juliette, a 15-year-old sophomore at Tigard High School, has autism. Beegle said they’ve become very good at anticipating what Juliette needs and how she’ll react to certain things. She said her daughter is “extremely picky” about what she eats, and she asked if there was a hot meal she could buy from the first-class section of the flight. At first, she was told no, she said, and then explained her daughter’s needs. “He said, ‘No, I can’t make an exception.'” Beegle told KOIN 6 News she explained that if her daughter didn’t get a hot meal, she would “get to the meltdown point” and maybe scratch someone. Juliette soon got a first-class meal. Emergency landing Soon, she said, Juliette – sitting in a window seat – was calm and watching a video when a cabin announcement told passengers the plane was making an emergency landing in Salt Lake City due to a passenger “in the back of the plane who has behavior issues.” Paramedics came on board and eventually made their way to where the Beegles were sitting. They asked if everything was fine, and the Beegles said yes. “They could see Juliette was sitting there watching her show,” she said. Video taken by passenger Chris Hall and provided to KOIN 6 News: Beegle said the paramedics alerted them they may be asked to leave the plane. Soon, police arrived and told the family they had to leave. “It was completely bizarre,” she told KOIN 6 News. She realized they were being asked to leave the plane “because of the fear of autism.” Police told her the captain was not comfortable flying to Portland with Juliette on the plane, she said. That’s when Beegle said she stood up and asked if anyone on the plane felt threatened by the teen. “The people were, like, ‘No, leave her alone.'” She demanded the police officer take statements from the other passengers. “He said, ‘You have a lot of people on your side saying this was not an issue.'” United Airlines statement In a statement to KOIN 6 News, United Airlines spokeswoman Jennifer Dohm said, “After working to accommodate Dr. Beegle and her daughter during the flight, the crew made the best decision for the safety and comfort of all of our customers and elected to divert to Salt Lake City after the situation became disruptive. We rebooked the customers on a different carrier and the flight continued to Portland.” The Beegles boarded a Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Portland. Filing suit “I get the ignorance,” Beegle said. “But it has to change.” She decided to contact the media and she’s hired an attorney. “It’s not about the money, it’s about the training” people need, she said, and added 1 in 68 children face autism. She’s filing a lawsuit “so no one else has to go through this.” Donna Beegle said her daughter is a treasure. “Every day we learn things from her.” This slideshow requires JavaScript. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A family was removed from a United Airlines flight after their 15-year-old autistic daughter became agitated when there was no hot food available for her.

Context: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Usain St Leo Bolt (; born 21 August 1986) is a retired Jamaican sprinter and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 x 100 metres relay. His reign as Olympic Games champion in all of these events spans multiple Olympics. Due to his achievements and dominance in sprint competition, he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time. Performing for Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the 400 metres in the 2001 CARIFTA Games, winning a silver medal. The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s. He made his first appearance on the world stage at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s. Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident. However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships. Bolt is one of only nine athletes (along with Valerie Adams, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Jacques Freitag, Yelena Isinbayeva, Jana Pittman, Dani Samuels, David Storl, and Kirani James) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event. Former Prime Minister P. J. Patterson recognised Bolt's talent and arranged for him to move to Kingston, along with Jermaine Gonzales, so he could train with the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) at the University of Technology, Jamaica. Did he have other career highlights?","completion":"Yes, Usain Bolt, born on 21st August 1986, had numerous illustrious career highlights. One of the most decorated sprinters in history, Bolt holds the world record in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 x 100 metres relay stints. His reign as Olympic Games champion in these categories has spanned across multiple Olympics, validating his reputation as the greatest sprinter of all time. Bolt's prodigious talent was first evident during his initial Caribbean regional event when he clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the 400 metres track at the 2001 CARIFTA Games. He didn't just stop with a silver medal; he also secured silver in the 200 m category, finishing in 21.81 s. His first global appearance was at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Despite not qualifying for the finals in the 200 m event, he indeed carved a new personal best of 21.73 s. Nevertheless, his relentless spirit and sheer speed propelled his journey forward, notably at the CARIFTA Games, where he set astounding championship records in the 200 m and 400 m races with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He further established records at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships with finishes of 20.61 s and 47.12 s. Bolt's records don't stop at the regional level. He is also one of only nine athletes, including the likes of Valerie Adams, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Jacques Freitag, Yelena Isinbayeva, Jana Pittman, Dani Samuels, David Storl, and Kirani James, who were fortunate enough to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior levels of an athletic event. In spite of his light-hearted and jovial demeanor, Bolt's extraordinary talent was revered professionally. Recognizing his exceptional abilities, former Prime Minister P. J. Patterson arranged for Bolt to move to Kingston with compatriot Jermaine Gonzales. There, he trained with the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) at the University of Technology, Jamaica. This collective body of work and numerous recognitions, not only highlight his career but also cement Bolt's place as one of the greatest athletes to have ever graced the world of sprinting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not long after his tenth birthday Peter was entrusted to take her to school. It was only two stops down the road , but the way his parents kept going on about it , you might have thought Peter was taking Kate to the North Pole . He was given instructions the night before. When he woke up , he had to listen to them over and over again. He was to keep hold of Kate's hand at all times , sit close to the front nearest the window , and tell the bus driver the name of his stop. Peter repeated all this back to his mother and set out for the bus stop with his sister. They held hands all the way. Actually he didn't mind this but simply hoped that none of his friends would see him holding a girl's hand. The bus came. They got on and sat close to the front. It was ridiculous sitting there holding hands and there were some boys from school there, so they let go of each other. Peter was feeling proud of himself. He could take care of his sister anywhere. If they were alone tighter on a mountain pass and came face to face with a pack of hungry wolves, he could know exactly what to do. Taking care and not to make sudden movement, he would move away with Kate until they had their backs to a large rock. That way the wolves would not be able to surround them. Then he takes from his pocket two important things--his hunting knife and a box of matches. He takes the knife from its sheath and sets it down on the grass, ready in case the wolves attack. They're coming close now. They're so hungry and are watering and growling . Kate is crying, but he cannot comfort her. He knows he has to concentrate on his plan. Right at their feet are some dry leaves and twigs. Quickly and skillfully, Peter gathers them into a small pile. The wolves are edging closer. He has to get this right. There's only one match left in the box. He bends down, cups his hand and lights the match. There's strong rush of wind. The flame flickers, but Peter holds it close to the pile and then first one leaf, then another, then the end of a twig catch fire, and soon the little pile is burning. He piles on more leaves and twigs and larger sticks. The wolves are backing off. Wild animals are terrified of fire. The flames are leaping higher and the wind is carrying the smoke right into their jaws. Now Peter takes holds of the hunting knife and ... Ridiculous! A daydream like this could make him miss his stop if he wasn't careful. The bus had come to a halt. The kids from his school were already getting off. Peter leaped to his feet and just managed to jump to the pavement as the bus was starting off again. It was more than fifty yards down the road when he realized he had forgotten something. Was it his backpack ? No. It was his sister. He had saved her from the wolves and left her sitting there. For a moment, he couldn't move.

Write a title for this article: (CNN) - Sarah Palin has been delivering campaign-style speeches in recent days – still leaving open whether she will actually run for the Republican presidential nomination. For now, she seems to want the best of all worlds: She teases a presidential run while still maintaining her millions of dollars in income from her paid speeches, books, reality TV shows and Fox News. She no doubt also loves all the attention. In her latest speech before the Tea Party Express in New Hampshire, she certainly hit all the major points the tea party movement wants to hear: smaller government, lower taxes, reduced federal regulations. But she spoke only in generalities without getting into any specifics as to how she would achieve those objectives. I heard a lot of politically popular clichés. She blasted President Obama for giving good speeches but never backing them up with substance. But at least on this day, she did exactly that herself – she gave a good speech but didn’t back it up with substance. She said the private sector always does everything better than the government can, and she was applauded. But I suspect those same people who clapped in approval don’t want the private sector to take over their Social Security and Medicare benefits. I also suspect they don’t want to privatize the United States military. Those are all government-run operations. Palin also avoided discussing certain sensitive subjects in her New Hampshire address. There was no mention of the social issues, including abortion rights for women or gay rights. Except for praising the men and women in the armed forces, there was no discussion of national security, including the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was a speech designed to deliver some red meat to the tea party movement, which is fine if you’re running for the presidential nomination and seeking votes. But as you can tell, I was hoping for more than simply railing against “the permanent political class” and “crony capitalism.” But I will say this: To her credit, she can deliver a good stump speech. And she doesn’t need a teleprompter. By the way, I have no idea whether she will run. I suppose this guessing game will continue for a few more weeks.

Write a title for this article: Some people thrive on data, and like to measure, quantify, classify and graph. For obvious reasons, these people tend to gravitate toward fields like programming and engineering--fields that require a lot of sitting in front of a computer and not getting much exercise. In other words, there's a lot of fat nerds out there. Fortunately, there's also the Fitbit. Last fall, San Francisco-based startup Fitbit launched its namesake product, the Fitbit Tracker. It's a small plastic gizmo containing a 3-D motion sensor, something like what's inside a Nintendo ( NTDOY.PK - news - people ) Wii controller. Clip it onto your clothing, and it logs your movements throughout the day. It may sound like just a fancy (and at 99, expensive) pedometer. But the high-tech Fitbit is much more. Because it follows your movements in three dimensions, it doesn't just count steps--it knows how much you've been exerting yourself, if you've been sitting, walking or running. It also knows when you did what, so it can tell the difference between someone who is constantly on his feet, vs. an otherwise sedentary person who takes one long walk at the end of the day. Fitbit even wants to track you when you're not moving at all. Strap the gadget into the included wrist band and wear it while you sleep; the tracker can tell when you wake up, or toss and turn, providing insight into the quality of your rest. Better yet, the Fitbit comes with a base station that plugs into your computer, and communicates wirelessly with the tracker. So all the information about your day's activities is automatically and seamlessly uploaded to Fitbit's secure servers, allowing you to log on to their Web site and view all kinds of graphs, data and details about your active habits. Fitbit also allows users to log their meals into the Fitbit Dashboard Web portal, so the result is a robust, one-stop control center to keep track of your diet, fitness and health. I've been using the Fitbit for several months now, and I'm impressed. It's made me much more aware of how active I am over the course of a day, and helped me get up out of my chair more often and for longer periods. Dare I say it? It's made me healthier. Fitness experts say you should take at least 10,000 steps in a given day. Most of us don't come even close to that. But the best thing about the Fitbit is being able to know exactly how close you came to a goal--and to turn achieving it into something of a game. I have definitely found myself walking more, skipping subway stops or taking an extra loop around the block, just because I knew it would add to my daily total, and perhaps put me over the 10,000 step mark. The ability to track your diet alongside your exercise is also particularly useful. If you're trying to lose weight, it's helpful to know how many calories you've taken in and how many you've expended; the Fitbit Dashboard does an excellent job showing if you're under or over your goals.","completion":"Title: \\"Fitbit Tracker: The High-Tech Gadget Turning Data-Lovers into Fitness Enthusiasts\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In general, a person's diet may have some indirect effects on pollution in natural water sources, though the connection is not immediate or strong. If a person is dieting and they choose to consume more organic, locally produced foods, and reduce their consumption of processed and packaged products, this behavior could contribute to less pollution entering natural water sources. This is because organic farming practices use fewer synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and eco-friendly packaging generates less waste. Moreover, if multiple individuals adopt similar dieting habits and make conscious efforts to reduce their environmental impact, it could result in a collective reduction in pollution. However, the direct effect of a single individual's diet on the pollution entering water sources is minimal and would not notably improve the overall situation.

Maurice Robert \\"Mike\\" Gravel (; born May 13, 1930) is an American politician who was a Democratic United States Senator from Alaska from 1969 to 1981 and a candidate in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, by French-Canadian immigrant parents, Gravel served in the U.S. Army in West Germany, and he later graduated from the Columbia University School of General Studies. He moved to Alaska in the late 1950s, becoming a real estate developer and entering politics. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966 and also became Speaker of the Alaska House. Gravel \\"decided to become a pioneer in a faraway place,\\" and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in August 1956, without funds or a job, looking for a place where someone without social or political connections could be a viable candidate for public office. Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, played a role in his decision, as did its newness and cooler climate. Broke when he arrived, he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived. Gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, working the snow-clearing train on the Anchorage-Fairbanks run. Subsequently, he opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage (the Territory of Alaska not requiring a license) and saved enough so as not to have to work the railroad again. Gravel joined the Anchorage Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, and continued a sporadic relationship with the movement throughout his life. Gravel married Rita Jeannette Martin, who had been Anchorage's \\"Miss Fur Rendezvous\\" of 1958, on April 29, 1959. They had two children, Martin Anthony Gravel and Lynne Denise Gravel, born c. 1960 and 1962 respectively. Meanwhile, he went to Washington, D.C. in 1957 to campaign for Alaskan statehood via the \\"Tennessee Plan\\": dressed as Paul Revere, he rode with a petition to the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Seeing Alaska as a wide-open place with no political establishment or entrenched interests, and using the slogan \\"Gravel, the Roadbed to Prosperity\\", he ran for the territorial legislature in 1958 but lost. He went on a national speaking tour concerning tax reform in 1959, sponsored by the Jaycees. He ran without avail for the City Council in Anchorage in 1960. During this time, he had become a successful real estate agent; after the 1960 election, he became a property developer in a mobile home park on the outskirts of Anchorage. A partner ran into financial difficulty, however, and the project went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Gravel was forced out in 1962.","completion":"This text is about Maurice Robert \\"Mike\\" Gravel, an American politician who was a Democratic United States Senator from Alaska and a candidate in the 2008 U.S. presidential election."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Alexander Hood was an officer of what naval warfare force that has origins in the early 16th century?

Aim for foods high in protein, like eggs, tofu, yogurt, or peanut butter. Or choose nutrient-rich food options like oatmeal and fresh fruit. These foods will fuel your body through the day and give you the energy you need to stay awake and active. Caffeinated beverages can help you combat sleepiness and make you feel more wakeful and energetic. And drinking coffee or tea can bring plenty of health benefits, too. These naturally caffeinated beverages are chock full of antioxidants, and recent studies suggest that drinking coffee can even decrease your risk of developing depression. Don't drink too much! Excessive caffeine consumption can cause anxiousness and irritability. Drinking too much coffee can also interfere with your ability to have a good night of sleep after you make it through the day. Opt for coffee over energy drinks. An 8 oz. cup of coffee typically contains more caffeine than the same serving size of most energy drinks. Drinking enough water is important to maintain your body's natural functions, and dehydration can actually make you feel even more tired. The physical act of chewing keeps your body awake, and ice comes with the additional benefits of being refreshing and hydrating. Snacks high in protein and vitamins, like nuts or fresh fruit, can help give you an energy boost between meals when your body starts to drag. Even just a brief 15-20 minute nap can boost your energy levels and leave you feeling more alert, awake, and able to perform at work. Don't nap for too long. Napping for more than 30 minutes can lead to increased grogginess after waking. Remember that you may feel groggy for about 15 minutes after waking. It might be a good idea to drink coffee immediately after a nap. Your body needs most of its calories in the morning and afternoon. Give yourself the fuel you need when you need it most.

Hisamasa 's retainers had enough and after his son Azai Nagamasa won the Battle of Norada against a force at least twice the size of his led by Rokkaku Yoshikata to win back independence , they forced Hisamasa into retirement . Yet , this retirement was not complete and Hisamasa managed to hold some sway of the clan . This surfaced in 1570 after Oda Nobunaga who was allied with his son , Azai Nagamasa , attacked Asakura Yoshikage who had supported Hisamasa against enemies like the Rokkaku clan . Hating Nobunaga for his personality , Hisamasa demanded that the Azai clan pay back the support of Asakura clan and forced a war by breaking the alliance . It is thought that Nagamasa opposed him and believed that the alliance could somehow be mended over time since he refused to divorce his wife , Oichi , but he failed to gain enough support to overturn Hisamasa .

In most of this period, the shoguns were the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the country; although nominally they were appointed by the Emperor as a ceremonial formality.

Listen, I didn't expect much from a room under 50 bucks but...come on man! Everything was cheaply okay until the man in the lobby, Andy, who was nice, made a bad excuse for the joint. I questioned my address on the bill to which he explained that it was the address for Expedia, since the reservation was made via Expedia. Andy went on to tell me, \\"Do you know how much Expedia paid for the room.\\" \\"Doesn't really matter to me\\" I said. \\"39. The rest is fees you pat them.\\" He told me anyway. \\"This is why I have to give you the room you get.\\" He went on. \\"Okay.\\" I said and now wondered what he meant by that. I get to the room which is the first one next to the lobby. It must have been a storage closet before. LOL. No, really, I laughed out loud and said really?! The room was just big enough to crush the queen size bed into it with a miscellaneous door on the side wall blocked by a long useless table. There was also a round table and chair between the bed and the bathroom and a bedside table. Why all the table is beyond me. The bathroom was fine with a small shower. The decor was 20+ years out dated and the smell was musty and that goes for the pillow cases too. BUT...here's the kicker. It's 2013 and the TV was from 1982 at best. No lie. No joke. I had to bang it to get a picture on the little 20 inch screen. I'm surprised it wasn't black and white. ...and Andy. It's not because of Expedia that the room is as it is. It simply because someone is too CHEAP to upgrade this establishment to 50 a night worthiness. Howard Johnson would NOT be proud.

Today we are going to talk about how President Barack Obama and his team look at two important things: health care and climate change. You know that health care means taking care of ourselves when we are sick, and climate change is about protecting our planet Earth from getting too hot or too cold. Now, there is a thing called a \\"law\\" which tells people what they can and cannot do. President Obama has a health care law which helps people to be taken care of when they are sick, so they can feel better. But some people think that the words in this law should be taken very seriously, exactly the way they are written. However, President Obama's team thinks that the best way to understand this law is not to take every word literally. Instead, we should look at what the law wants to do, which is to help sick people. On the other hand, President Obama also cares about our planet Earth. He wants to make sure that it stays healthy so that we can all live here happily. To do this, he is using an old law, which was written a long time ago, to control the air pollution that can hurt our Earth. This time, he wants the judges, who are people that help decide if a law is being followed, to read the law in a very serious way, just like it is written.

So, for health care, President Obama's team thinks that the best way to understand the law is not to take every word seriously, while on climate change, the president wants the judges to read the law exactly the way it is.

I work know security and one night at around 2am I walked in the bathroom because a customer complained about a man yelling in the bathroom. I told my partner I would go check it out by myself so he could stay and keep quality control of who comes in the venue. I walk in and in the first cubicle I could see lots and lots of blood on the floor and a pair of feet placed as if he was sitting down. I quickly go to the next cubicle asking at the same time if the person was OK obviously with no response. I look over and it was a horrible bloody mess. I quickly get on the radio and tell my partner to call police and ambulance and to put the place on lock down. I walk around to the from of the cubicle and kick open the door. The man had grabbed a straight razor and cut his arms extremely deep from the wrist downwards all the way to his elbow palms up. On both arms mind you. A good example of what it would look like would be the scene from the terminator 2 where Arnold cuts the skin off from his arm. The ambulance came and had to call another team to collect the body. The building was closed for around a day and a half they had to repaint and do all sorts of things because of so much blood. Ill say they do not train you for seeing such horrible things or even mention that it can happen I'm lucky enough to have a strong head and can handle seeing such horror. Of course Im not 100% OK from it and now keep a close eye on the bathrooms. But I'm OK enough to continue working and only saw a psychologist twice about it.

Background: Ciara Princess Harris was born in Austin, Texas, on October 25, 1985, the only child of Jackie and Carlton Clay Harris. An army brat, she grew up in Germany, New York, Utah, California, Arizona and Nevada. Ciara's parents are both African Americans. Ciara also has some Irish ancestry, from her mother's background. Context: On December 5, 2006, Ciara released her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution. According to the singer, the title of the album is \\"about so much more than just my personal growth - it's about the evolution of music, the evolution of dance, the evolution of fashion.\\" The source of the album's creativity such as the sound and edge comes from Ciara in general. Ciara: The Evolution became Ciara's first number one album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and second on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts with sales of more than 338,000 becoming her highest first week of sales to date. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States, within only five weeks of its release, and has sold 1.3 million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. It sold over two million copies worldwide. The album's international lead single, \\"Get Up\\", which features Chamillionaire, reached number seven in the United States and gained a platinum accreditation. It reached number five in New Zealand. The song was used for the film Step Up (2006) and featured on the film's soundtrack. The album's US lead single, \\"Promise\\", reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her third number one single on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \\"Like a Boy\\" was released as the second international single which reached within the top twenty in the UK, Finland, France, Ireland, Sweden Switzerland, and also in the United States. The fourth and final single from the album, \\"Can't Leave 'em Alone\\", reached number 10 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song became Ciara's fifth single to peak in the top in New Zealand, peaking at number 4. The song achieved moderate success in other international markets. In support of the album, Ciara went on her first headlining tour in October 2006. The tour went to seventeen different clubs in cities throughout the United States. The tour was met with mixed to positive reviews; critics were divided regarding the pre-recorded backing tracks and remarked that Ciara was slightly under-prepared to host her own headlining tour, but ultimately praised her energetic choreography. In August 2007, she headlined the Screamfest '07 tour with fellow rapper, T.I.. Critics praised her performance for her gracious dancing and being able to command a sold out arena. Ciara, along with Chris Brown and Akon, was a support act for Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in the United Kingdom. She made a guest appearance on \\"So What\\" by Field Mob. The single went on to become a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. She also appeared on Tiffany Evans' single \\"Promise Ring\\". The song achieved little success on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In addition to her music, Ciara made her acting debut in the MTV Films production All You've Got in May 2006. In the movie she played Becca Whiley, a teenager who is competing in a volleyball tournament. The movie received mixed to positive reviews; critics said the movie was predictable but still enjoyable.

Answer the following question: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: What effect does the author probably believe that decluttering the house will have on it's market value? Options: - that it will improve the market value - that it will have no impact - the author has not given thought to market value - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The author probably believes that decluttering the house will have a positive impact on its market value. This can be inferred from the fact that the author mentions decluttering the home while it's on the market and packing up non-essential items to make the space appear clean and well-organized. A decluttered and organized home generally looks more spacious and attractive to potential buyers, which can improve its market value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article: Senate Democrats passed a plan Wednesday to extend current tax rates for all but the top income earners — a largely political vote on a critical policy issue that will dominate much of the end-of-year legislative session. The battle drilled down to whether to raise taxes for the rich – a resounding theme that has been central to President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign. Democrats want to extend tax rates for household income 250,000 and below for an additional year, while Republicans call for freezing all rates. Text Size - + reset The vote was 51-48 to pass the Democratic plan. Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Jim Webb (D-Va.) voted with the GOP to reject the proposal. The Republicans also got a vote on their plan to extend all the tax rates, which failed 45-54. The Democratic proposal, which had the White House’s backing, now heads to the Republican-led House, where it is dead on arrival. (Also on POLITICO: House OKs Ron Paul's 'audit the Fed' bill) “I’ve called on the House Republicans to drop their demands for another trillion-dollar giveaway for millionaires and billionaires so we can make sure the middle class families and small business have the financial security they need,” Obama said at a fundraiser at a House of Blues in New Orleans, La. “But so far, they don’t see it that way. Governor Romney doesn’t see it that way.” In a rare move in this oft-gridlocked Senate, leaders agreed to pass the plans with a simple majority vote, instead of requiring the chamber to break a 60-vote procedural barrier that has blocked much of the action in the Senate. Ramping up the legislative drama, Vice President Joe Biden showed up to preside over the Senate and be available to cast a tie-breaking vote — which ultimately wasn’t needed. Senate Republicans agreed to the simple-vote majority, believing that it would die in the House because of a constitutional issue requiring revenue measures to originate in the House, known on Capitol Hill as a “blue-slip” issue. “I learned that in the eighth grade,” said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), the minority whip. Moreover, they said, even with passage of the bill, allowing Democrats to vote on the merits of the plan gives them complete ownership of supporting a tax increase during a tough economy. And they wouldn’t be able to blame Republicans for filibustering. (Also on POLITICO: GOP push for stopgap resolution) “This puts people on the record on the merits of the bill, no procedural questions, so everybody’s constituents will know where everybody stands,” Kyl added. Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said: “It’s about time they quit hiding behind a stacked procedural setup in the Senate and have to take a vote on something. This is a clear vote: They voted for tax increases.” Still, there’s no denying that the vote gives Democrats new ammunition in the tax wars with the GOP, allowing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to later seek a conference committee with the House Republicans, something he said he’d be inclined to do. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Democrats mocked the GOP’s procedural concerns over the measure originating in the Senate. And they now claimed the upper hand ahead of the year-end fiscal fight where the two parties must resolve differences over the Bush tax cuts and automatic spending cuts or fall off what’s known as the “fiscal cliff.” “With this vote, he cannot point fingers back at the Senate,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said of House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). “He cannot hide behind technicalities. And he shouldn’t put blue slips before pay stubs.” And in a riff on Mitt Romney’s infamous dog incident, Murray added that Boehner can “either pass this bill, which delivers certainty to middle-class taxpayers and by the way is a tremendous step towards addressing sequestration. Or he can step on the gas, head towards that fiscal cliff and strap the American people – just like a dog we know – to the roof of his car.” ||||| Senate Democrats on Wednesday narrowly passed President Obama’s plan that would extend Bush-era tax rates for family income up to 250,000 a year. The surprising passage of the bill was a victory for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and the White House, though the highly contentious vote will undoubtedly be used by Republicans as political ammunition this election year. They ripped Democrats for seeking to raise taxes in an ailing economy. ADVERTISEMENT By a 51-48 tally, Democrats overcame two defections to win passage of the measure, which would also raise the top rate on capital gains and dividends, as well as continue several targeted tax provisions that Democrats say help the middle class. Earlier in the afternoon, the Senate turned aside a Republican proposal, by a mostly party-line vote of 45-54, that would have extended all current rates on income, capital gains, dividends and the estate tax, also for a year. Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Scott Brown (Mass.), voted against both plans, and Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) voted for the two proposals. Pryor is up for reelection in 2014. The dramatic roll calls came as Vice President Biden presided over the tally. He was in the chamber in case his vote, as president of the Senate, was needed to break a tie. Although the Republican bill was unlikely to pass the Senate and the Democratic bill faces grim prospects in the Republican-controlled House, leaders of both parties sought to send an election-year message on tax rates and display party unity. In the second roll call, Senate Democrats lost the votes of the two members of their caucus who had already indicated they would vote no — retiring Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Jim Webb (D-Va.). Lieberman said on the Senate floor that both the Republican and the Democratic plan amount to a punt at a time of trillion-dollar annual deficits. Webb, meanwhile, said that he would not support increasing taxes on ordinary income, but believed that rates for capital gains could go higher. But Democrats were able to hang on to votes from other potential fence-sitters, including Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), who both voted against a similar proposal in 2010. Manchin is up for reelection this fall, while Nelson is retiring. Nelson told reporters after the vote that it was a tough decision that wasn’t made any easier by the fact the vote is unlikely to go anywhere in the House. “We vote on a lot of things that are DOA in the House. The House votes on a lot of things that are DOA in the Senate,” Nelson said. “So that’s not the test.” Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), all of whom face potentially difficult reelection races in November or in 2014, also backed Obama’s proposal. The votes came following a topsy-turvy morning of legislative maneuvering in which Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) consented to allowing straight up-or-down votes on the two tax plans. The Senate had been scheduled to hold a procedural vote on just the Democratic plan, which would have needed 60 votes to advance. McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor, suggested his move was meant to smoke out vulnerable Democrats, and make them put their cards on the table. “The American people should know where we stand,” McConnell said. “Today they will.” Reid has said for weeks that he could muster a majority for the tax plan. The passage of the bill came after Democrats bickered over whether to raise the 250,000 threshold to 1 million annually. Obama refused to budge from his 250,000 mark, and congressional Democrats recently rallied behind their president, who is deadlocked in his reelection race with Mitt Romney. With Wednesday’s vote, a Democratic aide said, the chamber had upped the pressure on the House, with President Obama now being able to single out Republicans — and not just Congress — for not passing tax relief for the middle class. “Why don’t we pass this now, give real relief to the middle class, and have the other debate later?” Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, referring to the question of whether to extend the tax rates to income levels between 250,000 and 1 million. Schumer has previously embraced the higher threshold. Both Republicans and Democrats believe they have the upper hand on taxes, with 103 days to go before the election. Leaders of the respective parties are looking to win the message war this fall while also jockeying for leverage in advance of the post-election lame-duck session — when most of the substantive decisions on big-ticket tax and fiscal issues are expected to be made. For starters, measures that raise revenues are, under the Constitution, supposed to start in the House, and McConnell objected on Wednesday to a request from Reid to fix that issue. Democrats noted Wednesday that Republicans had allowed bills dealing with transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration to move forward, even though they could have been tripped up by the same problem. Regardless, the House is expected to hold its own vote next week on a measure that, similar to the Senate Republican bill, would essentially extend all Bush-era rates for a year. The House is expected to reject Obama’s plan while pushing for legislation to force a comprehensive revamp of the tax code in 2013. “Here in the House, where tax legislation originates under the Constitution, we’re going to vote to stop the tax hike,” Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement. “That much is clear.” Either way, Republicans and Democrats are expected to continue their broadsides, with each side accusing the other of holding tax relief hostage for political gain. “All sides agree on the need to extend the tax cuts for the middle class — this legislation reflects that consensus,” the Obama administration said in a policy statement. GOP lawmakers, meanwhile, have accused Democrats of seeking a tax hike on small businesses, and said that the current sluggish economy should convince policymakers not to raise anybody’s taxes at the end of the year. Republicans lambasted Democrats for leaving the estate tax out of their tax proposal, with the tax’s parameters scheduled to get much less generous at the end of the year. Senate Democrats had been calling to reinstate 2009 estate tax levels, which have also been endorsed by Obama. But with some Democrats suggesting they prefer the current estate tax policy, party leaders dropped the proposal from their plan. Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah), the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, and other GOP lawmakers have said that the Democrats’ decision could ensnare many more family farms and small businesses. But Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), citing polling on the issue, said that he thought Wednesday’s vote would be a boon to Democratic candidates in tough races, and that Republicans were on the wrong side of the issue. “Just take the phrase: ‘The top 2 percent of wage earners pay their fair share,’” Durbin said. “We’ve tested it in every direction. We know where people stand on it. They’re wrong, and they’ve been wrong.” — Updated at 9:08 p.m. ||||| Democrats pushed a yearlong extension of tax cuts for all but the highest-earning Americans through the Senate on Wednesday, giving Democrats a significant political victory on a measure that is fated to go no further in Congress. In this July 24, 2012, photo, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, talks to reporters following a closed-door political strategy session at the Capitol in Washington. The Senate is bracing for a tax-cut... (Associated Press) In this July 24, 2012, photo, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., gestures during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, following a political strategy session, as from back left,... (Associated Press) Senators approved the Democratic bill by a near party-line 51-48 vote, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding over the chamber in case his vote was needed to break a tie. Minutes earlier, lawmakers voted 54-45 to kill a rival Republican package that would have included the best-off in the tax reductions. The 250 billion Democratic measure would extend tax cuts in 2013 for millions of Americans that otherwise would expire in January. But it would deny those reductions to individuals making over 200,000 yearly and couples earning at least 250,000. Passage of the Democratic measure put the Senate on record as backing a bill that closely follows the tax-cutting vision of President Barack Obama. It averted what would have been a significant embarrassment for Democrats and Obama, who has made tax fairness _ meaning tax increases on the rich _ an overarching theme of his re-election campaign. The vote also serves as a counterpoint to the GOP-run House, which next week will approve tax cuts nearly identical to the 405 billion Republican plan the Senate rejected Wednesday. \\"The question is, who are you fighting for,\\" Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said before the vote. \\"Are you fighting for the people who make a billion dollars a year? That's who the Republicans are fighting for, and they get so emotional about it. Or are you fighting for the middle class, the heart and soul of America.\\" Republicans said the measure was all about Democratic posturing for the upcoming elections and would hurt the economy because boosting taxes on the wealthy will hinder them from hiring workers for their companies. \\"Thank goodness it's not going anywhere because it would be bad for the economy, the single worst thing we could do to the country,\\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said. With Senate control at stake in November's elections, Republicans were hoping that several Democrats seeking re-election would hurt their candidacies by having backed the Democratic package. The bill would dramatically boost the estate tax, which would be widely unpopular in farming, ranching and high cost-of-living states, and increase levies on dividends and capital gains, which are relied on by many elderly people. \\"That's what today's votes are all about,\\" McConnell said in a thinly veiled warning to Democrats. \\"Showing the people who sent us here where we stand.\\" The White House chimed in by reiterating its support for the Democratic plan. \\"All sides agree on the need to extend the tax cuts for the middle class,\\" the White House wrote in a statement. \\"This legislation reflects that consensus and should not be held hostage while debating the merits of another tax cut for the wealthy.\\" Under the Democratic measure, individuals earning over 200,000 and couples making at least 250,000 would see their top rates rise from 33 percent and 35 percent today to 36 percent and 39.6 percent in January. Democrats argue that the well-off should contribute to efforts to contain federal deficits, while Republicans say many of those affected own businesses and would have a harder time hiring workers. The increase would affect 2.5 million households, or 2 percent of all 140.5 million tax returns, according to 2009 Internal Revenue Service statistics. The Democratic bill would also boost the top tax rate paid by people who inherit estates to 55 percent, exempting the first 1 million in an estate's value. The GOP measure would maintain today's 35 percent top rate and would not tax the first 5.12 million of an estate's value. In fresh figures released this week by Republicans, Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Democratic provision would affect 55,200 estates next year, compared with 3,600 who would face estate taxes under the GOP plan. Democrats would impose top tax rates next year of 20 percent on dividends and capital gains, two sources of income enjoyed disproportionately by the wealthy. The GOP top rate would be 15 percent. The GOP bill ignores some tax credits for low- and middle-income families that Democrats want to extend for college costs; for some low-income couples and large working families; and for families with children. All were part of Obama's economic 2009 stimulus bill. Democrats say those tax breaks were meant to be permanent but Republicans say they were only a short-term response to the recession. ___ Associated Press writer Jim Kuhnhenn contributed to this report. ||||| The Senate on Wednesday narrowly approved a plan to preserve tax cuts for the middle class while letting them expire for the wealthy, a powerful if largely symbolic victory for Democrats who have been pushing to raise taxes on the rich for more than a decade. The measure is dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled House, where leaders are preparing to vote next week on their own plan to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for households at every income level through 2013. But Democratic lawmakers said the Senate’s 51-48 vote is a political breakthrough that strengthens their election-year argument that Republicans are holding tax cuts for the middle class hostage in order to maintain breaks worth 160,000 a year to the average millionaire. “If House Republicans insist on blocking our middle-class tax cuts, that is a debate we are willing to have. That is a debate we welcome,” Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a speech on the Senate floor. For more than a decade, Republicans “have conflated tax cuts for the middle class and tax cuts for the very wealthy. This bill breaks that vice.” Vice President Biden presided over the late-afternoon vote, though with only 99 senators present, there was never much chance that he would be called upon to break a tie. His appearance highlighted the importance of the issue for President Obama, who has made tax “fairness” a centerpiece of his reelection campaign against GOP challenger Mitt Romney. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) accused Democrats of playing politics with the nation’s tax code. Noting Biden’s presence, McConnell recalled that the last time the Bush tax cuts were set to expire, Biden asked McConnell to help the White House extend all of them, even breaks on income over 250,000 a year, to avoid harming a fragile economy. “Today, the economy is growing slower than it was in December 2010,” McConnell said. “This is more about the election than it is the economy. And I’m sure a few arms have been twisted in order to get a result.” Only two of 53 senators who caucus with Democrats voted against the measure. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) said he opposes any extension of the tax cuts, preferring that lawmakers take up far-reaching tax reform this year. Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.) had the opposite complaint; aides said Webb “opposes raising taxes on ordinary earned income.” But Sen. Kay Hagen (D-N.C.) flew back to Washington from a funeral to cast her vote to support the measure. And several Democrats in tight races, including Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.), voted yes despite Republican arguments that the bill would permit the tax rates on inheritances worth more than 1 million to shoot up to 55 percent, striking millions of family farms and small businesses. On an earlier vote, the Senate rejected a GOP plan to extend all the Bush tax cuts, 45 to 54. Senators from both sides crossed party lines, with Republicans Scott Brown (Mass.) and Susan Collins (Me.) rejecting the extension and Democrat Mark Pryor (Ark.) supporting it. The votes capped a surprising day that began with McConnell announcing that he would waive procedural hurdles and permit the Senate to hold an up-or-down vote on the measure, in exchange for an agreement by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to call a vote on the Republican bill, as well. McConnell acknowledged the unusual nature of his decision — Democratic aides could not recall another occasion when McConnell permitted a simple majority vote on a contentious issue. McConnell said his goal was to force vulnerable Democrats to support a plan to raise taxes less than four months before the Nov. 6 ballot. “By setting these votes at a 50-vote threshold, nobody on the other side can hide behind a procedural vote while leaving their views on the actual bill itself a mystery to the people who sent them here,” McConnell said. Moreover, McConnell said, the tax bill cannot advance because it is a Senate-originated tax measure. The Constitution requires all tax measures to originate in the House. “The only reason we won’t block it today is that we know it doesn’t pass constitutional muster and won’t become law,” McConnell said. “What today’s votes are all about,” he said, is “showing the people who sent us here where we stand.” The ideological stalemate between the House and Senate leaves the nation facing what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has called a “fiscal cliff” in January, when a payroll tax cut and other temporary tax breaks are set to expire, along with the Bush tax cuts. Factoring in automatic cuts set to hit the Pentagon and other federal agencies, the fiscal cliff threatens to siphon 600 billion out of the economy next year, potentially throwing the nation back into recession. |||||","completion":"Senate Democrats passed a plan to extend current tax rates for all but the top income earners.

While attending the funeral of his father, Melvin Devereux (John Savage), meets a beautiful young woman (Sandi Schultz) who addresses him by name, although he cannot remember having met her before. After an enigmatic exchange of casual words, Devereux drives away, motoring aimlessly around New Orleans. Devereux decides to ignore warning barriers and drives onto a closed freeway. But the police follow him and he is forced to turn aside. His car breaks down in a decapitated area of the city.

The underlying virus-host interactions and cellular mechanisms that promote co-existence remain ill-defined, but physiological traits such as flight and longevity are proposed to drive these adaptations. Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic process that regulates ageing, metabolism, and intrinsic immune defense. We quantified basal and stimulated autophagic responses in black flying fox cells, and demonstrated that although black flying fox cells are susceptible to Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) infection, viral replication is dampened in these bat cells. Black flying fox cells tolerated prolonged ABLV infection with less cell death relative to comparable human cells, suggesting post-entry mechanisms interference with virus replication. An elevated basal autophagic level was observed and autophagy was induced in response to high virus doses. Pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy pathway reduced virus replication, indicating autophagy acts as an anti-viral mechanism. Enhancement of basal and virus-induced autophagy in bat cells connects related reports that long-lived species possess homeostatic processes that dampen oxidative stress and macromolecule damage. Exemplifying the potential that evolved cellular homeostatic adaptations like autophagy may secondarily act as anti-viral mechanisms, enabling bats to serve as natural hosts to an assortment of pathogenic viruses. Furthermore, our data suggest autophagy-inducing drugs may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for combating lyssavirus infection. Viruses 2019, 11, 260 2 of 18 (EBOV) [9], and MARV [3,4,10], seroconverted, but did not develop pathology and only a minority of infected bats shed low level of virus in urine (NiV) [8] or high levels of virus orally (MARV) [4]. This combination of host-viral richness and apparent lack of clinical disease presentation after NiV, HeV, EBOV, or MARV infection raises the question how novel intrinsic traits or host adaptations might promote tolerance of virus infection in bats [11, 12] . As bats are the only volant mammals, flight has been proposed to contribute to the ability of bats to function as natural reservoirs [11] [12] [13] . The aerobic demands of flight experienced by bats is higher than the aerobic demands of other terrestrial mammals experienced during aerobic exertion [14] . Positive selection of genes involved in DNA-damage repair pathways [11] and reduced free-radical production [15] in bats suggest an evolved response to the deleterious effects of an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high aerobic demands of flight. Cellular ageing occurs through a progressive accumulation of damaged organelles, misfolded and aggregated proteins, and dysregulation of cellular homeostatic processes [16, 17] . ROS can cause oxidative damage to macromolecules and DNA [18] , and ultimately contribute to cellular ageing. However, bats have a greater longevity [19] than what is typically projected in relation to their body size [20, 21] , and resistance to oxidative stress has been observed in long-lived bat species [22, 23] . Furthermore, the loss of DNA sensors in the PYHIN family [24] and decreased activity of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) [12] , may contribute to dampened inflammatory responses to the release of cytosolic DNA due to metabolic-related DNA damage or microbial infection [25] . In addition, enhanced protein homeostatic mechanisms, such as macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), were observed in bat cells [26] . At the crossroads of DNA-damage, oxidative stress, and microbial infection [27, 28] , autophagy, is a proteostatic process involved in cellular homeostasis, longevity, and survival [29, 30] . Canonically regarded as a response to starvation, the autophagy pathway recycles long-lived proteins, misfolded proteins, and damaged organelles during times of nutrient depletion. However, there are also multiple examples of selective autophagic pathways that utilize specific protein receptors to traffic ubiquitinated target organelles and proteins into cytoplasmic double-membraned vesicles, termed autophagosomes [31] . In addition to cellular stressors such as DNA damage and ROS, pathogen-recognition receptors can activate distinct autophagic processes as part of an intrinsic immune response [32] [33] [34] . For example, \\"xenophagy\\" shuttles intracellular microbes to autolysosomes for lysis, whereas \\"aggrephagy\\" removes toxic protein aggregates [35, 36] . Aerobic demands, ROS, nutritional starvation, or virus infections are all physical stressors that challenge cellular homeostasis [37] . Virus exploitation of host cell transcriptional and translational machinery ensures successful replication, but can trigger the unfolded protein response [38] , and dysregulation of cellular homeostatic mechanisms [39] . Therefore, if bats have evolved mechanisms to dampen cellular damage caused by the by-products of heightened aerobic respiration through improved proteostatic mechanisms, then these same proteostatic mechanisms might also function as anti-viral defenses. We undertook a comparative study to examine host-pathogen interactions in bat versus human cells, focusing on the potential anti-viral or pro-survival mechanism of autophagy. For this study we chose to utilize Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), a neurotropic rabies-related virus that naturally infects black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) [40, 41] , but is classified as a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) pathogen. Pteropus species are also the natural reservoirs of several zoonotic viruses including HeV, NiV [2], and Menangle virus [42, 43] . Cell lines have been established from the black flying fox [44] , which with the publication of its reference genome [11] , has been promoted as a model bat species. Black flying fox cell lines have been used to investigate the interferon response [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] , as well as transcriptomic and proteomic responses after HeV infection [51] . We rescued a modified recombinant ABLV expressing a green fluorescent protein (rABLV-GFP) and used both rABLV-GFP and a wild-type ABLV (wt-ABLV) to examine the role of autophagy after virus infection. In black flying fox cells, the basal level of autophagy was significantly higher than the levels of autophagy quantified in the human cell line used for comparative purposes. We observed that ABLV infection activated the autophagy pathway Title: Enhanced Autophagy Contributes to Reduced Viral Infection in Black Flying Fox Cells A:","completion":"In this task, you are given a paragraph from a research paper along with a title.

Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.

It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).Albrecht Dürer was an avid student of exotic animals, and drew many sketches based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, and it is likely the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.Attempts to find sources for the work in literature from the period have not been successful. Art historian Erwin Panofsky wrote in 1953 that, \\"In spite of all the ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of \\"decoding Jerome Bosch\\", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose father was of Polish Roman Catholic descent? from the following article ? Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him.

Write an article based on this \\"Draw the polygon whose angles you need to sum. Choose one vertex. Draw a straight line from Point A to each other vertex in the polygon. Multiply the number of triangles you created by 180.\\"","completion":"Title: Understanding Basic Geometry: How to Calculate the Sum of Internal Angles in a Polygon Introduction Geometry is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, angles, and dimensions of various objects. One of the key concepts in geometry is the polygon, a closed two-dimensional shape with straight sides. In this article, we will discuss a simple and straightforward method to calculate the sum of internal angles of any given polygon using a popular technique known as triangulation. We will first define what a polygon is, and then, step by step, we will guide you through the entire process of finding the sum of its angles. Defining the Polygon A polygon is a closed two-dimensional geometric figure with at least three straight sides and angles, which are formed when two sides meet at the vertices, or corners, of the shape. Some common examples of polygons include triangles (3 sides), quadrilaterals (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), and hexagons (6 sides). Every polygon has a specific number of vertices, sides, and angles, and the sum of these internal angles can provide valuable information about the shape's properties. Triangulation Technique: A Step by Step Process To calculate the sum of internal angles of the polygon, we will follow the steps described in the task, which relies on the principle of triangulation. This method divides the polygon into a set of non-overlapping triangles, whose angles' sum is equal to the sum of the polygon's angles. Step 1: Draw the Polygon First and foremost, sketch the given polygon on a piece of paper or on any available drawing platform. It is essential to ensure that the polygon is drawn accurately, with all its sides connected and forming a closed shape. Step 2: Choose a Vertex Select one vertex within the polygon that will serve as a point of reference or the center of triangulation. This vertex is commonly referred to as Point A. make sure it is clearly marked. Step 3: Draw Straight Lines From Point A, draw straight lines to each of the other vertices in the polygon, excluding the vertices that are directly adjacent to Point A as they already form a triangle with it. These lines essentially create multiple non-overlapping triangles within the context of the polygon. Step 4: Count the Number of Triangles Once all the triangles have been created, count the total number of triangles formed within the polygon. This number will be directly correlated to the number of sides (n) in the polygon, with the number of triangles being equal to n-2. Step 5: Multiply by 180 Since the sum of angles in every triangle is always equal to 180 degrees, multiply the number of triangles obtained in the previous step by 180. The resulting value represents the sum of the internal angles of the polygon. Final Thoughts In conclusion, finding the sum of internal angles in a polygon is a straightforward process that relies on the principle of triangulation. By following the mentioned steps of drawing the polygon, choosing a vertex, making straight lines to other vertices, counting the triangles, and multiplying by 180, one can easily acquire the desired sum. This knowledge opens up a world of possibilities when exploring the properties of various polygons in geometry. It serves as a foundation for understanding various geometric concepts and shapes and is vital for anyone studying geometry, architecture, or any field that deals with shapes and measurements."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who only bid on a few of the dozens that were offered to him? The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity. His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned 63 million, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making 40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), Len Barry's \\"1-2-3\\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \\"The Wanderer\\" (1961) and \\"Runaround Sue\\" (1961).

The given premise states that if his theory were true, Edmund Hillary's ascent of Mount Everest would have been motivated by a desire to test new oxygen tanks, and Joshua Slocum would have circumnavigated the world to rack up frequent-sailing miles. It appears that the premise is suggesting that the motivations behind these historical accomplishments are misconstrued or misrepresented in the given theory. Sir Edmund Hillary, a New Zealand mountaineer, along with Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa-climber from Nepal, became the first climbers to successfully scale Mount Everest, which was on May 29, 1953. While Hillary may have had multiple reasons for attempting the climb, testing new oxygen tanks is not widely known as his primary motivation. Hillary was known for his passion for adventure and mountaineering. As part of the ninth British Mount Everest expedition, it was a collaborative effort to reach the summit of the highest mountain peak in the world, driven by personal ambition, a sense of adventure, and a desire for exploration. Joshua Slocum was the first person to sail single-handedly around the world, completing his voyage between 1895 and 1898. His journey was an ambitious undertaking, driven by the same sense of adventure and exploration that inspired Hillary. Slocum's decision to embark on this journey was essentially to demonstrate his skill as a seaman and to document the experience in his book, \\"Sailing Alone Around the World.\\" While one could argue that accruing \\"frequent-sailing miles\\" in the modern sense did not exist during Slocum's time, the essence of the premise seems to trivialize his accomplishments rather than focusing on the actual motivations and true groundbreaking nature of his voyage. The premise essentially attempts to frame these historical accomplishments based on superficial or trivial motivations. In doing so, the premise tries to make the underlying theory seem ridiculous. However, we must also consider if this is a fair representation of the true motivations behind these events, or if the premise has taken the theorist's statements out of context for the sake of discrediting them. Assuming that the premise accurately represents the theory in question, it can be said that the hypothesis \\"His theory is a ridiculous one and should not be taken seriously\\" holds some merit. The premise seems to trivialize both Slocum's and Hillary's accomplishments, attributing inconsequential reasons to these significant events. It discredits the adventurous spirit and exploratory nature that drove both Hillary and Slocum, ignoring the deeper meaning behind their journeys. However, if the premise misrepresents the true intentions behind the theory, then the hypothesis would be flawed and inaccurate. It is essential to keep an open mind and critically evaluate the information being presented before reaching a conclusion on the validity of the hypothesis. In conclusion, if the premise accurately portrays the theory in question, one could agree that the hypothesis \\"His theory is a ridiculous one and should not be taken seriously\\" is true. However, if the premise misrepresents the theory or takes it out of context, then the hypothesis would need to be reevaluated in light of the entire context and accurate information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: No grades (ever), no sitting down at desks, and harnessing student boredom as a motivator to create and explore might seem an odd recipe for academic success and entry to university, but that is exactly what one of Scotland's newest schools is attempting to do. Drumdruan Upper School was created a few years ago by Scottish actress Tilda Swinton, star of many a Hollywood blockbuster and forever in my mind the terrifying Witch in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The school extends a Steiner education beyond the age of 14, and takes students through to their University years. The Observer has published a fascinating and detailed account of some of the recipe that makes this a special place and, above all, has bowled over the traditionally conservative schools inspectorate: That is not what happened: the inspectors sat in the classes and watched the students. And if you watch the students at Drumduan, you soon notice they are confident, articulate, highly motivated and respectful. These are, in fact, the words used by the inspectors in their subsequent report. You might even believe the students at Drumduan wanted to be there. The inspectors clearly felt so, but it was when they had retired to an office to confer that Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, delivered the coup de grace. He sang to them. Music is something of a hallmark at Drumduan, where children participate in regular workshops – often on instruments like a wheelie bin – and start each day singing in four-part harmonies. “We were rehearsing in another room, and I said: ‘This song is terrific, we have to show these inspectors,’” Krzysztof recalls. “So we burst into their office – they were a bit alarmed – and I said: ‘I’m sorry, we’ve just got to sing this song to you.’” The song was “Media Vita”, a medieval score of haunting beauty that reduced the inspectors to tears, according to Krzysztof. Bowled over by their praise – he is a man whose emotions are close to the surface – Krzysztof asked if he could give them a hug, probably a...

Sell cosmetics, I was going to say. And then I was going to add their own phrase, “inspired by.” But then I just had to stop for a second, because it ain’t easy to complete this sentence, because what the sisters Mulleavy of Rodarte were allegedly “inspired by” is the border city of JuÃ¡rez, Mexico. As Style.com’s Nicole Phelps explained back in February about the Rodarte Fall/Winter 2010 collection, “[T]hey became interested in the troubled border town of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez; the hazy, dreamlike quality of the landscape there; and the maquiladora workers going to the factory in the middle of the night.” For serious. And: The show ended with a quartet of ethereal, unraveling, rather beautiful white dresses that alternately called to mind quinceaÃ±era parties, corpse brides, and, if you wanted to look at it through a really dark prism, the ghosts of the victims of JuÃ¡rez’s drug wars. The names of the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte cosmetics that were to go on sale this fall-blush, lip gloss, eyeshadows and nail polish, and so on-included “factory,” “JuÃ¡rez,” “Ghost town,” “del Norte” and “quinceaÃ±era.” Maybe it was overreacting, to be appalled by this news? Maybe the Mulleavys and their colleagues were not really really intending to glamorize the violence and bloodshed and horror of life in that sad and dangerous town. Oh yes, well then, take a gander at the models-and the makeup. All hell started breaking loose, a lot of bloggers wrote about it and then, around the 16th of June, MÂ·AÂ·C and Rodarte issued these statements! That are crazy! Just thinking about the number of people who have to have been involved in this product development, who have to have known about it, is disturbing. Did any of them speak up, as this product was being designed, packaged, prepared for market? Did anyone figure out to say, this stuff we are making here, that you put on your FACE, you know, it looks like blood. It suggests carnage, blood, in the desert, blood of abducted, raped, strangled women? Does it suggest that to you, a little bit? Apparently, no. MÂ·AÂ·C Cosmetics Statement: We understand that product names in the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte collection have offended some of our consumers and fans. This was never our intent and we are very sorry. We are listening carefully to the comments posted and are grateful to those of you who have brought your concerns to the forefront of our attention. MÂ·AÂ·C will give a portion of the proceeds from the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte collection to help those in need in Juarez. We are diligently investigating the best way to do this. Please be assured that we will keep you posted on the details regarding our efforts. Rodarte Company Statement: Our makeup collaboration with MÂ·AÂ·C developed from inspirations on a road trip that we took in Texas last year, from El Paso to Marfa. The ethereal nature of this landscape influenced the creative development and desert palette of the collection. We are truly saddened about injustice in Juarez and it is a very important issue to us. The MÂ·AÂ·C collaboration was intended as a celebration of the beauty of the landscape and people in the areas that we traveled. Okay, yes! Fine. We made our makeup look like blood because it is a celebration of the beauty. So, now that’s cleared up, right? No! OMG, people were still mad!! So on or about July 19th, MÂ·AÂ·C announced that they were going to change the names of this stuff, that you put on your face, and also “donate 100,000 to an organization that helps women in Juarez.” And then everyone calmed down-oh wait! No sorry, still no! Fury still raging unabated for entitled materialist horrorshow! Finally, on Friday, MÂ·AÂ·C issued another a press release explaining that now, all profits from the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte collection will go to “a newly created initiative to raise awareness and provide on-the-ground support to the women and girls in Juarez.” Evidently they went clear to Mexico in order to try to recover a shred or two of dignity; even the tone of this press release grows humbler: …MÂ·AÂ·C and Rodarte are deeply sorry that this makeup collection was so offensive to the people of Mexico and concerned global citizens. This announcement follows a meeting last evening in Mexico City with MÂ·AÂ·C executives and Mexican government officials, including CONAVIM (ComisiÃ³n Nacional Para Prevenir y Erradicar la Violencia Contra las Mujeres/National Commission to Prevent and Eradicate Violence Against Women.) During the meeting, held at the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this collective group committed to working together on the overall direction of the new initiative to help the women and girls of Juarez and to raise global awareness of their plight. MÂ·AÂ·C executives reiterated their deep regret and reinforced that it was never MÂ·AÂ·C’s or Rodarte’s intent to minimize the suffering of the women and girls of Ciudad Juarez. So, if the strategy of giving 100% of their profits to charity also fails to repair their shattered image, one is forced to wonder whether MÂ·AÂ·C and Rodarte are planning to step in and do something about Mexican police corruption, next. After that, if necessary, maybe they can turn their attention to the crooked elections, and finally the drug cartels. The cliché view of fashion insiders as shallow and uninformed remains completely undisturbed by this fiasco. The disconnect between the actual facts on the ground in JuÃ¡rez and these surreal press releases and the reactions from the fashion press they spawned could not be more eye-crossing. Nobody at Rodarte seems to have objected to anything about the Style.com review of their show back in February, which directly referenced JuÃ¡rez; there was no outcry from the fashion press at that time, that I could find. It’s only when MÂ·AÂ·C started passing out the press releases to a larger public that a multitude of hackles went up. Indeed, the objections of quite a number of “concerned global citizens” have been met with outright mockery on the New York magazine fashion blog The Cut and elsewhere. This is a pity. In times past there have been very cultivated, well-informed men and women in charge of the schmattas. I’d go so far as to say that the ideal of the fashion world used to represent a union of taste and intelligence; and really, is is possible to have one without the other? Where is the Cecil Beaton of today? The Christian Dior, the Diana Vreeland? And is it remotely possible that the Mulleavy sisters were trying to make a Guernica-like statement with their art? It is possible. Except… they’ve responded to the criticism by backpedaling furiously, which says something about the authenticity or seriousness of the original statement. So maybe it’s as simple as it looks: for Rodarte to exploit the catastrophe in JuÃ¡rez in order to sell dresses and makeup demonstrates the dehumanizing effects of a debased, pathologically materialist society that has evidently gone clean off the rails. It would be easy to make that observation and dismiss the whole affair. It’s worth asking, though: what is really going on when violence and horror are appropriated in order to create a consumer product? Because quite often the makers of newpapers, books and films are involved in creating consumer products based on real horror, just as these raggers tried (and failed) to do. To take this comparison to an extreme, let’s consider the novel 2666, by the late Roberto BolaÃ±o. This book, like the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte makeup, is both a comment on the JuÃ¡rez femicides and a consumer product. The Part About the Crimes, the fourth section of 2666, is something like a catalogue of the femicides, deliberately dry, without poetry. It’s more or less a list of bodies, with details of their height, their hair color, their clothes, written with a police-procedural air. It is punishing to read, the longest part of a long book, written in deliberately ugly, dull prose; this, from a man capable of the utmost inventiveness, wit and penetration. So what’s the difference between selling eyeshadow “inspired by” these terrible events, and writing a novel about them? I submit that the difference is one of vanity. Rodarte was posing alongside the victims of JuÃ¡rez, in a way, asking you to be shocked and titillated by the real live goth corpses, the disturbing juxtaposition of horror and beauty. But nothing was meant to change in JuÃ¡rez or anywhere else as the result of this aestheticized rubbernecking. BolaÃ±o, on the other hand, wasn’t asking anything at all (aside from asking that you read his book.) 2666 isn’t a call to arms. It offers nothing in the way of judgments, let alone solutions. There’s no self-aggrandizement, no style; the author of 2666 has erased himself right out of the picture, leaving just a mirror of the human condition for you to look in. This is a matter of telling the truth, a deliberate avoidance of the “sensational.” Where Rodarte attemped to steal the terrible emotions evoked by the fact that hundreds, maybe thousands of girls have been abducted, raped and murdered in JuÃ¡rez, and trivialize (and then, “monetize”) those emotions by turning them into eyeshadow, BolaÃ±o asks that you stop being horrified, and just look at the truth; nothing more. What happens afterward is left for us to determine.

Write an article with the title: \\"A Flower Arrangement Inspired by Frida Kahlo\\" Article:","completion":"Title: A Flower Arrangement Inspired by Frida Kahlo Introduction: (Step 1: Introduce the subject and provide context about Frida Kahlo and her art) Frida Kahlo, an iconic Mexican artist, is known for her powerful and evocative paintings that have been celebrated worldwide. Her art has been a source of inspiration for many people, capturing the essence of Mexican culture with its bold colors and intricate detailing. In this article, we will explore a flower arrangement inspired by the artistic genius of Frida Kahlo and guide you through creating a floral masterpiece that embodies her vibrant spirit. Background on Frida Kahlo: (Step 2: Provide more information about Frida Kahlo's life and art) Born in 1907 in Mexico City, Frida Kahlo's artistic journey was heavily influenced by her life experiences and heritage. Her work often portrayed the intense emotions she felt, as well as her love for Mexican traditions. Through her paintings and self-portraits, Kahlo showcased her unique perspective on life, love, pain, and identity, which resonates with viewers even decades after her passing. Choosing the Flowers: (Step 3: Explain how to select the right flowers and colors inspired by Kahlo's art) To create a floral arrangement that reflects Frida Kahlo's artistry, start by selecting flowers with vibrant hues and intricate details. Mexican marigolds, calla lilies, and hibiscus are popular choices for Mexican-inspired arrangements. Additionally, you can incorporate other flowers like dahlias, sunflowers, roses, and orchids to add depth and variety. Pay particular attention to color composition, striving for visually appealing combinations and contrasts. You may want to reference a specific Kahlo painting to guide your color choices. Arrangement Design: (Step 4: Describe the design process of the flower arrangement) Frida Kahlo often used symmetry in her paintings, adding an aesthetically pleasing balance to her compositions. To achieve a similar effect in your arrangement, consider creating a balanced layout with flowers of similar shapes and sizes on both sides. Incorporate various textures by including flowers with unique foliage, like ferns, eucalyptus, and ruscus. You can also add artistic elements such as ribbons or small tokens, like miniature picture frames, to represent her signature self-portraits. Container Selection: (Step 5: Choose a suitable container for the flower arrangement) To fully capture the essence of Frida Kahlo's art, select a container that complements the floral design and reflects Mexican culture. Traditional Mexican pottery, like Talavera vases or urns, can add an authentic touch to your arrangement. Alternatively, you can use a simple container and decorate it with bright, patterned fabrics or ribbons. Finishing Touches: (Step 6: Finalize the arrangement with additional details) To complete your Frida Kahlo-inspired flower arrangement, add the finishing touches that pay homage to the artist's signature style. Consider incorporating a bold eyebrow design made from thin, flexible branches or small flowers, as seen in her self-portraits. You can also attach a small, framed print of a Kahlo painting to the arrangement for an added touch of creativity. Conclusion: (Step 7: Conclude the article by summarizing the key points) By following these steps, you can create a stunning flower arrangement that captures the essence of Frida Kahlo's art and celebrates her unique contributions to the world of art. This floral masterpiece can serve as an eye-catching centerpiece for an event or simply as a vibrant reminder of the rich and passionate spirit of the iconic Mexican artist. So, gather your materials, unleash your creativity, and let Frida Kahlo's spirit guide you in crafting a floral tribute to her incredible artistic legacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The squirrels are very ingenious however but this feeder requires more work to get a little seed. The squirrels lose interest after awhile. Answer:","completion":"The impact of the review on the decision-making process greatly depends on several factors. The review suggests both positive and negative aspects of the product, making it a balanced review that provides valuable information for potential buyers. The review increases the chances of purchasing the product to some extent as it indicates that the feeder under review has a large capacity. For potential buyers, especially those who want to feed numerous birds or refill the feeder less frequently, this feature could be seen as highly beneficial. A large capacity feeder can hold more seeds, which is practical for attracting a variety of birds and keeping them fed for longer periods. On the other hand, the review could also decrease the probability of purchasing the product as it points out that the feeder is somewhat squirrel resistant. This could be viewed in two ways: a positive feature for those who want to deter squirrels from accessing the bird seed, as it requires the squirrels to work harder and often they lose interest. Thus, it may save bird seed in the long run and keep it specifically for the birds. Conversely, if a potential buyer does not have a squirrel problem or enjoys feeding squirrels, this might be seen as a disadvantage. They may prefer a feeder that's easy access for all creatures. Therefore, it's essential to consider your own needs, preferences, and circumstances when interpretating and applying the information given in the review.

The current Member of Parliament (MP) for Norwich South is Clive Lewis, who is a member of the Labour Party. He has held this position since May 2015. Clive Lewis has not served as the Home Secretary in the UK government. However, the former Home Secretary to which you may have been referring could be Charles Clarke. Charles Clarke, also a member of the Labour Party, served as the Home Secretary in the United Kingdom between December 2004 and May 2006 under the Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair. Charles Clarke was the MP for Norwich South from 1997 until 2010 when he lost his seat to the Liberal Democrat candidate Simon Wright, who then held the position until 2015. As a Home Secretary, Charles Clarke was responsible for overseeing significant and sometimes controversial policy developments pertaining to national security, crime reduction, and anti-terrorism. Some of the most notable policy initiatives during his tenure include the relaxation of licensing laws, expansion of community policing, and the unsuccessful attempt to increase the detention period of terrorism suspects without charge from 14 to 90 days.

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Last year, Dr. Kiran Sagar, a cardiologist in Wisconsin, was fired two months after presenting strong data showing that cardiologists in the hospital she worked at misread a substantial number of heart tests. Similarly, a nurse from Columbia Hospital Corp. of America (HCA) was let go after complaining that a doctor was performing unnecessary cardiac procedures, even after an internal investigation found the nurse's claim to be substantiated. And a few weeks ago, the CBS News program \\"60 Minutes\\" reported on ER doctors fired for not meeting quotas on the percentage of patients they admitted to the hospital. These recent patterns of firings send yet another strong message to every doctor and nurse who has ever considered speaking up about dangerous and fraudulent medical care: Speak up and risk destroying your career. The culture of health care needs to change. Medical mistakes cause too many needless harm or deaths, yet few people see the problem in this context because we rarely have an open and honest conversation about the quality of health care in America. When we do, it is often behind closed doors. This is a challenge that a new generation of doctors is working to change through initiatives ranging from more transparent bedside care to public reporting of hospital performance. Doctors and nurses increasingly feel disconnected from policymakers and even their own hospitals, some of which have transformed into giant corporations. Despite concerns from the Federal Trade Commission that costs will go up for consumers, hospital mega-mergers are on the rise. This past year saw a large number of hospital mergers and acquisitions in health care. While some hospital executives have commendably used a hospital chain's large size to standardize best practices, others have fallen into the age-old management trap of detaching themselves from the front lines and becoming dangerously out of touch with their own staff. I talk to doctors and nurses around the country every week. One trend that seems clear is that more doctors and nurses are feeling frustrated. A recent national study by Mayo Clinic researchers shows that doctor burnout rate is now up to a staggering 46%. A new phenomenon, quite different from when my father practiced medicine, is that doctors and nurses now say they feel like they are tenants working for their landlord: the hospital management. Often, doctors and nurses know how to make care better and safer but feel stripped of the power to make necessary changes. This worker-management disconnect (even antagonism) in any industry is dangerous. In medicine this workplace atmosphere, complicated by perverse economic incentives and weak systems of accountability, contributes to a hospital culture marked by a lack of a sense of communal ownership in the overall delivery of care. What results is a poorer quality of care, more overtreatment, more fraud, more medical mistakes, and more patients falling through the cracks. According to a 2009 CBS-New York Times poll, 77% of Americans say they are satisfied with the quality of their health care. But what makes people think the health care they're receiving is good? Very little. A Harvard study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported an alarming fact: 18% of patients were actually harmed by medical care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 30% of health care procedures, tests and other services do not improve health outcomes. For instance, if you had a medical condition, would you go to a hospital that has performed more than 1,000 unnecessary procedures? Probably not. As much as one-third of all health care expenditures may be going to waste, fraud and unnecessary medical care. This problem is high on the agenda for the American Board of Internal Medicine. Other physician groups have joined the \\"Choosing Wisely\\" Campaign to address unnecessary care in American medicine. The Institute of Medicine is calling attention to the problem, and many medical researchers are speaking openly about it. But more needs to be done. Rather than reinforce a closed-door culture in American medicine, hospitals should use their new large size to encourage external and independent peer reviews and create a culture of transparency. Patients should be encouraged to keep a copy of their medical records, not inconvenienced with burdensome processes and extra charges to obtain them. A hospital's front-line health care workers are their work engine, and these people should be encouraged to voice their safety concerns to their managers. Mega-hospitals need to stay true to their mission and not fall into the large corporate pitfalls that can erode the standing of any business. A workplace culture that punishes those who speak up about problems by depriving them of their career livelihood is part of the problem itself. As a surgeon, I sometimes see patients after they have blindly walked into the hands of dangerous, expensive and avoidable care. If we are serious about improving health care quality and lowering costs, we need to address the issue of accountability. Our hospitals must be more accountable to patients and doctors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marty Makary. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The culture of healthcare needs to change to improve patient safety and reduce medical mistakes. Recent patterns of firing doctors and nurses who raise concerns about dangerous and fraudulent medical care are reinforcing the closed-door culture, preventing transparency and ultimately contributing to more needless harm or deaths. Hospital mega-mergers are on the rise, which can lead to executives becoming dangerously detached from their staff. Doctors and nurses often feel disconnected from policymakers and even their own hospitals. They feel like tenants working for their landlords, the hospital management, rather than empowered individuals. As a result, they are often aware of how to make care better and safer but lack the authority to do so. This workplace disconnect leads to poorer quality of care, overtreatment, fraud, and more medical mistakes. To address this issue, hospitals should encourage external and independent peer reviews, create an environment of transparency, allow patients to keep copies of their medical records, and empower frontline healthcare workers to voice their concerns. Furthermore, mega-hospitals should focus on their mission and avoid the pitfalls of large corporations. Improving healthcare quality and lowering costs require addressing accountability. Hospitals must become more accountable to patients and doctors.

Is turn used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? Turn your face to the wall. The people turned against the President when he stole the election.","completion":"No, the word \\"turn\\" is not used to mean the same thing in these two sentences. In both cases, the word \\"turn\\" is used as a verb, but its context and implications differ. In the first sentence, \\"Turn your face to the wall,\\" the word \\"turn\\" is used in a physical sense, indicating a change in direction or orientation of your face. In this context, it means to rotate your head so that your face is now pointing towards the wall, possibly moving from one position to another. This usage implies a change in the spatial arrangement of your face relative to the wall, and the action is straightforward and literal. In the second sentence, \\"The people turned against the President when he stole the election,\\" the word \\"turn\\" is used in a more metaphorical and abstract sense. Here, \\"turn\\" indicates a change in the people's attitude, loyalty, support, or opinion towards the President. The action of turning against the President implies that the people's perspective or stance has shifted from being in favor or supportive of the President to being against him, due to his actions of stealing the election. This usage is more figurative and denotes a psychological or emotional change rather than a physical one. In conclusion, although the word \\"turn\\" is used as a verb in both sentences, its meaning changes depending on the context. In the first sentence, it refers to a physical rotation or movement, while in the second sentence, it represents a change in attitude, loyalty, or opinion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: If less ozone means more ultraviolet light, then what increases ultraviolet light? Answer choices: - heating liquids - clouds - smog - emissions - less ozone - gravity - sun's heat - photons A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's consider the given answer choices and their relationships with ultraviolet (UV) light: 1. Heating liquids: Heating liquids does not directly increase the amount of ultraviolet light. 2. Clouds: Clouds may partially block UV radiation, so their presence generally does not increase the amount of ultraviolet light. 3. Smog: Smog is a form of air pollution, which can absorb or scatter some UV radiation. However, smog itself does not directly increase the amount of ultraviolet light. 4. Emissions: Emissions result in air pollution, which can deplete the ozone layer through reactions with certain chemicals such as CFCs. While emissions contribute to ozone depletion, they do not directly increase the amount of ultraviolet light. 5. Less ozone: As stated in the question, less ozone means more ultraviolet light due to the reduced protective layer in the Earth's atmosphere. 6. Gravity: Gravity is not directly related to the amount of ultraviolet light. 7. Sun's heat: The sun emits UV radiation as part of its electromagnetic spectrum, but the sun's heat in isolation is not directly responsible for an increase in ultraviolet light. 8. Photons: Photons are particles of light that carry energy, including ultraviolet radiation. However, photons themselves do not increase the amount of ultraviolet light.

What is the reason of British occupation in India? What was the actual intention of the British to invade India? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They are both asking for the reasons and intentions behind the British occupation and invasion of India. Let me provide an answer to these questions. The primary reasons for the British occupation in India are rooted in trade, economic interests, and asserting political power. Step 1: Identify the origin of British involvement in India - The British East India Company was established in 1600, with the main objective of carrying out trade with the Indian subcontinent, primarily in textiles, spices, and other exotic goods. Step 2: Understand how the Company's role in India evolved - Over time, the British East India Company gained territorial control in India and developed political power after winning a series of battles, notably the Battle of Plassey (1757) and the Battle of Buxar (1764). This enabled them to establish their foothold in the country. Step 3: Analyze the motivations behind the occupation - There were several reasons for the British interest in occupying India, including: 1. Economic gains: India possessed vast resources and a large consumer market that provided the British with lucrative trade opportunities. 2. Geopolitical power: The British wanted to protect their trade routes to Asia, secure their foothold in India, and prevent other European powers from gaining influence in the region. 3. Cultural superiority and civilizing mission: The British believed they had the moral responsibility to bring their culture, language, and institutions to India, assuming that they would be improving the lives of the Indian population. In summary, while both questions inquire about the same topic, the British occupation in India can be attributed to a combination of economic interests, geopolitical power, and a perceived cultural superiority."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Molecules of tRNA bring amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence.

Computers, satellites, telecommunications, lasers, televisions and nuclear power all owe their invention to ways in which Einstein exposed a stranger and more complicated reality underneath the world. He escaped Hitler's Germany and devoted the rest of his life to human rights and peace with an authority unmatched by any scientist today, or even most politicians and religious leaders. He spoke out against fascism and racial prejudice. His FBI file ran 1,400 pages.

The multi-millionaire is estimated to be the wealthiest living artist, but believes he remains true to his artistic integrity. \\"I've always tried to be in the situation where money's a by-product of what I'm trying to do. No matter how big the money gets, you always have to make sure you're not using the art to chase the money, you're using the money to chase the art,\\" he says. \\"I've always been able to take all the money in the bank and put it on one sculpture.\\" Entitled \\"For Heaven's Sake\\" the platinum and pink diamond-studded infant's skull is the glistening centerpiece of Hirst's latest exhibition at Hong Kong's new Gagosian Gallery. Displayed alongside a series of photorealistic butterflies, it's a more upbeat show that perhaps he's known for. \\"I just wanted to show things I've been working on more recently. There are a few things from 2008. We just had a crazy financial meltdown so I thought I'd do a show that's a bit more optimistic than my usual shows.\\" Hirst has never been far from controversy -- his earlier work has included dead animals suspended in formaldehyde -- and he's equally happy to go against convention in the business side of the art world. In 2008 he took a gamble by auctioning his work rather than going though a dealer. It paid off making 198 million, but Hirst is modest about the move. \\"Lots of people say I was a genius and I was very clever when I did that. But I think it was luck,\\" he says. \\"Another week later and it could have failed miserably. It was sort of an idiotic move in a way. I say 'phew' rather than 'genius'.\\" Some have also criticized Hirst, like many other big name artists, for not actually making much of his own work. The diamond-encrusted skull was made by London jewelers Bentley & Skinners and the butterfly pictures produced by Hirst's artisans. \\"People have always said things like that, and no matter how many times I answer the question people will always go but you didn't make it,\\" he says. \\"(It's my work) only in the same way that a Frank Gehry can be described as a Frank Gehry house.

Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death. Question: When was Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee?","completion":"Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee was in 1977. A Silver Jubilee is a big celebration that happens when someone has been a leader, like a queen, for 25 years. In this case, it's about Queen Elizabeth II having been queen for 25 years at that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What will Hercules the Second eat? from the following article ? The Steptoes have retired their horse - because the horse is lame, after having to pull the cart (and Harold) home from York, after the horse walked into the back of a removal van which then drove off - and plan to buy a new one with Albert's life savings of £80, putting £9 away for \\"emergencies\\". Harold sends Albert home and returns several hours later drunk and introduces Hercules the Second, a short sighted racing greyhound. Harold reveals to Albert that he purchased this from local gangster and loan shark Frankie Barrow for the £80 plus a further £200 owing on top. Furthermore, he plans to pay a small fortune to keep it fed on egg and steak. They eventually have to sell all of their possessions to have one final bet on their dog at the races to try to pay off the money they owe. When their dog loses, they just about lose hope when Albert brings up that he had saved £1,000 in a life insurance policy. Harold then schemes to get the money from his father by faking his death. They find an old mannequin among their collection of junk and fit it around Albert's body. They then call Dr. Popplewell, a known alcoholic doctor, who's drunk at the time of seeing Albert and he announces that Albert has died. Harold then brings home a coffin that he has been saving for the inevitable day that his father would actually die.

States look at corporate plates to help with deficits By Katharine Lackey, USA TODAY Michael Coburn of Allen, Texas, has been a RE/Max agent for 23 years, so when a license plate with the company's red, white and blue balloon logo became available at the end of last year, he bought one for himself that reads MRREMX and one for his wife, Debra, MSREMX. \\"It's a really good marketing strategy,\\" he says, adding that a buyer chose him as a Realtor after seeing his plate. \\"Everybody likes to show pride in their company, and it gets you business.\\" Facing another year of budget cuts, some cash-strapped states are looking at corporate logo license plates as a way to add dollars to their coffers. Texas became the first to sell corporate license plates last November, says Kim Drummond, spokeswoman for My Plates, which produces the plates for the state. Legislators in Illinois and Florida have proposed similar programs, and Virginia is looking at a program of special plates for business fleets registered in the state. Drummond says three companies will join RE/Max in making corporate logo plates available in Texas on Wednesday: Ford; Mighty Fine Burgers, an Austin-based eatery; and Vestas, a wind energy company. Since its inception, My Plates has sold more than 28,000 license plates. Through Nov. 3, sales of the plates had raised about 2.1 million for the state's general revenue fund, Drummond says. At least 35% of the sales goes to the general revenue fund, she says. Prices range from 55 for a plate with a background design and a random combination of letters and numbers to 595 for a 10-year plate with a background design and any combination of six letters and/or numbers, Drummond says. \\"Everybody is very clear that the idea is to help the state with its deficit,\\" she says. That's what representatives in Illinois and Florida had in mind when they made proposals that stalled this year. Florida state Sen. Mike Fasano, a Republican, introduced legislation in March that would have created a corporate license plate program and provided drivers who purchased the plates at least a 50% reduction in their annual plate fee, with the corporations footing the bill, Fasano says. The bill died in conference committee, he says. He is considering whether to reintroduce it in the next legislative session. \\"At a time when people are struggling, it would be a great opportunity for (drivers) to have a choice of having a corporate logo and, at the same time, save a significant amount every year,\\" Fasano says. Florida state Sen. Lee Constantine, a Republican, says he voted against the bill, as he does nearly all license plate bills, because it's \\"ridiculous\\" in Florida. He says there are already too many specialty plates in the state. A similar bill introduced in February by Illinois state Rep. Joseph Lyons, a Democrat, also would have provided a discount for vehicle owners who purchased corporate plates, but the bill died in committee, Lyons says. He plans to make the bill a higher priority this session. \\"In an environment where every state is looking to put something back into its coffers, everything is on the playing field,\\" he says. \\"Let's listen to any idea that might bring some revenue to the state.\\" In Texas, companies must pay 5,000 in fees per design, and 10% of the plates' proceeds can either go to a charity or, in Ford's case, toward licensing its brand name, Drummond says. For RE/Max plates, 10% of proceeds goes toward the Children's Miracle Network, says Charles El-Moussa, chief operating officer and general counsel at RE/Max of Texas. For Mighty Fine Burgers, the corporate logo license plate is a chance for customers to show their loyalty, says Allison Dreiband, public relations specialist for the company. In return, customers who get the plates will receive 100 worth of burger bucks for every year they have the plates on their cars, she says. •Virginia. Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell's Commission on Government Reform and Restructuring recommended allowing the state Department of Motor Vehicles to offer special plates with company logos for business fleets within the state or registered there, according to the commission's Oct. 15 report. The commission plans to issue an additional report Dec. 1. More than 350 businesses have fleets in the state for a total of 130,000 vehicles that would be eligible, says Melanie Stokes, Virginia DMV spokeswoman. Corporations would be charged a one-time fee ranging from 4,000 to 4,500, depending on the size of the fleet, bringing potential revenue of more than 1 million. •Nebraska. In 2009, the Legislature passed a bill to allow non-profit organizations to apply for specialty license plates through the state DMV. The program, which will enter its first year Jan. 1, requires companies to provide 500 prepaid applications — a total of 35,000 at 70 per plate — to be considered, says Dusty Vaughan, legal counsel for the Nebraska Legislature's Transportation Committee. In 2009, the state raised about 600,000 through the sale of its Huskers plate. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Vacuum tube: A vacuum tube is an electronic component that controls electric current, and it is found within devices like televisions and computers, but it is not a device that measures things itself. b. Television: A television is a device that displays moving images, but it is primarily a consumer device for entertainment and media, not meant for measurement purposes. c.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Frogs. Frogs, as a type of amphibian, undergo a unique process during their life cycle that causes them to transition from breathing with gills as larvae to breathing with lungs as adults. The development of frogs begins with eggs that are laid in water, which hatch into larvae commonly known as tadpoles. Tadpoles are aquatic creatures that possess gills to help them extract oxygen from the water, which enables them to survive in their underwater environment. As tadpoles begin to grow and mature, they undergo a metamorphosis process that entails various physiological transformations. One significant aspect of this metamorphosis is the transition from gills to lungs for the purpose of respiration. During metamorphosis, the gills of a tadpole begin to disappear, and the development of lungs commences. Once transformation is complete, the lungs become fully functional, allowing adult frogs to breathe air from the atmosphere. This adaptation is crucial for the survival of adult frogs, as their habitat typically includes both aquatic and terrestrial environments. In addition to frogs, other amphibians such as salamanders and newts also experience similar transitions in their life cycle, allowing them to breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults. This particular characteristic sets amphibians apart from other groups of animals, such as reptiles, birds, and mammals, which typically rely on one mode of respiration throughout their entire lives. Returning to the provided answer choices, we can eliminate salmon, as they are fish and primarily rely on gills for oxygen exchange in both their juvenile and adult stages. Parasites vary in their respiratory systems depending on the species, but they generally do not follow the same pattern as amphibians (gills as larvae and lungs as adults). Whales, mice, and tortoises are all vertebrates that belong to different animal groups (mammals, reptiles) and do not possess gills at any stage of their development. The provided answer \\"a fish\\" is too vague and does not take into account the unique characteristics of amphibians. And finally, air is not an appropriate answer, as it is not an organism. Based on the information provided and the process of elimination, the best answer to the question \\"What breathes with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults.\\" is frogs, as they are representative of the amphibian group that undergoes this unique respiratory transition throughout their life cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Answer:","completion":"Jason has more abnormal cells in his body. The paragraph states that Jason has cancer, which is a disease characterized by abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably due to mutations. In contrast, Charlotte does not have cancer, but she has high blood pressure. Therefore, Jason has more abnormal cells than Charlotte."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After his failed attempt at flirting with the pretty girl, Bill returned to the booth where Teddy was sitting. Frustrated and fueled by the alcohol they have consumed, the two friends started to engage in a lively conversation. They discussed how they believed some pretty girls to be stuck up. With each word, their voices grew louder, drawing the attention of patrons in the bar. Teddy, trying to support his friend, chimed in with stories of his own. They both shared stories of unsuccessful attempts at talking to pretty girls in the past and how they felt judged and dismissed by these women. As the night went on, their conversation evolved from bemoaning the stuck-up nature of pretty girls to discussing their own insecurities and past heartbreaks. They touched upon how societal expectations and the pressure to find a partner affected their self-esteem and approach to dating. The exploration of their own vulnerabilities revealed different layers to their relationship, allowing them to grow closer as friends. However, unbeknownst to them, the pretty girl who Bill had tried to flirt with earlier was sitting at a nearby table, overhearing their entire conversation. She couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt at having been the catalyst for such negative discussion. Although she had been caught off-guard by Bill's drunken state, she now understood that his actions were likely a result of his own anxieties and pressure to impress her. As the night began to wind down, and the boys paid their tab, the pretty girl approached them and offered an apology for her earlier behavior. Caught off-guard, Bill and Teddy listened intently as she explained her perspective on their conversation. They discovered that judging others based on appearances or a single interaction can lead to misunderstandings and unnecessary animosity. Ultimately, the pretty girl suggested they start fresh and get to know each other without any preconceived notions about who they might be. The three of them exchanged numbers, with the hopes of meeting up again on a night when Bill wouldn't be too drunk to communicate effectively. This chance encounter between Bill, Teddy, and the pretty girl taught them valuable lessons about assumptions, empathy, and the importance of open communication in relationships. It served as a reminder that everyone has their struggles and insecurities, and the way we treat each other can have a profound impact on how others perceive us in return."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Toward a More Secure Retirement As one who has long been involved with retirement plans as a consultant to large employers, I have seen 401(k)’s morph from their intended role as supplements to traditional pension plans to become the primary retirement vehicle for most American workers. Your reference to the need for 401(k) improvements and new savings accounts with shared risks overlooks the more pressing need for a retirement plan that will provide guaranteed lifelong income that keeps pace with inflation. Such a retirement plan has existed for over 70 years: Social Security. As 401(k)’s have tanked and private pensions vanished, Social Security remains the only reliable plan for future retirees and their families. Federal dollars will be much better spent enhancing Social Security, especially for lower-income Americans, than subsidizing new forms of individual savings that have proved ineffective. William J. Arnone New York, Jan. 26, 2009 Your editorial portrays the “grim reality” facing retirees: an uncertain financial market, inadequate savings and employer contributions, shift of all risks to workers (investment, longevity) and so on. And the solutions are unsatisfactorily focused on patching up existing arrangements. Fortunately, a superb answer is available: Simply expand Social Security to provide a benefit to replace 70 percent of average pay rather than the current 41 percent. Consider: It’s already set up as a national plan, does not depend on anyone’s investment acumen, avoids financial chicanery, has expenses that are ridiculously low, provides longevity and cost-of-living guarantees, and has built-in job portability. And the increase in cost may be surprisingly small; it will be offset by many factors, including raising the taxable wage base, use of a large part of the current 2.4 trillion surplus, and folding in the assets of existing plans by a reasonable trade-off. Definitely worth thinking about. David Langer New York, Jan. 27, 2009 The writer is a consulting actuary. Your editorial recommended “helping people manage their retirement withdrawals so that the money lasts a lifetime.” But mandatory minimum withdrawals forbid that. While the life expectancy tables that the government uses ensure that a retiree will not run out, if she lives past 85 she will not have enough to live on either. Mandatory minimum withdrawals should be eliminated or, at the very least, drastically reduced. Bernice G. Rosenthal New York, Jan. 26, 2009 “From Here to Retirement” was right to point out the damage done to people with retirement plans who are unluckily approaching retirement now. A point not touched on was the even more serious situation facing the millions who may have been decently employed for years, but who were laid off their principal jobs after age 50. Because employers have been tacitly licensed to discriminate against older workers, most can expect little chance of re-employment in a job with a retirement plan, or even at a wage sufficient to permit any savings. Many must make do for years with inadequate self-employment, underemployment, or worse. When they reach retirement age, their savings, home equity and other resources will already be depleted or gone. In the face of this catastrophe, these workers have typically been counseled to cope by downsizing their employment expectations — which is the opposite of a solution. There seems to be no political attention, or even much social research, directed toward this pressing issue. The problem seems invisible now, but soon America is going to be trying to figure out how to cope with the plight of millions of baby boomers trying to live on nothing but Social Security checks. Stephen Lathrop Hull, Mass., Jan. 26, 2009 Plummeting unrealized 401(k) account balances make great headlines. And they provide a platform for critics of these plans to condemn them. But the media and government policy makers should realize that these plans are caught in the same financial crisis that has paralyzed business and financial organizations throughout the world. Participants in 401(k) plans have suffered along with everyone else. Working in partnership with employers, participants can successfully manage normal market risks and cycles and accumulate ample assets for retirement. But they cannot succeed without efficient and transparent capital markets. The drop in 401(k) account balances in 2008 was not caused by a defect in the 401(k) system or by ignorant participants. Inadequate enforcement, reckless conduct and unethical behavior in the capital markets are the problem, not 401(k) plans. Policy makers should direct their efforts to ensuring that a similar market collapse never again occurs. Plan participants, as well as all other investors, will then be able to move confidently forward, knowing that saving and investing for the long term will pay off as expected.

Given the question: Given the below context: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club. Guess a valid title for it! The answer is:","completion":"\\"Life and Musical Career of Boult: From Childhood to University Years\\" Justifying this, I have looked at the main focus of the context provided.

This is especially important if you are new to magnetic false eyelashes as you will apply them less gracefully when initially using them. Put all your other makeup on first before applying your magnetic false eyelashes. Possible answers: --Get the right look by putting the magnetic false eyelashes on right before applying the false lashes. Pin or glue the false eyelashes on using an eyelash glue (e.g. --You can also put some pink serum into your eyebrow hair to cover up any eye color before you have the actual real affect done on your real lashes. Consider using petroleum jelly or lip gloss. --Look in the mirror with your magnetic false eyelashes. Gently lift your eyelashes up and over your brow. --Otherwise, the lashes could smudge your other makeup during the application process. Apply mascara to the inside corners of your natural lashes. Answer:","completion":"First, it is essential to prepare your magnetic false eyelashes and gather the necessary tools for application. Start by selecting the appropriate magnetic false eyelashes that complement your eye shape and desired look. Magnetic eyelashes usually come in a kit containing two sets of upper and lower lashes with small magnets attached at the edge. Before applying your magnetic false eyelashes, ensure that your face is clean, and all your other makeup is already applied. This helps prevent any smudging or disturbances during the magnetic false eyelash application process. Next, carefully remove the magnetic false eyelashes from their case using a pair of tweezers. Be gentle, as you don't want to damage the lashes or the small magnets attached to them. As you handle the eyelashes, make sure to identify which lashes go on the upper eyelid and which go on the lower eyelid. The upper eyelash will usually be slightly longer than the lower one. Now, position yourself in front of a mirror with good lighting. This helps ensure proper placement and alignment of the magnetic false eyelashes. Begin by applying the upper magnetic false eyelash. To do this, use your fingers or tweezers to hold the upper lash just above your natural eyelashes, aligning the inner corner of the lash with the inner corner of your eye. Take your time adjusting the placement until you are satisfied with the positioning. After the upper lash is in place, it's time to apply the lower magnetic false eyelash. Holding the lower lash with your fingers or tweezers, gently position it under your natural eyelashes so that the magnets align with the ones on the upper lash. The magnets should click together, securing the magnetic false eyelashes in place. If necessary, adjust the lashes until they are comfortable and blend seamlessly with your natural eyelashes. To complete the look and enhance the hold of your magnetic false eyelashes, apply a coat of mascara to the inside corners of your natural lashes. This helps to blend your natural lashes with the false ones, ensuring a more seamless and attractive appearance. In conclusion, wearing magnetic false eyelashes can significantly enhance your look while being comfortable and easy to use. By following these steps, you can enjoy stunning, full lashes without the need for messy glue or adhesive and with minimal interference to your other makeup."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: I can use this background: Fish mortality is a parameter used in fisheries population dynamics to account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. The mortality can be divided into two types: Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models. Now, I have a new situation: Two lakes had been stocked with fish two years before.Blue lake had an abundant fish stock because nobody fished there, but Green lake was open for fishing. Blue lake had some polution and disease problems. Answer this question please: Which lake had a higher fishing mortality last year? The answer is:","completion":"Green lake had a higher fishing mortality last year. Step 1: Identify the factors affecting fish mortality in each lake. - Blue lake has natural mortality factors such as pollution and disease. - Green lake is open for fishing, implying that it has fishing mortality. Step 2: Determine the type of mortality to compare. - The question asks for \\"fishing mortality,\\" which only involves the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities. Step 3: Compare the fishing mortality between the two lakes. - Since Blue lake has no fishing activities, its fishing mortality is zero or negligible. - Green lake has fishing activities, which directly contribute to its fishing mortality. In conclusion, based on the available information, Green lake had a higher fishing mortality last year due to it being open for fishing, while Blue lake had no mention of fishing activities taking place."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Options: a ) 120 , b ) 150 , c ) 180 , d ) 200 , e ) 250 A:","completion":"First, let's understand what the task is asking. We need to find the value of x, which represents the total school population. Here are the given information and guidelines: 1. 120 students represent x percent of the boys at a school. 2. The boys at the school make up 30% of the total school population of x students. Now, let's break it down into simple steps to find the value of x: Step 1: Convert the given data into equations. Let B represent the total number of boys in the school and T represent the total school population. From guideline 1, we can form the equation: 120 = (x/100) * B From guideline 2, we can form the equation: B = 0.30 * T Step 2: Find the value of x. We need to find the value of T, so we will first eliminate B from the equations. a) Using equation from guideline 2, we can say: B = 0.30 * T b) Substitute this value of B in the equation from guideline 1: 120 = (x/100) * (0.30 * T) c) Now, we will solve the equation for T: 120 = 0.30 * (x/100) * T 120 * (100/x) = 0.30 * T T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * x) Step 3: Check each option to find the value of x that satisfies the equation. a) x = 120, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 120) = 400 (Total school population) b) x = 150, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 150) = 267.67 (This is not a whole number, so it's not feasible) c) x = 180, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 180) = 222.22 (This is not a whole number, so it's not feasible) d) x = 200, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 200) = 200 (Total school population) e) x = 250, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 250) = 160 (Total school population) Step 4: Select the correct answer.

During lithification, the compacted sediment layers undergo a few processes that transform them into a solid rock. These processes include: 1. Compaction: As the layers of sediment continue to accumulate, the weight of the overlying sediment presses down on the layers below, causing them to become more compact and expelling water from between the particles. 2. Cementation: Mineral-rich water from the surrounding environment seeps through the sediment layers, depositing minerals like silica, calcite, and iron oxide. These minerals act as a binding agent, cementing the sediment particles together to form a solid rock.

Is \\"Paris was reunited with its suburbs on January 1, 2016 when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.\\" a good answer to the question \\"When was Paris reunited with its suburbs?\\"","completion":"Yes, the given statement \\"Paris was reunited with its suburbs on January 1, 2016 when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.\\" is a good answer to the question \\"When was Paris reunited with its suburbs?\\" However, it can be expanded to provide more context and understand the significance of this milestone. Paris, which is at the heart of the Île-de-France region, has long been the capital city of France and a world-renowned hub for culture, art, business, and diplomacy. Over time, the Greater Paris area has expanded beyond the city proper, encompassing numerous suburban areas surrounding the metropolitan core. These suburbs are home to a significant part of the population, as well as businesses and institutions. Before the establishment of the Métropole du Grand Paris, these suburbs shared a connection with Paris, but they had different administrative structures and were not under a single unified governance structure. The idea of creating a unified metropolitan area covering both Paris and its suburbs has been contemplated since the 19th century, but it took several debates, government proposals, and legal acts before it could materialize. One of the key motivations behind the Métropole du Grand Paris was to create an integrated urban area where major issues such as transportation, housing, and economic development could be approached holistically by a single authority in lieu of having numerous competing local bodies. On January 1, 2016, the Métropole du Grand Paris was officially inaugurated, bringing 131 communes together, including Paris and the surrounding suburban locales. This represents about 7.2 million inhabitants and an area of over 800 square kilometers. The establishment of the Métropole du Grand Paris effectively reunited Paris with its suburbs under one administrative umbrella, streamlining decision making and promoting a more integrated approach to tackling the various social, economic, and environmental challenges faced by the region. As a result, the Métropole du Grand Paris now serves as a framework for cooperation among the constituent communes, fostering collective strategic planning and projects spanning multiple fields, including urban planning, social housing, transport infrastructure, environmental policies, and economic development initiatives. This historic merger of Paris and its surrounding suburbs has amplified the city's global influence, boosting its attractiveness to international businesses, investors, and tourists alike. In summary, the statement is accurate and succinctly answers the question, but to provide a detailed and long answer, it's helpful to integrate additional information that explains the background, reasons, motivations, and outcomes of the establishment of the Métropole du Grand Paris."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Turkish people (), or the Turks (), also known as Anatolian Turks (), are a Turkic ethnic group and nation living mainly in Turkey and speaking Turkish, the most widely spoken Turkic language. They are the largest ethnic group in Turkey, as well as by far the largest ethnic group among the speakers of Turkic languages. Ethnic Turkish minorities exist in the former lands of the Ottoman Empire. In addition, a Turkish diaspora has been established with modern migration, particularly in Western Europe. The ethnonym \\"Turk\\" may be first discerned in Herodotus' (c. 484–425 BC) reference to Targitas, first king of the Scythians; furthermore, during the first century AD., Pomponius Mela refers to the \\"Turcae\\" in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the \\"Tyrcae\\" among the people of the same area. The first definite references to the \\"Turks\\" come mainly from Chinese sources in the sixth century. In these sources, \\"Turk\\" appears as \\"Tujue\\" (), which referred to the Göktürks. Although \\"Turk\\" refers to Turkish people, it may also sometimes refer to the wider language group of Turkic peoples. In the 19th century, the word \\"Türk\\" only referred to Anatolian villagers. The Ottoman ruling class identified themselves as Ottomans, not usually as Turks. In the late 19th century, as the Ottoman upper classes adopted European ideas of nationalism the term \\"Türk\\" took on a much more positive connotation.

Hypothesis: If you don't distinguish between the categories the manager won't accept those files. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis might not be necessarily entailed by the premise but possesses a connection. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis and analyze the relationship between them. Premise: The presence requirement is a vital aspect of certain immigration and labor laws. It focuses on distinguishing between different categories of immigrants, particularly the unrestricted aliens and H-2A workers. Unrestricted aliens are those individuals who have entered a country on a permanent or temporary basis, including tourists, students, and business visitors, unrestricted by any government regulations or quota-based systems. In contrast, H-2A workers are foreign workers who are allowed to enter and work temporarily within a country, such as the United States, under specific government regulations for agricultural work. The distinction between these categories is imperative because each group holds distinct legal rights, responsibilities, and obligations. For instance, H-2A workers are subject to rules concerning wages, work hours, and living conditions, while unrestricted aliens may not be subject to such regulations. Moreover, H-2A workers may only work for a predetermined employer and period, whereas unrestricted aliens generally have more flexibility in these matters. Hypothesis: Failure to distinguish between unrestricted aliens and H-2A workers may lead to improper file handling or incorrect record-keeping by a manager. It implies that if the categories are not explicitly separated and treated according to their unique characteristics and legal regulations, the manager in charge of handling and processing these documents might not accept them. This could result in complications in the legal and immigration proceedings as well as potential penalties for the entities involved. Connection: The connection between the premise and the hypothesis highlights the importance of the presence requirement. The premise argues that differentiating between unrestricted aliens and H-2A workers is essential because they are subject to contrasting regulations and obligations. The hypothesis, on the other hand, takes it a step further by suggesting that improper categorization of these groups might lead to the manager refusing to accept relevant files. Although the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, it provides a valid context for showcasing the consequences of not following the premise's assertion. Therefore, while not necessarily entailed by the premise, the hypothesis does share a core connection: neglecting to distinguish between the unrestricted aliens and H-2A workers can have repercussions, potentially leading to managers refusing to accept improperly categorized files. Maintaining this distinction ensures the appropriate handling of each category, promoting accurate record-keeping, and adherence to legal obligations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nine new regional control rooms were built in England as part of a £423m project to regionalise the service. But the centres are standing empty, at a cost of £1m rent a month, because of problems with their computers and may now not all be needed. The coalition government has decided not to proceed with regionalisation. BBC Radio Four's Face the Facts also found that expensive equipment bought by fire brigades to replace current engines remained unused. The nine regional centres were built as part of plans to replace 46 local fire control rooms in England, with an original budget of £70m, and create a national interlinked service that could direct fire brigades to the scenes of large emergencies more easily. However, under new coalition government plans, the 46 local centres will still be replaced, but there will no longer be regionalised local fire brigades; instead they will remain under local control. The nine centres have been standing empty for up to three years because of problems in developing their computer systems. The monthly rent for the empty buildings is costing taxpayers £1m a month, and they will not be all in use until 2013, sending the programme more than £350m over budget. Defence contractor EADS was hired in 2007 to install the computer systems in the centres, as well as in 1,400 fire stations and 3,400 fire engines, providing an interlinked response service. Labour MP Clive Betts, the current chairman of the Commons communities and local government select committee that has investigated the delays, said the project had been \\"almost an unmitigated disaster throughout the course of its life\\". \\"But the reality was that, when you consider cancellation costs, it was less costly to continue with it than it was to cancel it,\\" he said. The select committee criticised the government for having a high turnover of staff working on the project and a reliance on consultants. John McDonnell MP, chairman of the Fire Brigades Union parliamentary group, agreed that the waste could have been prevented. The planned nine regional centres and the 46 local fire and rescue service control rooms to be regionalised: \\"It is almost Yes Minister-ish. It is very difficult for senior civil servants, ministers and secretaries of state to admit they have made a mistake,\\" he said. \\"What usually happens is rather than admit a mistake they throw more money at it and try to save the phenomenon.\\" EADS admitted the project had \\"birth pangs\\", but said it was now on course. As part of money-saving proposals, EADS has recommended that the project could be carried out using fewer regional centres. Its chief executive Robin Southwell said: \\"We believe the number can come down significantly, saving maybe hundreds of millions of pounds. \\"Any of those buildings not being used could be adapted for other uses.\\" The government has so far not responded to EADS' proposals. BBC Radio Four's Face the Facts also found that some brigades in the UK are selling unused, brand new fire engines. Central Scotland fire brigade bought two combined aerial rescue pumps (Carp engines) in 2008 at £400,000 each, which it later found were too heavy for UK roads. Chief fire officer for Central Scotland Kenny Taylor said: \\"Very early on it became clear there was a problem. When the engine became kitted it was substantially overweight.\\" Central Scotland has now put the engines up for sale on the internet at just under 300,000 euros (£246,000) each. The manufacturers are in dispute with the fire brigade, saying the vehicles were made to the right specification. They believe they are not being used because of internal problems in the fire brigade. They suggested a solution for the use of the vehicles, but have not had a response. But other brigades have had problems with this type of new vehicle, supplied by different manufacturers. Humberside fire brigade spent almost £60,000 converting its Carp engine back to a single rescue platform fire engine and does not know when it will come into service. South Yorkshire, which brought four Carps in 2008, has sent them to the Netherlands for £600,000 worth of remedial work. The manufacturers of its vehicles have gone into administration. The fire minister Bob Neill told Face the Facts: \\"The government is committed to ensuring value-for-money for the taxpayer and better procurement is vital.\\" The president of the Chief Fire Officers' Association, John Bonney, is frustrated, blaming the government and contractors. \\"There has got to be a bit of a knocking of heads together,\\" he said. \\"It is not just money but it's been investment of a lot of time and energy by the fire and rescue service. We feel exhausted and disappointed. \\"Unfortunately, certainly at the early stages... it became a discussion between the primary contractor and government officials rather than the professionals.\\" Listen to Face the Facts on BBC Radio 4 at 1230 BST, on Thursday, 26 August, repeated at 2100 BST on Sunday, 29 August, or on BBC iPlayer What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about a project in England that intended to build nine new regional control rooms for fire services, replacing 46 local fire control rooms.

So, we will move 226293 to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: 2022 * n = -64875 - 226293 2022 * n = -291168 Now, to find \\"n\\", we will divide both sides of the equation by 2022: n = -291168 / 2022 n = -144 So the solution to the equation is n = -144.

Options are: --Yes; --No; Answer:","completion":"Yes, \\"sneaky\\" can be considered a valid answer to describe Kendall in this situation. Allow me to explain the reasoning behind this choice. The term \\"sneaky\\" is typically used to refer to someone who exhibits deceptive, secretive, or underhanded behavior. In this particular scenario, Kendall took your money from your wallet after you explicitly told him to leave it alone. This action indicates that he deliberately went against your wishes and engaged in a deceitful and dishonest act. Kendall's behavior can be characterized as sneaky because he chose to take your money in a secretive manner, likely without your immediate knowledge or consent.

This type of behavior aligns with the definition of the word \\"sneaky.\\" It is important to remember that this evaluation of Kendall's actions is based on the given information, and it may not reflect his overall character. People can exhibit specific traits or behaviors in certain situations without these being their defining qualities.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. Roland was a: A. Prisoner B. not enough information C. Record keeper D. Knight A:","completion":"D. Knight In the given passage, Roland is portrayed as a knight. Several key details and plot elements in the excerpt support this conclusion. For instance, Roland is said to have waited in a camp with other crusaders during the grace period permitted under the terms of surrender, indicating his participation in the crusade as a combatant rather than a non-combatant role such as a prisoner or record keeper. Furthermore, Roland is depicted as having a longsword and dagger, which are traditional weapons associated with knights in historical and medieval literature. He bears these weapons as he is expected to do so, indicating that he is fulfilling the role of a knight. The fact that he was able to volunteer to help escort the prisoners to their execution also suggests that Roland holds a position of relative authority and duty, another characteristic commonly linked with the role of a knight. Moreover, the fact that he does not opt to wear his helmet and mail shirt, choosing instead to leave these items in his tent, suggests an acknowledgment of the inherent risk his position entails, but also reveals a certain degree of protection he possesses, another element consistent with knightly status. Roland is primarily concerned with bearing witness to the events taking place, a perspective that aligns more with that of a knight placed in a position of responsibility, rather than a record keeper or a prisoner. In summary, through his thoughts, actions, and the duties he performs throughout the passage, Roland fits the role of a knight, so the answer is D. Knight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is an enchanting and unique city situated in northeastern Italy, in the Veneto region. Venice has long been known for its intricate network of canals and bridges, which replace traditional streets and serve as the primary means of transportation throughout the city. Venice is built across 118 small islands separated by around 150 canals, linked by more than 400 bridges. These canals play a pivotal role in daily life, facilitating travel and commerce within the city. The Grand Canal, also known as Canalasso, is the largest and most iconic of all, acting as the main thoroughfare for traffic and running in an S-shape through the heart of Venice. The diverse range of watercraft that cruise the canal includes gondolas, vaporettos (water buses), water taxis, and various types of cargo vessels. The city's intricate layout and picturesque canals are part of what make it a popular tourist destination. Visitors can expect to see historic architecture, captivating art, and a vibrant culture that has evolved over centuries. Some of the must-see tourist attractions in Venice include Saint Mark's Square (Piazza San Marco), Saint Mark's Basilica, Doge's Palace, Rialto Bridge, and the Bridge of Sighs. In contrast, the other options provided – Michigan, New York, and Amsterdam – are not located in Southern Europe. Michigan and New York are U.S. states, while Amsterdam is a city in the Netherlands, a country in Northwestern Europe. Although Amsterdam is also famous for its canals, it does not fit the geographical requirement specified in the question.

Translate to English","completion":"Of course, we do not want to return to a situation where animal proteins from the same species end up in animal feed. The statement above highlights the concern of preventing a situation where animals are fed proteins derived from their own species. This issue came to prominence during the late 20th century when the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) crisis, commonly known as Mad Cow Disease, emerged. BSE is a neurodegenerative disorder that is fatal for cows and can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated beef, leading to a condition known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). The BSE crisis had a significant impact on the cattle industry and public health. It originally arose from the practice of feeding cattle with meat and bone meal (MBM) that contained proteins derived from the remains of other cattle and possibly sheep. This practice persisted because it was a cost-effective way to enhance the protein content of cattle feed and promote growth, but it ultimately led to disastrous consequences for both cattle and human health as the BSE prion could spread through the feed. To prevent such a situation from occurring again, strict regulations have been implemented in many countries to avoid the feeding of animal by-products back to the same species. These regulations include the removal of specified risk materials (SRMs) from animal feed, which are the parts of animals known to contain high levels of prions, such as brains and spinal cords. In addition, the practice of using animal by-products in feed production has been regulated, and in some cases, banned. For example, the European Union has put in place regulations that prohibit the use of processed animal proteins (PAPs) from mammals in the feed of farmed animals. The ban initially covered all farmed animals but has gradually been eased for certain species such as poultry and pigs under strict risk assessment and controls. Furthermore, traceability and controls throughout the feed production chain have been enhanced to ensure that feed is not contaminated with animal proteins from the same species. This involves rigorous monitoring of feed manufacturers and suppliers, clear labeling of feeds containing animal proteins, and the regular inspection of farms to ensure compliance with feed regulations. Overall, the goal is to ensure food security and protect public health by eliminating the risk of diseases such as BSE, while also addressing ethical concerns surrounding the use of animal proteins in feed. By focusing on strict regulatory measures, enhanced traceability and controls, and research into alternative protein sources such as plant-based proteins, it is possible to prevent a return to the untenable situation of using animal proteins from the same species in feed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe. - The Lake District, also known as the Lakes or Lakeland, is a mountainous region in North-West England. A popular holiday destination, it is famous for its lakes, forests and mountains (or \\"fells\\") and its associations with the early 19th century writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets. - Thirlmere is a reservoir in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria and the English Lake District. It runs roughly south to north and is bordered on the eastern side by the A591 road and on the western side by a minor road. It occupies the site of two former natural lakes (or - on a different analysis - a single lake with a narrow fordable waist). In the 19th century Manchester Corporation constructed a dam at the northern end, raising the water level, flooding the valley bottom, and creating a reservoir to provide the growing industrial city of Manchester with water supplies via the 96 mile-long Thirlmere Aqueduct. The reservoir and the aqueduct still provide water to the Manchester area. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Old Norse was a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during about the 9th to 13th centuries. - A fell (from Old Norse \\"fell\\", \\"fjall\\", \\"mountain\\") is a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain range or moor-covered hills. The term is most often employed in Fennoscandia, the Isle of Man, parts of Northern England, and Scotland. - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north. - Helvellyn (\\"pale yellow moorland\\") is a mountain in the English Lake District, the highest point of the Helvellyn range, a north-south line of mountains to the north of Ambleside, between the lakes of Thirlmere and Ullswater. - Catstye Cam is a fell in the English Lake District . It is an outlier of Helvellyn in the Eastern Fells . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - The Lake Poets were a group of English poets who all lived in the Lake District of England, United Kingdom, at the turn of the nineteenth century. As a group, they followed no single \\"school\\" of thought or literary practice then known. They were named, only to be uniformly disparaged, by the \\"Edinburgh Review\\". They are considered part of the Romantic Movement. - Ullswater is the second largest lake in the English Lake District, being approximately nine miles (14.5 kilometres) long and 0.75 miles (1,200 m) wide with a maximum depth of slightly more than . Many regard Ullswater as the most beautiful of the English lakes; it has been compared to Lake Lucerne in Switzerland and it is a popular tourist destination. It is a typical Lake District narrow \\"ribbon lake\\" formed after the last ice age when a glacier scooped out the valley floor and when the glacier retreated, the deepened section filled with meltwater which became a lake. A total of three separate glaciers formed the lake. The surrounding mountains give Ullswater the shape of a stretched 'Z' with three distinct segments (or 'reaches') that wend their way through the surrounding hills. - William Wordsworth (7 April 1770 23 April 1850) was a major English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication \\"Lyrical Ballads\\" (1798). - Ambleside is a town in Cumbria, in North West England. Historically within the county of Westmorland, it is situated at the head of Windermere, England's largest water. The town is within the Lake District National Park. - The Eastern Fells are a group of hills in the English Lake District. Centred on Helvellyn they primarily comprise a northsouth ridge running between Ullswater and Lakeland's Central Valley. - The Helvellyn range is the name given to a part of the Eastern Fells in the English Lake District, \\"fell\\" being the local word for \\"hill\\". The name comes from Helvellyn, the highest summit of the group. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland.

The girl lived a few streets away from us, and one winter day---the day her elder sister was getting married---the toilet in their main upstairs bathroom broke and there was water everywhere. Her father, the lawyer called every plumber in the Yellow Page, but nobody would come and because we were having a major snowstorm. Her daughter told him that my father was a plumber, and he called, and my dad went right over---and took me with him.(Maybe he was hoping that the lawyer's daughter would be nicer to me.) My father fixed the toilet, help them clean up everything, and didn't take much time for his trouble.

Question: Which of the following is a flight muscle: the pectoralis, the skeleton, or the forelimb? Context: Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators.

We have the equation: -131675*b + 131412*b = 5260 To start, let's combine the terms with b in them.

The value of b is -20."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler faced further humiliation today after being referred to as ‘Rottweiler’ on a live news broadcast. The hugely embarrassing blunder took place during a flagship current affairs programme in Gabon, a former French colony on the west coast of Africa. A clip of the show is now spreading online in France, showing a female journalist announcing ‘more sad news’ towards the ends of a news show. Scroll down for video. In the doghouse: The female newsreader announced the 'sad news' that President Francois Hollande had broken up with 'the journalist Valerie Rottweiler' on Gabonese television. Un-muzzed: Valerie Trierweiler, pictured during her charity trip to India yesterday, earned the nickname 'Rottweiler' when she started dating Hollande. She then describes how President Francois Hollande has ended his ‘shared life’ with ‘the journalist Valerie Rottweiler’. Ms Trierweiler was first nicknamed ‘The Rottweiler’, after the potentially hugely aggressive dog, in April 2012. This was the month before Ms Trierweiler’s then boyfriend was elected, when she said: ‘I have character, they can’t muzzle me’. Ms Trierweiler has displayed her own fiery temper on numerous occasions, not least of all when she learned of Mr Hollande’s affair with the actress Julie Gayet almost three weeks ago. All over: President Hollande and Ms Trierweiler officially ended things over the weekend after his affair with a French actress. She is said to have gone on the rampage, smashing up antique furniture before checking herself into a hospital for eight days, suffering from stress. The relationship officially ended last Sunday, but Ms Trierweiler has been allowed to complete one last charity trip to India with presidential staff including a bodyguard. She is now expected to stay away from the Elysee Palace, and will be living alone in the flat she once shared with Mr Hollande in Paris’s 15th arrondissement. Gabon gained independence from France in 1960, but retains extremely close ties with its former coloniser.","completion":"1.

Answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… According to the above context, answer the following question. How did the casting director react to the actress who originated the role after the play opened? Options: [I] She recognized her but pretended she didn't. [II] She did not recognize her.

During the late Bronze Age the island experienced two waves of Greek settlement. The first wave consisted of Mycenaean Greek traders who started visiting Cyprus around 1400 BC. A major wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece from 1100 to 1050 BC, with the island's predominantly Greek character dating from this period. Cyprus occupies an important role in Greek mythology being the birthplace of Aphrodite and Adonis, and home to King Cinyras, Teucer and Pygmalion. Beginning in the 8th century BC Phoenician colonies were founded on the south coast of Cyprus, near present-day Larnaca and Salamis.

Let's break down the elements of the tweet to understand why: 1. \\"2605 Briana Shay is officially gone\\": This statement suggests that the address mentioned held some significance for the tweeter, and its mention creates a sense of nostalgia. Since this phrase marks the house as \\"officially gone,\\" it implies that it was recently sold or transferred to new owners. This could evoke feelings of sadness as it highlights that the tweeter no longer has ownership of the property. 2. \\"Our first house is sold\\": This statement conveys a sense of accomplishment, particularly in the context of buying and selling property, which is often considered a significant milestone in one's life. The fact that it is their \\"first house\\" adds to the value of this achievement, as first-time homeownership typically comes with a sense of pride. 3. The overall tone of the tweet: While it may be difficult to interpret emotions solely through text, the tweet seems to express a mix of feelings. There's a sense of success in selling the house, but there might also be some sadness in saying goodbye to their first home, which could have held many special memories. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet is a blend of nostalgia, accomplishment, and potentially a touch of sadness. The tweeter has successfully sold their first house, marking an important life achievement, but this milestone also comes with saying farewell to a place that held meaning and memories for them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – No amount of arrests will deter Marilyn Hartman from trying to sneak onto airplanes, apparently. The so-called \\"serial stowaway\\" was arrested twice more recently for loitering in terminal areas at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports, the AP reports. She was allegedly in a restricted area near a ticketing counter at O'Hare on April 24, and near a TSA checkpoint at Midway on Sunday. She was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing on state land both times, and was released the first time but is being held now. According to ABC 7 Chicago, the 63-year-old has been arrested 11 times since last year in airport incidents: In February of last year, she tried three times to stow away to Hawaii from San Francisco; she was released the first two times (even though, the very first time, she actually made it onboard a plane) but after the third incident, she spent eight days in jail. Then, in August, she actually did manage to fly from San Jose to Los Angeles sans ticket; she was arrested in LA. Just hours after the court ordered her to stay away from airports unless she had a boarding pass, though, she returned to LAX and was busted again. She ended up in jail. Just weeks later, after leaving jail for the last incident, she was busted while loitering in the Phoenix airport after allegedly trying to get through security; the airport had already booted her once before she was arrested. Then, in February, Hartman was arrested in Florida after allegedly flying there from Minnesota without a ticket. \\"What needs to happen is for someone—a doctor, probably—to sit down with her and find out what she needs that she’s not getting,\\" an advocate for homeless people who are mentally ill tells the San Francisco Chronicle. Article:","completion":"The Perseverance of a Serial Stowaway: Marilyn Hartman's Unrelenting Attempts to Sneak Onto Airplanes Despite numerous arrests and ongoing legal trouble, Marilyn Hartman, a 63-year-old woman infamously known as the \\"serial stowaway,\\" has exhibited an unwavering determination to sneak onto airplanes. Recently, she was arrested twice more for loitering in terminal areas at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports, where she was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing on state land. While her persistence may seem bewildering to some, her story raises important questions about the underlying factors that contribute to her compulsive behavior and her quest for a sense of belonging. Hartman's history of attempting to board planes without tickets dates back to February last year, when she made three separate attempts to stow away to Hawaii from San Francisco. Miraculously, she managed to board a plane on her first try, only to be caught and released two more times as she persisted in her endeavors. Despite spending eight days in jail for her third attempt, the time spent in custody wasn't enough to dissuade her from continuing her flight-crashing pursuits. In August, she scored a small victory by successfully flying from San Jose to Los Angeles without a ticket. However, she was promptly arrested upon arrival in LA and subsequently ordered by the court to stay away from airports unless she had a boarding pass. Unfazed, she returned to the Los Angeles International Airport just a few hours later, only to be arrested again and sent back to jail. Evidently, neither imprisonment nor court orders could hinder Hartman's ambition. After being released from jail, her wanderlust led her to Phoenix, where she was once again arrested for loitering in the airport. Then, in February, she allegedly flew from Minnesota to Florida without a ticket - an impressive yet unlawful feat that resulted in her arrest once more. Although Hartman's exploits may appear to be the work of a cunning and daring individual, those who have had the opportunity to engage with her closely suggest that there might be more at play beneath the surface. Advocates for homeless people who suffer from mental illness believe that her behavior could be indicative of an unmet mental health need. \\"What needs to happen is for someone—a doctor, probably—to sit down with her and find out what she needs that she's not getting,\\" one advocate told the San Francisco Chronicle. And considering her frequent encounters with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, it seems evident that a more comprehensive and compassionate approach might be necessary to better understand and address her relentless quest to fly. As of now, Hartman remains in custody following her latest struggle with Chicago airport security. While it is unclear how her story will unfold in the future, it is evident that her saga offers an invaluable insight into the importance of mental health awareness and the potential consequences of untreated mental illness. For now, one can only hope that Hartman finds the appropriate care and resources needed to navigate her life in a more constructive and legal manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Skin is cut or damaged - Bacteria enters through the wound - The bacteria reproduces and spreads - Causes symptoms - The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no immediate medical treatment happens, how will it affect more bacteria enters the wounds. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that if no immediate medical treatment is provided when the skin is cut or damaged, and bacteria enter the wound, it may lead to more bacteria entering the wound, potentially causing a worsened infection or disease. The lack of medical treatment could indeed have direct and indirect effects on the wound healing process. Direct effects: 1. Greater bacterial load: Without medical treatment, more bacteria can enter the wound, leading to an increased bacterial load. This may make it harder for the immune system to prevent the spread and reproduction of bacteria. 2. Delayed healing: Lack of treatment can result in a longer time for the wound to heal, providing an environment conducive to bacterial growth. 3. Increased risk of infection: As more bacteria enter and populate the wound, the likelihood of infection increases. Infections can range from mild to severe cases, such as cellulitis or sepsis. Indirect effects: 1. Weakened immune response: As the infection progresses, the immune system can become overwhelmed by the increased bacterial load, leading to a diminished capacity to fight off the infection. 2. Development of antibiotic resistance: A lack of immediate treatment may also increase the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. If antibiotics are eventually needed, these resistant strains may make treatment more challenging. 3. Systemic infection: In some cases, the bacteria may spread beyond the local wound area and enter the bloodstream, causing a systemic infection, which can lead to further complications and even organ failure. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that not providing immediate medical treatment for a damaged or cut skin, allowing bacteria to enter the wound, will further increase the number of bacteria and potentially worsen the infection. This lack of treatment can have both direct and indirect effects on the process and could ultimately lead to a more severe disease if not properly managed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I started by safely turning off the main power source to ensure my safety during the installation process. Next, using the various tools I had previously gathered, I diligently began to install the mounting bracket to the ceiling, ensuring it was secure enough to hold the weight of this multi-functional device. Then, with the assistance of a friend, I carefully lifted the fan's motor assembly onto the mounting bracket, connecting the appropriate wires as indicated in the manual. I made sure that the wire responsible for the light was correctly attached so that it could function properly once the installation was complete. Once the fan's motor assembly was successfully mounted and the wiring was taken care of, I proceeded with the affixation of the fan blades one by one, ensuring they were all tight and secure. I carefully attached the light fixture to the mounted fan, ensuring that it was fixed in the correct position and the appropriate wires from the light fixture were connected to the wires from the fan's motor assembly. With all components in their respective positions and all the wiring connected, I finally turned the power back on to test my newly installed fan with a light.

Article: Bones so frail it would be impossible to walk and room for only half a liver: Shocking research reveals what life would be like if a REAL woman had Barbie's body If Barbie was a real woman she'd be forced to walk on all fours and would be physically incapable of lifting her over-sized head - perhaps a far cry from what the designers of Mattel envisioned. A disturbing chart that converts the doll's body scale into a real-life human being's reveals the outrageous proportions that transforms her into something out of a Sci-Fi movie. Starting from the top down, Barbie's head would be two inches larger than the average American woman's while resting on a neck twice as long and six inches thinner. From these measurements she'd be entirely incapable of lifting her head. Mutant: The above picture shows how if Barbie's physical measurements were given to a real woman she'd only have room for half a liver and a few inches of intestine in her body, but room for a bigger brain Her 16-inch waist would also be four inches thinner than her head, leaving room for only half a liver and a few inches of intestine. Like her fragile 3.5 inch wrists, her 6-inch ankles would prevent her from heavy lifting. Then, as far as holding up her entire body - despite so much of it missing - it'd be an entirely impossible feat requiring her to walk on all fours. That method of mobility is further supported, strictly theoretically, by her children's size three feet. The graphs released by Rehabs.com , a site for locating mental health treatment centers in the U.S., aims to point out the outrageous physical characteristics of a doll seen for more than 50 years as a role model for girls. 'That would be one dope 21st birthday!' The Barbie collector demanded her 'own Barbie BUT with my actual body type' including cellulite since '95% of ALL women have it!' What are the odds? Among the above chart's findings, it tells how the odds of finding a single woman with the same tall and thin neck as Barbie is one out of 4.3 billion One of a kind: Mattel previously defended Barbie's slim figure because of the bulk her clothes' seams, snaps and zippers add In addition to comparing Barbie's body proportions to the average American woman's, it also compares them to the average anorexic woman. Further stressing Barbie's one-of-a-kind body, while considering the sizes of both average American women and anorexic women, Rehabs.com found the odds of finding a single woman with the same naturally tall and thin neck like Barbie is one out of 4.3 billion. Similarly finding a woman with Barbie's waist would be one out of every 2.4 billion. Men are not left out from their comparison though, with awareness paid to the physical proportions of Ken dolls, said to be generally closer to a reality than Barbie's. Barbie's size has long been controversial with Mattel previously defending her slim figure because of the bulk her clothes' seams, snaps and zippers added. In 1998 the dolls' waist was expanded and bust made smaller, said to reflect a more 'real' female body type. ||||| Since her inception 55 years ago, Barbie's gotten a lot of flack for how her freakish proportions negatively affect girls' body image and even lead to at least one tragic case of a woman literally trying to transform herself into the doll. Last month, Barbie's lead designer defended the doll’s proportions in an interview with Co.Design. But new research suggests it's not just body image that Barbie impacts negatively—it's a girl's career aspirations, too. A new study called \\"Boys Can Be Anything: Effect of Barbie Play on Girls' Career Cognitions\\" is, according to researchers Aurora Sherman of Oregon State University and Eileen Zurbriggen of the University of California, Santa Cruz, the first attempt to quantify how this freakishly proportioned doll influences girls’ ideas of their futures. Thirty-seven girls aged four through seven were assigned to play for five minutes with one of three toys: a Doctor Barbie, a Fashion Barbie, or a Mrs. Potato Head doll, who has all the sex appeal of a, uh, potato. After playtime, the girls were shown 10 photographs of various professions and asked how many they thought they could do in the future, and how many they thought boys could do. The girls who had played with homely Mrs. Potato Head reportedly believed they could go on to do just as many jobs as their male peers. But those who had played with Barbie, regardless of whether she was dressed as a doctor or a fashion model, saw themselves as having fewer career options than boys. \\"Perhaps Barbie can 'Be Anything' as the advertising for this doll suggests, but girls who play with her may not apply these possibilities to themselves,\\" Sherman says. \\"Something about the type of doll, not characteristics of the participants, causes the difference in career aspirations.\\" What about playing with Barbie makes girls doubt their future career possibilities? The researchers believe their study suggests that even young girls can recognize the sexualized nature of Barbie and her unrealistic body shape, and that these things can inform a girl's understanding of gender roles. But they admit they need to look more into why this occurs. The sample size in this study was small, the length of playtime short, and the researchers only optioned 10 careers. But if researchers could build on this initial study and solidly prove that Barbie’s influence is a negative one, maybe Mattel would at least consent to giving the poor doll enough room for a liver. ||||| Happy Birthday, Barbie! The world's most famous doll turns 55 today and she's looking fab, without even the tiniest hint of plastic surgery! (We couldn't help ourselves.) She's really come into her own now that she's well into her fifties and boy, is she aging gracefully or what? Wearing a slightly updated version of the swimsuit she first wore at her world debut in 1959's New York Toy Fair, Barbie is modeling alongside the likes of supermodels Lily Aldrin and Chrissy Teigen in Sports Illustrated's 50th Anniversary Swimsuit Issue. We wonder how she keeps her figure? Her appearance has caused a bit of a stir from bloggers and parents who are worried about the message Barbie sends to young girls about body image. Barbie herself had to put forth a statement about her daring decision to become a Sports Illustrated covergirl, with the hashtag, \\"#unapologetic.\\" Every year Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit drums up conversation and controversy...In 2014, does any women in the issue seriously need permission to appear there?...The word \\"model like the word \\"Barbie,\\" is often dismissed as a poseable plaything with nothing to say. And yet those featured are women who have broken barriers. established empires, built brands, branched out...Today, truly anything is possible for a girl...Pink isn't the problem. \\"Barbie\\" dolls aren't the problems. Models choosing to pose in a bikini aren't a problem. The assumption that women of any age should only be part of who they are in order to succeed is the problem. Whether you love her or hate her, the iconic doll has certainly earned her place in history. Here are some things that will probably surprise you about the 55-year-old and change the way you see her: 1) She's got something in common with Hillary Clinton. Drive. Check. Leadership. Check. Presidential dreams? Check. Barbie has run for president a total of six times! She first ran in the early 90s and hasn't given up since. Talk about persistence. 2) We're not really sure what her real hair color is, nowadays. The style chameleon has had at least 50 different hair colors in her lifetime, from her signature platinum blonde, to red, brown, to yes, it would appear, white. Silver power! 3) She's still got it. More than half a century after her creation, Barbie is still an incredibly popular toy across the globe. In 1959, 300,000 dolls were sold. Now in 2014, a Barbie doll is purchased every three seconds somewhere in the 150 countries where they are sold. 4) She likes younger men. Barbie was created March 9, 1959. Her beau, Ken, wasn't born for another two years and two days to be exact. We'd like to think she'd be a cougar. 5) Her real name is... In true 1950s style, Barbie's real name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. She was named after founder Ruth Handler's daughter. It was one of the most popular baby names of the 1950s. 6) She was made to promote girl power. \\"My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices,\\" creator Ruth Handler said. Today, Barbie continues to preach girl power, trying to show girls they can be whatever they dream of becoming. In just 55 years, she's managed to have a whopping 150 careers. \\"Isn't it time we teach girls to celebrate who they are? Isn't there room for capable and captivating? It's time to stop boxing in potential. Be free to launch a career in a swimsuit, lead a company while gorgeous, or wear pink to an interview at MIT. The reality of today is that girls can go anywhere and be anything,\\" Barbie said in a release. The reality of today is that girls can go anywhere and be anything. They should celebrate who they are and never have to apologize for it. — Barbie (@Barbie) February 22, 2014 She's tweeting up a storm and is also active on Facebook with the most followers of any doll. Ha. Take that American Girl! 8) She's the same age as... If Barbie were a real-life person, she'd be the same age as other celebs born in 1959, like Emma Thompson, Marie Osmond, and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Wow. 9) Like any baby boomer, she's witnessed plenty of historic moments and changes in the modern era. Barbie's life can only be described as colorful. She came into existence around the era of old-school glamour, became an astronaut during the space race, discoed her way through the 1970s, broke the \\"plastic ceiling\\" as a woman in business in the 1980s, entered politics in the 1990s, and even survived a high-profile breakup in 2004. She's gone from just a pretty face to becoming an athlete, teacher, vet, and even a Naval officer. She really has proven she won't be confined by a box. Happy Birthday, Barbie! |||||Summary:","completion":"This article discusses the unrealistic body proportions of the famous Barbie doll and the negative effects it may have on young girls' understanding of body image and career aspirations. Research reveals that if a real woman had the same body proportions as Barbie, she would have bones so frail it would be impossible to walk and would need to crawl on all fours. The doll has a 16-inch waist, which is 4 inches thinner than her head, leaving no room for a full liver, and only a few inches of intestine. In addition, her fragile wrists and ankles would prevent her from lifting heavy objects. Further research has shown that playing with a Barbie doll may negatively impact girls' career aspirations. In a study conducted on 37 girls aged four to seven, those who played with a Barbie doll, whether dressed as a doctor or a fashion model, saw themselves as having fewer career options than boys, whereas those who played with a Mrs. Potato Head doll believed they could have just as many jobs as their male peers. In response to controversy over Barbie's body image, Mattel has made some adjustments to the doll's proportions over the years, such as a smaller bust size and a wider waist. However, the unrealistic body proportions remain a concern among parents and researchers, who continue to question the impact of the doll on young girls' body image and self-esteem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even the fruits and vegetables you eat have different colors: blue blueberries, red strawberries, green broccoli, and orange carrots. Plant and animals often use color to attract attention. The substances responsible for these colors belong to a class of chemical called antioxidants . Plants make antioxidant to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet(UV) light. Ultraviolet light causes chemicals called free radicals to form within plant cells. They can destroy parts of plant. Free radicals also have damaging effects on human beings. Some of these effects like wrinkled skin can be seen. The damage is caused by the free radicals attacking cells in our bodies. Certain cancers and heart disease are linked to free radicals. Our bodies have natural defences for fighting off free radicals. While we are young, our defences are pretty strong. However, they get weaker as we get older. The body's built-in defences can only go so far without extra help. The key to fighting free radicals with fruits and vegetables is to mix and match colors. It's like sunscreen for the inside of your body. Go for a range of very bright colors. Colorful foods contain hundreds of healthy chemicals not found anywhere else. Research into how chemicals in blueberries affect the brain's function in rats suggests that these chemicals may help our own brains work more efficiently. Don't just blame the sun. Ultraviolet light isn't the only source of free radicals.

One player pitches both shoes in succession to one pit, followed by the other player. This is formally called an inning. Normally only one pitcher can score points per inning, however some leagues and tournaments play \`\`count all'', in which all points in each inning are counted. A live shoe that is not a ringer, but comes to rest six inches (6'') or closer to the stake, has a value of one (1) point (alternate scoring methods give 2 points if the horseshoe leans on the stake. Aka a \`\`leaner''). If both of one player's horseshoes are closer than the opponent's, two points are scored. A ringer scores three points. In the case of one ringer and a closer horseshoe, both horseshoes are scored for a total of four points. If a player throws two ringers, that player scores six points. If each player throws a ringer, the ringers cancel and no points are scored. If two ringers are thrown by one player and one ringer by the opponent, the player throwing two ringers scores three points. This is typically called \`\`two dead and three'' or \`\`three ringers three'' for score keeping purposes. Such occurrences are called \`\`dead ringers'' and are still used toward the pitcher/ringer average. Back-yard games can be played to any number of points that is agreed upon, but are usually to 21 points, win by 2. In most sanctioned tournaments the handicapped divisions pitch 50 shoe games, most points win. If there is a tie, the pitchers pitch an additional 2 innings (alternating pitch) until the tie is broken.

Answer:","completion":"Considering the context provided, it is likely that Carson would want to put the newly acquired knowledge and skills from Sydney into practice by attempting to bake a cake on their own. Carson's next steps may involve the following: 1. Gathering necessary ingredients: To bake a cake, Carson would need to gather the essential ingredients such as flour, sugar, baking powder, eggs, milk, butter, salt, and any desired flavorings (like vanilla or cocoa) or additives (like chocolate chips or nuts) to create the specific type of cake they want to make. 2. Procuring suitable equipment and tools: For baking a cake, Carson would require appropriate utensils, baking equipment, and tools such as mixing bowls, measuring cups and spoons, a whisk or electric mixer, a spatula, a sifter, parchment paper, a cake pan, and, of course, an oven. 3. Preheating the oven: Carson must preheat the oven to the required temperature, depending on the cake recipe they choose to follow. Most cakes are baked at a temperature between 325-375°F (165-190°C). 4. Preparing the cake batter: Carson would need to follow the instructions provided in the cake recipe or the steps taught by Sydney to create the cake batter. This process generally involves creaming together the butter and sugar, adding eggs one at a time, and gently incorporating the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) and the wet ingredients (milk and flavorings). 5. Pouring the batter into the cake pan: Once the cake batter is smooth and well-mixed, Carson should pour it into a greased and/or parchment-lined cake pan to ensure easy removal after baking. 6. Baking the cake: Carson should place the cake pan in the preheated oven and bake the cake for the suggested time mentioned in the recipe, usually anywhere between 20-45 minutes, depending on the type and size of the cake. They must also ensure not to open the oven door until the cake is close to being done, as this could cause the cake to deflate. 7. Checking for doneness: Carson can determine whether their cake is fully baked by inserting a toothpick or a knife into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs, the cake is ready. If it comes out wet or with uncooked batter, Carson should bake the cake for an additional few minutes and check again. 8. Cooling the cake: Once the cake is baked, Carson should remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes in the pan before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. This step is essential to avoid the cake from falling apart when slicing or decorating. 9. Decorating the cake: If Carson wants to, they can now decorate the cake with frosting, icing, or any other toppings. They could explore various decorating techniques and creative ideas to make their cake visually appealing. In summary, Carson would most likely want to apply their newfound knowledge of baking a cake by gathering suitable ingredients and equipment, following a recipe, preparing, and baking the cake, and possibly even decorating it as desired. This endeavor would allow Carson to test their skills, gain more experience, and enjoy the satisfaction of creating a delicious homemade cake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. Which company's potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant, PepsiCo or Kettle Foods? Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that PepsiCo's potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant compared to Kettle Foods' potatoes. This is because PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers, while Kettle Foods has been supplying non-GMO potato seeds. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are developed through genetic engineering techniques that allow scientists to modify their genetic material. One of the primary goals of creating GMO crops is to increase their resilience against various environmental factors, including resistance to pests, diseases, and tolerance to herbicides. In the case of herbicide-tolerant crops, a specific gene is implanted into their genome, enabling the plants to withstand exposure to herbicides without being adversely affected. Consequently, farmers can use herbicides to control weeds without causing harm to the herbicide-resistant crop. Since PepsiCo supplies GMO potato seeds, it is likely that their potatoes are engineered to be herbicide-tolerant, allowing farmers to effectively manage weeds without damaging the crop. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplies non-GMO potato seeds, which means that their potatoes have not been genetically engineered to have increased herbicide tolerance. While it is possible that Kettle Foods' potatoes may still possess some level of natural herbicide tolerance, it is unlikely to be as high as that of the genetically engineered potatoes supplied by PepsiCo. As a result, PepsiCo's potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant compared to Kettle Foods' potatoes. However, it is essential to recognize that there may be concerns associated with the widespread use of herbicide-tolerant crops, such as the emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds or potential nutritional concerns related to increased glyphosate usage. As with any agricultural practice, understanding the costs and benefits of both GMO and non-GMO crops is crucial for making informed decisions about their use and management."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Make sure the chair is not wobbly, and doesn’t rotate or have wheels (e.g. an office chair) If you are at the gym, you can sit on a weightlifting bench. The exercise band should be placed behind your knees, on top of your clothing. The band should be tight enough so that it is challenging to pull your knees apart, but not so hard that you cannot perform the exercise. Alternatively, you can also create resistance using your hands. Simply make a fist with both hands and place each hand on the outside of each knee. For example, your left hand will be on the outside of your left knee, and the right hand will be on the outside of your right knee. Use the strength of your arms as resistance. Take a breath in, and as you exhale, begin the exercise. try to push your knees apart, against the resistance bands for four seconds. Then, exhale as you release. Keep the muscles in your abdomen contracted while you do this exercise to keep your spine protected. Don’t hold your breath as you perform the exercise, as this may make you dizzy. You should try to press against the band so that you feel the outer muscles of your thigh contracting. It is not necessary to spread your legs as wide as they will go. If it is possible for you to do this, you might need to try a tighter resistance band. You should try to do three sets of 15 repetitions. This means that you will repeat the exercise 15 times, take a short break of a minute or so, and then repeat for two more sets of 15. You should aim to do this exercise three to five times per week.

Solve this math problem Solve 1851*l = -7844 - 2819 - 24506 for l.","completion":"Sure, I can solve this for you. Here's how you can think of it: First, let's add up all the numbers on the right side of the equals sign. That's -7844 - 2819 - 24506. When you subtract or \\"take away\\" all these numbers from zero, you get -35569. It's like starting from zero, going 7844 steps to the left, then 2819 more steps to the left, then finally 24506 more steps to the left, ending up at -35569. Now, we have to find the value of \\"l\\" and we know that 1851 times l equals -35569. This means, if you have 1851 of some thing, and you've multiplied it by a certain number (our 'l'), you would have -35569 of that thing. To find out what that 'l' is, we just divide -35569 by 1851. And when you do that, you get about -19.23. So \\"l\\" is about -19.23. This means if you had 1851 apples, and each time you took a step you lost about 19.23 apples (which is a lot!), by the time you've taken all your steps, you would have lost 35569 apples."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise suggests that one must travel south from Chios Town to reach the mastic groves. This indicates that the mastic groves are located in the southern direction from Chios Town. Thus, it is not accurate to claim that the mastic groves are found north of Chios Town according to the provided information. The island of Chios is a Greek island situated in the Aegean Sea, off the coast of Turkey. Chios Town, also known as Chora, lies on the eastern coast of the island and serves as both the capital and main port of Chios. Mastic, a natural resin obtained from mastic trees (Pistacia lentiscus var. chia) that grow in southern Chios, is one of the island's most valuable products. The mastic groves, where these trees grow and the mastic resin is collected, are primarily concentrated in the southern region, known as the Mastic Villages or Mastichochoria. Therefore, to reach the mastic groves from Chios Town, one needs to travel southward. Once they arrive in this region, they can visit some of the well-known Mastic Villages like Pyrgi and Mesta, which are famous for their unique architecture, history, and the cultivation of mastic trees and production of mastic products. These villages are renowned for the well-preserved medieval castles and the distinct geometric patterns that decorate the exteriors of the houses, known as \\"xysta.\\" In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The mastic groves are found north of Chios Town\\" is not accurate. Based on the premise given, the mastic groves are located in the southern direction from Chios Town. The Mastic Villages in southern Chios not only offer an insight into the island's mastic production but also reflect the rich history and cultural heritage of the region."},{"prompt":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What album title was taken from a passage in a Stephen King novel?, using the article: Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987.

Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates. and a hint : Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year. Please answer this question : Which student knew more about tectonic plate pull?

During the 1960 Summer Olympics, Wilma Rudolph became a world renowned star along with which former National Basketball Association player who played for the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks? Answer:","completion":"During the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome, Italy, Wilma Rudolph became a world-renowned star not only for her incredible performance but also due to her inspiring personal story. She overcame childhood illnesses such as polio and ultimately became an outstanding athlete, winning three gold medals in track and field events at these Olympics. She was nicknamed \\"The Tornado\\" or \\"La Gazzella\\" because of her sheer speed and grace on the track. Her achievements in Rome made her the first American woman to win three gold medals in a single Olympiad. As for the former National Basketball Association (NBA) player who shared the world stage alongside Wilma Rudolph during the 1960 Summer Olympics and later played for the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks, his name is Oscar Robertson, also known as \\"The Big O.\\" A legendary professional basketball player, Robertson is considered one of the all-time greatest players in the history of the sport. In the 1960 Olympic Games, he was a member of the United States men's basketball team, which won the gold medal, defeating the Brazilian team in the final match. Oscar Robertson was a versatile player who excelled at scoring, rebounding, and playmaking. Born in 1938 in Charlotte, Tennessee, he had an exceptional career in high school and college basketball before joining the NBA. While playing college basketball at the University of Cincinnati, he led his team to two Final Four appearances and became a three-time First Team All-American. Later, he was selected as a territorial pick in the 1960 NBA Draft by the Cincinnati Royals and played for them from 1960 to 1970. During his decade-long tenure with the Cincinnati Royals, Robertson made a lasting impact, earning an All-Star selection in each season and obtaining the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in 1964. Known for his exceptional all-around skills, he became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double across an entire season, doing so during the 1961-1962 season. His final years in the NBA were spent with the Milwaukee Bucks from 1970 to 1974, where he played alongside another NBA legend, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Together, they helped lead the Bucks to their first and only NBA championship in 1971. After retiring from basketball, Oscar Robertson became an influential advocate for NBA players, serving as the president of the NBA Players Association. He acted as a key figure in a lawsuit against the league that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the \\"reserve clause,\\" allowing for increased player mobility and the establishment of free agency in the NBA. In recognition of his numerous accomplishments and contributions to the game, Robertson was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1980, solidifying his status as one of the sport's greatest legends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 20:57 EST, 9 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 12:17 EST, 10 December 2012. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was willing to travel to Portugal to see first hand how the 'depenalisation' of drugs has worked in practice. Ministers are to examine Portugese laws to ‘depenalise’ drugs after a damning report said the government’s current strategy is not working. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was ready to visit Portugal to see first hand how the removal of criminal penalties for people caught with small amounts of drugs could help tackle the problem in the UK. He insisted the government was ‘open to new ways of thinking’ after the Commons home affairs select committee asked for a royal commission to examine. whether possession of drugs – even heroin and crack – should cease to be. a criminal offence. The committee said it was 'impressed' by the Portugese system and 'alternative strategies should now be considered'. Mr Browne said today: 'There are interesting new ideas. The report says we should look more carefully at the model that’s happened in Portugal. 'I’m certainly happy to go to Portugal as the report recommends and see what they’re doing there. So we should be open to new ideas and fresh thinking but we should also acknowledge that we’ve made a lot of progress in the last five or ten years.' Mental health campaigners warned the link between cannabis and mental health should not be ignored. But the committee said was clear from other countries that the British approach was not working, and alternative strategies - such as those developed in Portugal - should now be considered. 'We were impressed by what we saw of the Portuguese depenalised system. It had clearly reduced public concern about drug use in that country, and was supported by all political parties and the police,' it said. 'Although it is not certain that the Portuguese experience could be replicated in the UK, given societal differences, we believe this is a model that merits significantly closer consideration.' Ministers should, it said, open discussions with the United Nations Commission on Drugs on new ways tackle what it called the 'global drugs dilemma' - including 'the possibility of legalisation and regulation'. Legalise it: Some say a legalisation of drugs would prevent a black market and benefit Britain whilst anti-drugs charities say it will flood the country with drugs. However Mr Browne said so-called legal highs now posed a 'mutating threat' after an 'explosion' in their use in recent years. 'We have a growing problem with the. drugs that are legal, so called legal highs and we have a diminishing. problem with drugs that are illegal like heroin and crack cocaine. So I. don’t think that it automatically follows that making drugs legal. reduces harm.' Mr Browne was forced to repeatedly deny the report would be shelved, as a senior Tory appeared to back a major. shift in drugs law by suggesting legal bans should be. replaced by education for users. On Twitter, Michael Fabricant, who is a Tory party vice-chairman, wrote: ‘Have often said: Prohibition in US didn’t work. Created crime & black market. Home Affairs Committee is right to ask if drug prohibition works. ‘If we spent the money on educating people that drugs are dangerous instead of attempting & failing to ban them, I suspect more effective.’ The committee’s conclusions were undermined however by detailed minutes of its meetings that showed three of its five Tory members voted against the recommendation to call for a royal commission. Drug support: Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant, pictured at a 2008 protest, said money is better spent on education about the dangers of drugs than enforcing bans. The panel also split evenly on whether cannabis should be given a lower classification. That recommendation was included on the casting vote of the chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz. The report sparked fury among drugs campaigners – and ministers immediately ruled out major changes to the law. Mary Brett, of the charity Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘A royal commission would cost the earth, and we do not need it to tell us what we already know: legalisation would open the floodgates and drug use would increase. It will also do nothing to help Colombia.’ Marjorie Wallace, of Sane, a mental health charity, said: ‘If the report is to be responsible, it must take account of the specific damage that cannabis can do to the developing brain. ‘Not only because recent studies have shown it inducing irreversible cognitive deterioration but in around 10 per cent of cases triggering severe psychotic illness.’ The MPs took evidence from comedian and former heroin addict Russell Brand, who said drug bans didn’t work, and Sir Richard Branson who said the sale of drugs should be permitted and taxed. They visited Colombia to see the effects of the drugs trade, and met the country’s president. The report said the MPs ‘recognise and sympathise with the immense suffering and slaying of innocent people which tragically has taken place over the years in Colombia and other Latin American countries, as a result of the murderous rivalry between drug gangs.’ The MPs called for cannabis to be reclassified as a Class C drug from Class B. The report also claims the lack of a ban on cigarettes and alcohol can send a ‘confusing message’ to drug users. A Government spokesman said: ‘We have no intention of downgrading or declassifying cannabis. A royal commission on drugs is simply not necessary.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Choose from: (i) Randy was captivated.. (ii) Neil was captivated..","completion":"Neil was captivated by the entire process, as Randy meticulously explained each step, emphasizing the importance of the materials, the finesse of assembly, and the final touches that made the homemade whiteboard truly unique. As they embarked on this crafty project together, Neil found himself thoroughly engrossed in learning, asking questions, and even offering creative suggestions at various stages of the process. Randy kicked off the demonstration by outlining the list of materials they would need. This included a white, non-porous surface such as a smooth piece of melamine board or a white Plexiglas sheet, simple wood or aluminum trim to create a frame, strong adhesive, mounting hardware, a measuring tape, a hand saw, and sandpaper. Neil could hardly contain his curiosity, making mental notes of the most vital items he'd require to recreate the project on his own. As they began the groundwork, Randy elaborately demonstrated how to cut the white surface precisely to the desired dimensions, ensuring that the lines were straight and clean. He also discussed the crucial role of sandpaper to smooth out any imperfections in the cut, and he even shared tricks to avoid splinters when using wooden surfaces. Neil, captivated by the expert knowledge Randy possessed, committed everything to memory in a bid to perfect his own future homemade whiteboards. Randy continued the lesson by presenting a variety of framing options, showcasing the pros and cons of wooden, aluminum, or even plastic frames. They eventually settled on a gorgeous, minimalistic wooden frame that complemented their choice of the whiteboard surface. Together, they carefully cut and sanded the frame pieces, measuring and attaching them to the whiteboard using a strong adhesive. Neil closely observed Randy's precision, admiring the craftsmanship that went into constructing such a polished product. They let the adhesive dry, and then Randy showed Neil how to securely mount the whiteboard on the wall using sturdy brackets and anchors, ensuring that it stayed in place without causing any damage. Randy further demonstrated how to conceal the hardware beneath the frame for a sleek appearance, impressing Neil with the aural and visual fixation of the DIY project. The glorious final touch was adding a compact tray beneath the whiteboard to store markers and an eraser. Randy explained the importance of selecting the right material for easy cleaning, as well as the best placement to ensure both accessibility and aesthetics. By this point, Neil had all the knowledge and inspiration he needed to create his very own masterpiece of a whiteboard, and he couldn't wait to embark on this journey. Throughout the entire process, Neil was captivated by Randy's guidance and expertise. What began as a casual craft project had transformed into an educational and fulfilling undertaking—a tangible symbol of creativity and personal accomplishment. Now equipped with the wisdom and the practical abilities to construct his own whiteboard, Neil could finally bring his vision to life. He was exceptionally grateful for the time and effort Randy had put into their demonstration, setting the stage for countless productive future endeavors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Katie Nicholl, Mail On Sunday Royal Correspondent. She's done a remarkable job of overseeing her family’s rise up the social ladder – but these pictures might give Carole Middleton something to be a little anxious about. For they show that her son James, the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger brother, is still in a relationship with TV presenter Donna Air – ‘a single mother from Newcastle’, as some commentators snobbishly sniped. The pair were inseparable for much of last year, but when they spent Christmas apart it triggered reports that their relationship had hit the rocks. However, Donna and James – who are just coming up to their first anniversary – have laughed off rumours of a split. Still together? James Middleton (left) and Donna Air (right) enjoyed a relaxed rendezvous at his west London office on Friday before leaving separately, pictured - including with Ella, the sister of Kate's cocker spaniel. They enjoyed a relaxed rendezvous on Friday at James’s West London office – and these exclusive photographs show them venturing out separately to take James’s dog Ella – the sister of Kate’s cocker spaniel Lupo – for a walk. They slipped out of the base of James’s baking company Nice Cakes, which is above a sushi restaurant in South Kensington, moments apart, before joining up for their first public outing together since early November. They met at a dinner party in February last year and became a fixture at showbiz bashes, but at the tail end of last year, Donna, 34, attended several without her 26-year-old toyboy, first prompting reports of a split. The couple also spent the festive period apart. James decamped to the £4.5 million family manor house in Bucklebury, Berkshire, for Christmas with mum Carole, a former air hostess, dad Michael and sister Pippa and – later – Kate, William and six-month-old Prince George. Meanwhile Donna returned to Newcastle to spend Christmas with her family before heading to Goa and Kerala in India for some New Year sunshine with Freya, her ten-year-old daughter with her ex-partner – the 53-year-old casino-owning multi-millionaire environmentalist Damian Aspinall. A source close to James told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘People were saying they’ve split because they haven’t been photographed for a while but they are still together and everything’s good.’ And a friend of Donna’s – who is soon to launch her own jewellery range – added, ‘They will have been together for a year soon. They are as happy as ever and have laughed at reports their relationship is over.’ As well at being regulars at various London members’ clubs last year, the pair were also spotted out clubbing with James’ sister Pippa and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Last September, Donna told The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine: ‘James is wonderful . . . And yes, there is also the bonus that he brings something I have always searched for and will always need in my life... cake.’ Meanwhile, another picture of James has just been made public – as a photograph of him as a teenage at Marlborough College has been posted on Facebook by his old school pal James Simison.

The Buccaneers stayed home this week for a rematch against their division rivals the Atlanta Falcons. With the convincing victory, Tampa Bay clinched the NFC South division title, maintained a perfect 5-0 division record, and scored their first kickoff return touchdown in franchise history. Tampa Bay's defense recorded the first points of the game, as Ronde Barber intercepted Chris Redman's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown. Atlanta got on the board next with kicker Morten Andersen making a 33-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Micheal Spurlock made team history by becoming the first Buccaneer player to return a kickoff for a touchdown. It was the first kickoff return touchdown for Tampa Bay in 32 seasons, 498 games, and 1,865 attempts. After the Buccaneer defense forced a Falcons punt, Jeff Garcia commandeered a long, clock-eating 10-minute drive ending in a 33-yard field goal by Matt Bryant to make the score 17-3.

With a 24-3 lead, Tampa Bay performed a pooch kickoff, and Atlanta muffed the return, while Kalvin Pearson recovered. Tampa Bay drove to the 24-yard line, but DeAngelo Hall intercepted a pass intended for Joey Galloway at the Atlanta 11-yard line. The Buccaneers would immediately regain possession as Greg White forced and recovered a fumble on the next play. Matt Bryant then easily converted a 28-yard field goal to take a 27-3 lead into halftime. Tampa Bay would receive the second half's opening kickoff, but was forced to punt after a 7-minute drive. On Atlanta's third play, Jermaine Phillips intercepted a pass intended for Jerious Norwood which set Tampa Bay up at the Atlanta 23-yard line. Matt Bryant then scored the half's first points with a 34-yard field goal to make the score 30-3. In the fourth quarter, punter Josh Bidwell successfully pinned Atlanta at their own 6-yard line. The resulting poor field position eventually led to Tampa Bay taking over near midfieldied Michael Bennett carried six times all the way to the Atlanta 1-yard line, from which Anthony Becht scored the game's final points off a 1-yard TD catch. Statistically, Tampa Bay's defense dominated Atlanta. The Falcons managed only 133 yards of total offense, committed five turnovers, and were 0-for-9 on third down conversions. The Falcons crossed midfield only once, and Tampa Bay's time of possession was 43 minutes.

We want to find the value of \\"g\\" that makes our equation equal to 0. Our equation is: 0 = -40*g - 6*g - 460 Now, let's combine the \\"g\\" parts. Since we have -40 times \\"g\\" and -6 times \\"g\\", we can add those together. -40 plus -6 is -46. So it looks like this now: 0 = -46*g - 460 Next, we want to get \\"g\\" by itself.

Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet (; 2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory. In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Ice breaks away from a frozen coastline near the Norwegian Arctic town of Longyearbyen April 23, 2007. 500 MILES FROM THE NORTH POLE The minimum summertime volume of Arctic sea ice fell to a record low last year, researchers said in a study to be published shortly, suggesting that thinning of the ice had outweighed a recovery in area. The study estimated that last year broke the previous, 2007 record for the minimum volume of ice, which is calculated from a combination of sea ice area and thickness. The research adds to a picture of rapid climate change at the top of the world that could see the Arctic Ocean ice-free within decades, spurring new oil exploration opportunities but possibly also disrupted weather patterns far afield and a faster rise in sea levels. The authors developed a model predicting thickness across the Arctic Ocean based on actual observations of winds, air and ocean temperatures. \\"The real worrisome fact is downward trend over the last 32 years,\\" said Axel Schweiger, lead author of the paper, referring to a satellite record of changes in the Arctic. He was emailing Reuters at the Greenpeace icebreaker Arctic Sunrise, in the Arctic Ocean between the Norwegian island of Svalbard and the North Pole. \\"(It fell) by a large enough margin to establish a statistically significant new record,\\" said the authors in their paper titled \\"Uncertainty in modeled Arctic sea ice volume.\\" The researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle checked the model results against real readings of ice thickness using limited submarine and satellite data. The approach has some detractors because it is focused is on modeling rather than direct observations of thickness, and therefore contains some uncertainty. Sea ice area is easier to measure by satellite than ice thickness, and so has not needed a modeling approach. Ice thickness is just as important or more so in helping understand what is happening in the far north. Some experts argue that part of the reason the ice area has dramatically fallen in recent years is because it has been thinning for decades. The authors said their Pan-arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) in general agreed well with actual observations, although \\"modeling error\\" was possible. The Arctic sea ice area fell below 4.6 million sq km last week with two weeks of the melt season still to go, compared with the record low of 4.13 million sq km in 2007. By comparison, the minimum ice extent in the early 1970s was about 7 million square km. Ice melts every year during the summer and reaches a minimum extent in mid-September. Most experts now agree that the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free in late summer at some point this century but disagree about exactly when. While sea ice itself does not raise sea levels when it melts, a warmer Arctic could speed up melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which is freshwater ice trapped over land and contains enough water to raise world sea levels by 7 meters. ||||| Some researchers believe that the actual volume of sea ice in the Arctic has already fallen to a record minimum this summer. The extent of the Arctic covered by sea ice this summer has also continued to decline – a trend seen since 1979 when the first satellite measurements were collected. Although satellites are good at measuring the surface area of ocean that is covered by the floating sea ice, it is not so easy to assess ice volume, which requires accurate measurements of ice thickness over wide regions. Satellites have produced clear evidence that the sea-ice extent – the area covered by at least 15 per cent of ice – has fallen consistently and significantly each summer over the past 30 years. Since 1979, sea ice extent in summer has fallen by around 30 per cent, according to satellite data. Walt Meier, of the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado, said that at the moment the Arctic sea ice is on track to be second or third lowest in terms of sea-ice extent, although there is still about another week or so until the summer melt period finally comes to an end. \\"A lot still depends on the weather. If a warm front comes through, there could still be some rapid melting. But at present we think it could be close to or as low as the 2007 record minimum,\\" Dr Meier said. The sea ice in the Arctic goes through annual cycles of melting in summer and reforming each winter. However, as average temperatures in the the Arctic region have increased in recent decades – faster than in most other regions of the world – summer sea ice has disappeared faster than predicted, and winter ice has not reformed as readily as it once did. In 2007, there was a \\"perfect storm\\" of driving winds that piled the sea ice up against the Greenland coastline and high pressure that removed cloud cover at the height of summer season to create idea conditions for the melting of the sea ice. This year the sea ice is more dispersed, but in terms of total surface area covered by ice, it probably ranks close or equal to 2007, Dr Meier said. The last four summers have experienced the four lowest minima since satellite readings were first gathered and eight of the ten lowest summers have occurred in the past decade, he said. At the same time, there has been a marked decrease in thick \\"multi-year\\" sea ice that is older than five years, and an increase in the proportion of thinner, younger ice which is more likely to melt away completely in summer. Scientists at the University of Washington in Seattle estimated that the actual volume of sea in the Arctic is already at an all-time low, lower even than in 2007 because then the ice that was left was older, multi-year ice several metres thick. However, estimating ice volume is notoriously difficult. ||||| The total volume of Arctic sea ice shrank last fall to the smallest amount ever observed during the age of satellites, according to a new study that used a ultra-sophisticated computer modeling program that incorporates ocean observations, submarine data, and space-age monitoring. But that 2010 record -- discussed in a research paper still in press and reported around the world by a Reuter’s dispatch from a Greenpeace icebreaker -- may be already threatened by this year's polar meltdown. New estimates by the same team of scientists at the Polar Science Center of the University of Washington appear to show ice volume is now plunging faster than it did at the same time last year when the record was set. As of July 31, the last time numbers were crunched and posted online, the volume of sea ice appeared to be about 2,135 cubic miles -- more than 50 percent lower than the average volume and 62 percent lower than the maximum volume of ice that covered the Arctic back in 1979, the scientists said here. “Sea ice volume is an important climate indicator,” the group explains here. “It depends on both ice thickness and extent and therefore more directly tied to climate forcing than extent alone. However, Arctic sea ice volume cannot currently be observed continuously. Observations from satellites, Navy submarines, moorings, and field measurements are all limited in space and time.” The melt season for Arctic sea ice climaxes each September or October, and many people closely track the satellite generated reports and analysis of sea ice extent by the National Snow and Ice Data Center. But another way of gauging the health of sea ice focuses on trying to estimate the actual amount of ice out there -- both the footprint of the floes on the surface, plus the fabled seventh-eighths hidden underneath in the sea. It’s an exceedingly difficult task. To be published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, “Uncertainty in Modeled Arctic Sea Ice Volume” is a highly technical discussion of how the scientists at the Polar Science Center calculate, monitor and reality check the ongoing volume of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean using their Pan-arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System. The system uses complicated climate models for ice, ocean and air along with observations to conjure an estimate of what’s really happening on and below the surface to the Arctic floes in real time. The trend lines of these “anomalies” in volume seem to be literally dropping off their scales for this time of year in both 2010 and 2011, according to the most current chart. This year has dropped further. “Given all the uncertainties and margins for error, it’s tough to declare a single year a “record,” said lead author Axel Schweiger and four co-authors in their paper. “However, the 2010 September ice volume anomaly did in fact exceed the previous 2007 minimum by a large enough margin to declare it a new record.” With a cinematic dateline of “500 MILES FROM THE NORTH POLE,” news of their conclusion was posted around the world this week after a Reuters reporter filed a story from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise as it steamed through Far North waters. (Check out the Arctic Sunrise webcam.) “The research adds to a picture of rapid climate change at the top of the world that could see the Arctic Ocean ice-free within decades, spurring new oil exploration opportunities but possibly also disrupted weather patterns far afield and a faster rise in sea levels,” wrote reporter Gerard Wynn. \\"The real worrisome fact is downward trend over the last 32 years,\\" Schweiger told Wynn in an email. In a story filed last week (dateline: OFF SVALBARD), Wynn interviewed NSIDC director Mark Serreze and reported that the extent of Arctic Sea ice had already reached the third lowest level in the satellite record with several weeks left before the annual slush cup ends. \\"We just dropped below 4.6 million square kilometres and that's what we had in 2010 (at the minimum),” Serreze told Wynn in this story. “We're continuing the overall pattern of loss, and there's still a couple of weeks to go in the melt season. “Will we break the record in 2007? I don't think so but we're going to be close.\\" Contact Doug O'Harra at doug(at)alaskadispatch.com. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Okay little buddy, I'll try to make it as simple as I can for you!

Answer this question: what is the fluid-filled space behind the oval window??","completion":"The fluid-filled space behind the oval window is called the scala vestibuli, which is a part of the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea is a snail-shaped, bony structure and consists of three key parts: the scala vestibuli, scala media, and scala tympani. These three chambers run the entire length of the cochlea and are filled with different fluids that play a crucial role in the hearing process. The scala vestibuli is the upper chamber, and it is filled with a fluid called perilymph. The oval window, also called the fenestra ovalis, is a membrane-covered opening separating the middle ear from the scala vestibuli. When sound waves vibrate the eardrum, the ossicles (the malleus, incus, and stapes) of the middle ear amplify the vibrations and transfer them to the oval window. The stapes bone interacts directly with the oval window, leading to the vibration of the membrane. Perilymph fluid in the scala vestibuli conducts these vibrations and facilitates the movement of the fluid contained in the middle chamber, the scala media. The scala media is filled with a different fluid called endolymph and houses the spiral organ of Corti. The organ of Corti consists of specialized hair cells that move corresponding to the vibrations and generate electrical signals that are then transmitted to the cochlear nerve. The third chamber, the scala tympani, is also filled with perilymph. It is located below the scala media, and the fluid vibrations eventually pass to this chamber before dissipating as they reach the round window – another membrane-covered opening in the cochlear partition that separates the scala tympani from the middle ear cavity. In summary, the fluid-filled space behind the oval window is the scala vestibuli, which plays a pivotal role in transferring sound vibrations from the oval window to other cochlear chambers, ultimately leading to the transformation of these mechanical vibrations into electrical signals that are sent to the brain and interpreted as sound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Years have passed since Crystal Lake had been renamed to Forest Green, but Tommy Jarvis is still suffering from hallucinations ever since his past encounter with Jason Voorhees. Tommy returns with his friend Allen Hawes, hoping to cremate Jason's body and stop his hallucinations. At the cemetery, they dig up Jason's corpse, but seeing it causes Tommy to snap, and he stabs Jason's body with a metal fence post. As he turns his back on Jason, two lightning bolts strike the post and revive the now-undead killer. Tommy tries to light the gasoline in which he has soaked Jason, but a sudden downpour prevents it. When Hawes tries to attack Jason with a shovel, the shovel breaks on impact and his heart is punched out. Tommy makes his way to the sheriff's office, when he panics and attempts to grab weapons, it gets him put into a jail cell. His warning that Jason has returned goes unheeded by Sheriff Garris, who is aware of Tommy's mental problems and thinks he is imagining Jason. On the road, camp counselors Darren and Lizbeth get lost looking for the camp and run into Jason. After they fail trying to frighten Jason off the road, he impales them both with the metal rod that resurrected him. The next morning, Garris' daughter Megan and her friends Sissy, Cort and Lizbeth's sister Paula ask him to search for Darren and Lizbeth. Tommy warns them about Jason, but as he is now considered an urban legend they ignore the warnings, though Megan finds herself attracted to him. In the woods, Jason happens upon a corporate paintball game. He kills four of the players for their equipment and chases the fifth off into the woods. At Camp Forest Green, the kids arrive, and the teens do their best to run the camp without Darren and Lizbeth. Meanwhile, Garris decides to escort Tommy out of his jurisdiction due to his influence on his daughter. Tommy tries to make a run for Jason's grave, but finds that the caretaker had covered it up to deny responsibility for it being dug up, and Hawes' body is buried in its place. Tommy is then...

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of decreasing wave sizes would have a direct impact on the erosion process by the ocean. When wave sizes decrease, the energy contained in the waves is reduced. This will affect multiple steps of the erosion process, as follows: 1. With smaller waves, there would be less force to wash onto beaches. This would directly impact the first step, \\"Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves,\\" by decreasing the amount of water and sediment brought to the shore. 2. Due to less forceful waves, the amount of sediment carried from the ocean would also decrease. This directly affects the second step, \\"The waves contain sediment from the ocean,\\" as the sediment concentration in the waves would be reduced. 3. Smaller waves would have a weaker impact on the rocks and sand on the beach. This directly impacts the third step, \\"The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach,\\" reducing the wear on the rocks and decreasing the amount of material loosened and added to the coastal sediment. 4. Another step directly impacted would be the fifth, \\"Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks,\\" where smaller waves would be less effective in dislodging rock fragments. 5. The sixth step, \\"The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach,\\" would also be directly impacted, as smaller waves would have reduced capacity to transport loose material back into the ocean. Overall, the perturbation of smaller wave sizes would directly impact multiple steps of the erosion process, resulting in less erosion by the ocean. The lesser energy contained in the smaller waves would reduce the efficiency of sediment transportation and the wear on rocks and sand on the beach. Consequently, the rocks and beach would experience slower rates of change and erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera. I didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off. Question: Why did the narrator try to flip off the camera? Answer: A:","completion":"The narrator tried to flip off the camera because they were frustrated and angry at being denied entry to the event despite having an invitation. They initially wondered if the doorman knew who they were and had a reason to keep them out, but then they noticed the doorman's earpiece and the surveillance camera perched above. They suspected that someone behind the camera, possibly involved in the event's organization, was instructing the doorman to specifically keep them out. The act of flipping off the camera was the narrator's way of expressing their resentment and defiance towards the person making that decision, as well as possibly drawing attention to the fact that they knew they were being monitored. They later learned that Dylan Maxwell, an individual who was monitoring the cameras, was indeed responsible for their exclusion and was laughing at their predicament. This situation indicates that the narrator might have had a history or conflict with Dylan Maxwell, leading to their denial of entry into the event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Addison brought their stuff back home. Given the question \\"How would Addison feel after?\\", is \\"like a lonely person\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"Yes, \\"like a lonely person\\" could be a valid answer to the question \\"How would Addison feel after?\\", especially when we consider the various situations that could pertain to Addison's feelings after finishing their freshman year of college and returning home. However, it's crucial to remember that everyone's experience and emotional processing differs significantly from one another. Therefore, this answer is situational and largely dependent on Addison's subjective experiences and emotional responses. Let's examine the potential circumstances that might result in Addison feeling \\"like a lonely person.\\" 1. Transitioning between Different Environments: After experiencing a year of university life, which is usually filled with social interactions, diverse experiences, and the development of a newfound independence, returning home might be a stark contrast, and Addison could possibly feel isolated or lonely. 2. Missing the Campus Life: If they thoroughly appreciated the social aspect of college life, which might have included making new friends, participating in societies or clubs, and attending numerous social events, being back home can induce a sense of loneliness. 3. Changing Friend Circles: The relationships formed during freshman year may alter the relational dynamics Addison had before leaving for college. If their old friends moved on or changed significantly (or if Addison themselves changed), this could result in a sense of loneliness. 4. Lack of Active Engagement: At university, Addison is likely to be engaged in many activities, be it academic or extracurricular. However, back home, especially if it's during a break, they might not have as much to engage themselves, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. 5. Adjusting to the Home Environment: After a year of being independent and managing their own time and activities, moving back home might involve adjusting to family routines and expectations, which could be quite challenging and may result in feelings of loneliness. However, it's equally probable that Addison might feel relieved, relaxed, or happy after they finish their freshman year and return home. Therefore, the answer is largely dependent on the individual's subjective emotional experience. In conclusion, although we cannot definitely confirm that \\"like a lonely person\\" would be Addison's exact response, it can be considered a valid hypothetical response to your question considering the outlined situational factors. Yet, it's crucial to emphasize that there could be a multitude of other possible feelings associated with the given situation due to the subjective nature of emotions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These best friends since kindergarten share a love for summer and beach activities especially building sandcastles. The two kids spend the afternoon meticulously constructing their beach creations. They start by gathering wet sand near the water's edge, taking turns using their pink and yellow plastic shovels to fill up their matching pails. They chatter away excitedly discussing their design strategies; Emma wants a large castle fit for a queen while Lily prefers a complex design with numerous tall towers and a moat surrounding her fortress. They spend the next few hours deeply engrossed in their labor of love. The sandy blanket spread out in front of them is transformed into a landscape filled with grand castles, with each structure more elaborate than the last. Their determination and focus are unwavering, even as they simultaneously discuss their favorite books and cartoon characters. They agonize over the finest details, from the window placement to the criss-cross patterns on their castle walls, recreating images from fairy tales and princess stories they love so much. As the afternoon sun begins to wane and the sky paints a picture of pink and oranges, they integrate elements from the beach into their castle. Shimmering pebbles become walkways, shells turn into decorations adorning castle walls, and seaweed transforms into the greenery hanging from their stony parapets. Satisfied with their creative endeavors, they take a step back to admire their hard work. With a sense of accomplishment, they giggle, exchanging high-fives and compliments. They start creating stories, imagining themselves as princesses living in these spectacular sandcastles, battling sea monsters, hosting grand balls and leading their imaginary kingdoms with wisdom and kindness. As the day comes to an end, they sit beside their creations watching the tide begin to roll in. There's a momentary pang of sadness as they watch the sea begin to claim their sand masterpieces. However, the feeling quickly subsides when Lily suggests they can build an even bigger castle tomorrow. Their parents call them for dinner. They run laughing towards the picnic blanket laid out a little way from the water, leaving behind the swept-away remnants of their day's work. They promise each other to wake up early the next day and take on the challenge of building a more magnificent sandcastle.

He felt Congress should have books on all subjects, not just on law. This idea changed the library forever. The library grew and grew. Now it covers a large area of land. It contains20million books as well as many pictures, movies, globes and machines. Experts in every field work there. Hundreds of people call every day with all kinds of questions. Many of them get answers right over the phone. The library is a huge storehouse. Thomas Edison's first movie and Houdini's magic books are preserved there.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Thompson was born into a middle-class family in Louisville, Kentucky, the first of three sons of Virginia Ray Davison (1908, Springfield, Kentucky - March 20, 1998, Louisville), who worked as head librarian at the Louisville Free Public Library and Jack Robert Thompson (September 4, 1893, Horse Cave, Kentucky - July 3, 1952, Louisville), a public insurance adjuster and World War I veteran. His parents were introduced to each other by a friend from Jack's fraternity at the University of Kentucky in September 1934, and married on November 2, 1935. Thompson's first name came from a purported ancestor on his mother's side, the Scottish surgeon John Hunter. The book for which Thompson gained most of his fame had its genesis during the research for Strange Rumblings in Aztlan, an expose for Rolling Stone on the 1970 killing of the Mexican-American television journalist Ruben Salazar. Salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear gas canister fired by officers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War. One of Thompson's sources for the story was Oscar Zeta Acosta, a prominent Mexican-American activist and attorney. Finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Thompson and Acosta decided to travel to Las Vegas, and take advantage of an assignment by Sports Illustrated to write a 250-word photograph caption on the Mint 400 motorcycle race held there. What was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely. Thompson first submitted to Sports Illustrated a manuscript of 2,500 words, which was, as he later wrote, \\"aggressively rejected.\\" Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner was said to have liked \\"the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication -- which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it\\", Thompson later wrote. The result of the trip to Las Vegas became the 1972 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which first appeared in the November 1971 issues of Rolling Stone as a two-part series. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named Raoul Duke on a trip to Las Vegas with Dr. Gonzo, his \\"300-pound Samoan attorney\\", to cover a narcotics officers' convention and the \\"fabulous Mint 400\\". During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as \\"my attorney\\") become sidetracked by a search for the American Dream, with \\"two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers ... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls.\\" Coming to terms with the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement is a major theme of the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim, including being heralded by The New York Times as \\"by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope\\". \\"The Vegas Book\\", as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public. Did it get good reviews?","completion":"Yes, the book called \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" got good reviews. People really liked it.

A picture has emerged of gun victim Reeva Steenkamp blasting a pistol almost identical to the the one that killed her, at a firing range. Holding a steady arm, Reeva takes aim for the target, using both hands to clasp a 9mm handgun similar to the one South African police recovered from the home of Oscar Pistorius. The pretty blonde ensures she is fully prepared for the target practice, with ear muffs and protective glasses intact. Used to guns? This picture may give a clue into how aware Steenkamp was with the gun culture of South Africa. Evidence: A police officer holds the pistol that was allegedly used in the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp. The 'Blade Runner' is on bail awaiting trial for the murder of the former model after she was shot four times at his property on Valentine's Day. It is believed Pistorius' defence will be that he mistook her for an intruder. The picture could shed light on how connected Reeva was with guns, and that she was comfortable with her boyfriend owning one and keeping it in the house. The outing to the firing range is believe to have occurred some months before Steenkamp began dating London 2012 Olympian Pistorius. What's the story? Pistorius is on bail, accused of the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp (both pictured at an awards ceremony in Johannesburg) Guns are owned by many homeowners in Pretoria owing to the high-rate of crime, including burglary, and it is believed Pistorius owned more than one of the weapons, as well as keeping a cricket bat by his bed. Pistorius held a memorial service at his Uncle Arnold's house in Pretoria this week, and is believed to be ready to resume his training after asking for his bail conditions to be altered. It is thought that the trial could be up to a year in waiting after the double-amputee was granted bail after a two-hour court hearing a week ago. Desmond Nair, who reached the decision, deemed Pistorius not to be a flight risk, and was unlikely to commit further acts of violence when released from custody. Conditions. of his release include that he surrenders his passports and travel. documents, does not visit his house where the model died and does not. use any prohibited substances. He is also banned from drinking alcohol. Denial: Pistorius denies that he murdered his girlfriend, and his defence is expected to be that he thought she was an intruder. Pistorius, is charged with one count of premeditated murder over the February 14 killing of the FHM cover girl. He says the shooting was accidental because he thought she was a dangerous intruder inside his home. Mr Nair said Pistorius' affidavit, in which he gave his version of the events of the shooting in a sworn statement, had helped his application for bail in Pretoria Magistrate's Court. Rumours regarding the personal lives of the famous couple have been well documented. Needles and substances found at the property that were allegedly pointing towards testosterone injections have since being discounted as being used for a herbal remedy to aid muscle recovery.

Article: A new United Nations report shows that fish farming may soon be the world's most important provider of fish. The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. Question: We learn that since the year 2006, fish farming has been _ .

Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought. Which country had less acid precipitation fall in forests? Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.

Context: The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.

Write highlights for this article: The FBI announced Wednesday that it is working with Illinois state and local police to review evidence related to the 1982 Tylenol murders. James W. Lewis served time for sending a 1 million extortion note to Johnson & Johnson. \\"This review was prompted, in part, by the recent 25th anniversary of this crime and the resulting publicity,\\" the FBI said in a written statement. \\"Further, given the many recent advances in forensic technology, it was only natural that a second look be taken at the case and recovered evidence.\\" The anniversary coincided with a number of tips to law enforcement agencies related to the crimes, the FBI said. Agents on Wednesday searched the Cambridge, Massachusetts, house of James W. Lewis, who was convicted of sending an extortion note to Johnson & Johnson but denied having anything to do with the poisonings. Lewis's wife LeAnn is listed as administrator of a Web design company called Cyberlewis.com. Its Web site lists the company's address as the same address that authorities searched Wednesday. On its Web site is posted a note that says, in part, \\" ... I was villified (sic) globally as the Tylenol Man, accused of being the mass murderer who spiked Tylenol with cyanide in Chicago back in 1982, killing seven. Those grotesque accusations obviously were false, otherwise I could not be writing these words. After 25 years, the Tylenol murders remain unsolved.

FBI spokeswoman Gail Marcinkiewicz said two searches in Cambridge were under way \\"related to an ongoing investigation.\\" She would not say whether they were related to the Tylenol case. Criminal charges have not been filed in the seven Chicago-area killings, which occurred after Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules were laced with potassium cyanide. The killings led to changes in packaging of over-the-counter drugs. Johnson & Johnson, parent of the drug maker, McNeil, was widely credited for its aggressiveness in recalling the product and its openness in dealing with the killings, and the product quickly bounced back in sales. It remains a popular analgesic. \\"Johnson & Johnson cannot comment on the status of any ongoing investigation into the murders of 1982,\\" said company spokesman Jeff Leebaw.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation -68w + 134w = 84w - 54 for w, we first need to simplify and combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 1. Combine the w terms on the left side of the equation: (-68w + 134w) = 66w So, the equation becomes: 66w = 84w - 54 2. Next, we want to isolate the variable w by combining the w terms on both sides of the equation. We will do this by subtracting 66w from both sides: 66w - 66w = 84w - 54 - 66w Now, the left side of the equation becomes 0: 0 = 18w - 54 3. To isolate w further, we need to add 54 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 54 = 18w - 54 + 54 54 = 18w 4. Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 18 to solve for w: 54 ÷ 18 = 18w ÷ 18 5.

Answer the following question: Article: One day, a man found the cocoon of a butterfly and he brought it home. A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly! Question: What does the writer want to tell us?

Mr Hobby said 98% of schools were losing funding \\"at a time when costs are rising and pupil numbers are growing\\". \\"The government must take urgent action and commit to funding schools sufficiently in the next Budget. It is time to stop viewing education spending as a cost and to start seeing it as an investment in England's future, and in our children's.\\" Liam Collins head of Uplands Community College in Wadhurst, East Sussex, said budget pressures amounted to \\"a cut of 10 teachers, fewer clubs, no pastoral support, a narrowed curriculum, no counselling for students struggling with mental health issues, crumbling buildings, no IT upgrades, no new textbooks and no school planners. \\"Eventually this will impact on student outcomes.\\" Labour said the NAHT's survey showed ministers \\"continue to hide their heads in the sand\\" on school funding.

NATO aircraft targeted warships overnight, striking eight of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's vessels in Tripoli's seaport, the organization said Friday morning. A Libyan government official said the targets included commercial vessels as well as military ones. \\"All NATO's targets are military in nature and are directly linked to the Gadhafi regime's systematic attacks on the Libyan people,\\" said Rear Adm. Russell Harding, deputy commander of Operation Unified Protector. \\"Given the escalating use of naval assets, NATO had no choice but to take decisive action to protect the civilian population of Libya and NATO forces at sea.\\" In a statement, NATO said the attack occurred after two weeks of escalating use of government maritime forces that had disrupted the flow of humanitarian assistance. All the vessels targeted were naval warships with no civilian utility, said Harding. But a Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area said the commercial port, not the nearby military port, was hit. From the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area, it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit. The port's general manager, Mohammed Ahmed Rashed, told reporters that six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel, which had been in dock for maintenance. The port remained operational, he said. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called the attack a \\"clear attempt to bring the nation to its knees,\\" and said the port serves as the main entry point for food and other critical supplies into the country. \\"The nation will starve,\\" he said. Still, though the port was in disarray, the damage did not appear major, he said. Ibrahim's claims came as President Barack Obama, addressing a global audience, condemned the use of force against Arab Spring protesters by longtime allies and adversaries alike. \\"Obama is still delusional,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"He believes the lies that his own government is spreading around the world and his own media is spreading around the world. They have not proved one single charge against us and they refuse to investigate us.\\" He added, \\"It's not Obama who decides whether Moammar Gadhafi leaves Libya or not. It's the Libyan people who decide their future.\\" The report of the attack came shortly after at least three explosions could be heard in the city. A government official said five airstrikes had targeted the port and the police academy was also hit on Thursday, during which NATO jets could be seen been flying overhead throughout the day. Libyan state-run television reported the strikes with a \\"breaking news\\" font that said, \\"Military source: Residential and military locations in Tripoli are currently being shelled by NATO forces.\\" Earlier Thursday, crowds of Libyans took to the streets of Tripoli, honking horns and dancing in the streets in support of the country's leader, Moammar Gadhafi. More than 100 people outside the headquarters of state television chanted \\"God, Moammar and Libya only\\" and other pro-Gadhafi and anti-rebel slogans. The demonstrations were sparked, apparently, in response to state-run television reports that parts of the rebel capital Benghazi were \\"rejecting the colonialists and their followers,\\" as the government describes NATO and the rebels. A group of journalists, including a CNN team, was taken by government minders to see the celebrations in Tripoli. Among the crowds composed predominantly of young men were a number of families -- including fathers carrying children on their shoulders. One woman, who brought her 10-year-old-daughter, carried a portrait of the Libyan leader and said they were celebrating their country being united again. Many then drove toward Tripoli's Green Square singing and honking their horns, waving Libya's green flag and portraits of Gadhafi. But CNN journalists in Benghazi saw no indications of counter-revolutionary uprisings or protests there. And the National Transitional Council denied government claims that pro-Gadhafi forces had seized control of the city. And residents of Benghazi said they had not seen or heard of pro-Gadhafi rallies there. Two months ago, Gadhafi loyalists in Tripoli erupted in similar cheers when state media incorrectly reported that Tobruk and Benghazi had fallen to government troops. Gadhafi has been fighting to keep control of his country in the face of an uprising that has led to a number of key cities falling into rebel control. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court this week requested a warrant for Gadhafi's arrest on charges of crimes against humanity.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Pancreatic Secretion Regulation of pancreatic secretion is the job of hormones and the parasympathetic nervous system. The entry of acidic chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of secretin, which in turn causes the duct cells to release bicarbonaterich pancreatic juice. The presence of proteins and fats in the duodenum stimulates the secretion of CCK, which then stimulates the acini to secrete enzyme-rich pancreatic juice and enhances the activity of secretin. Parasympathetic regulation occurs mainly during the cephalic and gastric phases of gastric secretion, when vagal stimulation prompts the secretion of pancreatic juice. Usually, the pancreas secretes just enough bicarbonate to counterbalance the amount of HCl produced in the stomach. Hydrogen ions enter the blood when bicarbonate is secreted by the pancreas. Thus, the acidic blood draining from the pancreas neutralizes the alkaline blood draining from the stomach, maintaining the pH of the venous blood that flows to the liver.

Vienna saw it for the first time in 1994, at the Vienna Volksoper, in what John Rockwell in the New York Times described as \\"an awkwardly updated production\\", though well performed. The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916, performances had been rare compared with Europe. Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before reviving it. In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and staged it again in 1983 and 1986. Reviewing the 1986 production, Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the \\"melodic suppleness and warmth\\" of Bizet's score.San Diego Opera first staged the work in 1993, but it was this company's 2004 production, designed by Zandra Rhodes, that generated new levels of enthusiasm for the opera throughout the United States. In the following few years this production was shown in seven other U.S. opera houses; in October 2008 James C.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which cousin learned less about wildlife management? Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","completion":"It would be incorrect to state that one cousin learned less about wildlife management than the other, as both Liam and Fox learned about different aspects of food chains and ecosystems, which are interconnected and essential to understanding wildlife management. Liam, who read about apex predators, learned about the role of top predators in regulating ecosystems, population dynamics, and the health of other species within the food chain. This is an important aspect of wildlife management, as it highlights the need for conservation efforts that protect apex predators and maintain the population balance of an ecosystem. On the other hand, Fox learned about grazers and large herbivores, which are also crucial for understanding wildlife management. Grazers and large herbivores play a significant role in shaping ecosystems, as they promote plant diversity and maintain habitat structure. The trophic interactions between primary consumers and primary producers are essential for the overall health and functioning of an ecosystem. Knowing how these interactions work can provide insights for wildlife managers on the importance of maintaining the balance of different species and managing habitats effectively. Both aspects of food chains, apex predators and grazers/large herbivores, are integral for the comprehensive understanding of wildlife management strategies. While each cousin learned about a specific part of the ecosystem, they both contributed to the collective understanding of wildlife management. To obtain a more holistic comprehension, it would be ideal for Liam and Fox to share their knowledge and learn from each other, as both areas are important for effective wildlife management, conservation, and ecotourism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Teenagers are susceptible to changes of incentive structures insofar as they have the same cognitive abilities as adults . 4. Even if its true that they take less account for the incentives and prefer peer recognition , they still factor in the harsh sentences .","completion":"The debate topic for the given sentences can be framed as: \\"Do teenagers and juveniles respond rationally to incentives and disincentives, and can they be deterred from engaging in risky behaviors?\\" The sentences provided argue that: 1. Juvenile smoking behavior is negatively impacted by price, suggesting that increasing the cost of cigarettes would lead to a decrease in consumption among young people. This implies that they are responsive to incentives. 2. The decline in teenage pregnancies can be attributed to a combination of lower welfare benefits and an increased awareness of the risks associated with sexually transmitted diseases, such as AIDS. This again demonstrates that teenagers respond to incentives and can be deterred from engaging in risky behavior. 3. The assertion is made that teenagers have the same cognitive abilities as adults and are therefore capable of assessing and reacting to changes in incentive structures. 4. It is argued that even if teenagers prioritize peer recognition over incentives, they still take into account the consequences of their actions, such as legal penalties, and adjust their behavior accordingly. In summary, the central debate topic revolves around the capacity of teenagers and juveniles to make rational decisions based on incentives and disincentives, and whether these factors can effectively deter them from engaging in risky behaviors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Movie critic Ava DuVernay’s adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time” arrives with more than its share of hype, generated by fans dedicated to Madeleine L’Engle’s 1962 children’s book as well as by DuVernay’s distinction as the first African American woman to direct a movie with a 100 million budget. At a recent screening, the filmmaker herself seemed eager to manage expectations. In a taped prologue, DuVernay urged filmgoers to watch the movie while in touch with their “inner child,” a useful piece of advice for a movie that turns out to be a kids’ film, for better and for worse. “A Wrinkle in Time” may not be an epic game-changer on par with “Wonder Woman” and “Black Panther,” to which it has already been unfairly compared. Yet this pleasing if modest fantasy ad­ven­ture possesses all the strengths and weaknesses of its source material, with DuVernay’s sensibility suffusing the enterprise with a timely sense of urgency and relevance. Perhaps DuVernay’s most canny move lies in her casting, which involves some familiar faces reframed in fantastical dimensions, as well as marvelous discoveries. Storm Reid plays Meg Murry, the 14-year-old misfit who’s been in a perpetual bad mood since her physicist father, Alex (Chris Pine), disappeared four years ago. Living in her cozy Compton home with her scientist mother, Kate (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), and 5-year-old brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), Meg isn’t nearly as comfortable at school, where she’s chronically bullied by the resident mean girls. [Why Ava DuVernay is exactly what we need right now] Things change when a mysterious woman named Mrs. Whatsit visits on a dark and stormy night, setting Meg, Charles Wallace and Meg’s school friend Calvin (Levi Miller) on a search for Alex that will take them to the furthest reaches of the universe. Aided by Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, Meg gets in touch with her powers, culminating in nothing less than a fight between good and evil. Watch out, Storm’s ahead: Storm Reid is excellent as Meg, the outsider 14-year-old at the heart of the story. (Walt Disney Pictures) Delivering a sturdy, self-possessed performance as “A Wrinkle in Time’s” heroine, Reid proves a thoroughly capable leading lady, her slightly nerdish appeal something of a twin to Letitia Wright’s precocious young scientist in “Black Panther.” (Let’s hear it for Girls Who Code.) If the original character’s rough edges have been over-sanded here, Reid is still convincing as a girl who’s angry and grieving over the loss of a pivotal figure in her life, both defiant and afraid of putting a foot wrong. [Beloved books can turn into terrible movies. Will ‘A Wrinkle in Time’ beat the odds?] McCabe, for his part, plays the preternaturally confident Charles Wallace with scene-stealing glee, his little-man maturity modulating into something far more troubling as Meg’s journey grows more perilous. If Miller has less material to work with as Calvin, he gracefully cedes the limelight to the brother-sister act. All three young people more than hold their own when they’re being towered over — literally — by the three Mrs. W’s, portrayed by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling and Oprah Winfrey, respectively. [Publishers rejected her, Christians attacked her: Madeleine L’Engle and faith] Decked out in magnificent wigs and gowns, their lips and eyes bedazzled with metallic makeup sure to launch a thousand YouTube tutorials, Witherspoon, Kaling and Winfrey show up and disappear with sometimes perfunctory suddenness. (Like Calvin, they’re also stranded with little to do except, literally, stand there and slay in a procession of otherworldly looks.) “A Wrinkle in Time” is plagued by the same convoluted leaps and hurried lack of logic that Washington Post critic Michael Dirda recently pointed out in L’Engle’s original book. At a time when movies are almost uniformly too long, this is one film that could have benefited from a few more scenes to plump up Meg’s backstory, solidify the emotional stakes and smooth out transitions that are jagged at best, nonsensical at worst. [‘A Wrinkle in Time’: Let’s hope the movie is better than the book] Still, with its bright color palette, appealing lead players and moments of comic relief — Zach Galifianakis shows up to play a rather anxious Happy Medium — “A Wrinkle in Time” is often beautiful to watch. (Sequences amid the Skittles-hued conformity of the planet Camazotz are particularly well staged.) And DuVernay injects subtle cues that remind viewers of the story’s revolutionary potential that was so incendiary 50 years ago that some institutions once banned the book. There’s a lovely shot, early in the movie, when Charles Wallace waits in the principal’s office, his posture echoed by James Baldwin in a photo hanging on the wall. In L’Engle’s original telling, Mrs. Who quoted the likes of Shakespeare, Dante and Euripides; DuVernay adds epigrams from Rumi, Outkast and Lin-Manuel Miranda. As a clarion call for young people rising up against the forces of cynicism, corruption and wanton cruelty, “A Wrinkle in Time” feels decidedly of-the-moment, a primer for the little brothers and sisters of the #NeverAgain generation. Even without every flaw completely ironed out, it offers values worth celebrating across the time-space continuum.

(Atsushi Nishijima/Walt Disney Pictures) ||||| But actually, it’s a rather sweet and charming old-fashioned story about a quest and the age-old battle between good and evil. Teenage Meg (12 Years a Slave’s Storm Reid) is having a rough time at school with one particularly nasty “mean girl” while suffering — along with Mom and younger brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) — the loss of their physicist dad, Alex, who disappeared down a rabbit hole of sorts (quantum physics-wise) four years earlier. Charles, a strange and brilliant child, has a plan to find him, involving using three rather unusual spirit guides, Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, to take him and Meg and her friend Calvin (Levi Miller), across time and space to bring back dear old Dad. It’s a Disney film with a 100-million-plus budget so expect top-notch CGI, imaginatively rendered sets and costumes and a really great cast. The story itself — adapted from that of the classic young-adult novel by Madeleine L’Engle — is a bit confusing (unless you’re a physicist) so don’t spent too much worrying about the fine details and go along for the ride, which is emotionally charged, tension-filled and ultimately satisfying. What raises the film up isn’t the splendidly rendered special effects or the big star names such as Oprah Winfrey as Mrs. Which (and Mindy Kaling as Mrs. Who) or even Chris Pine, who’s mostly absent as Dad. It’s the wonderful and surprisingly mature performances of the three young principals. ||||| Published on Nov 19, 2017 On March 9th, be a warrior.

Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/WrinkleinTime Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/wrinkleintime/ Hashtag: #WrinkleinTime From visionary director Ava DuVernay comes Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time,” an epic adventure based on Madeleine L’Engle’s timeless classic which takes audiences across dimensions of time and space, examining the nature of darkness versus light and, ultimately, the triumph of love. Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light. Directed by Emmy(R) winner and Oscar(R) and Golden Globe(R) nominee Ava DuVernay from a screenplay by Oscar winner Jennifer Lee based upon the beloved novel by Madeleine L’Engle, “A Wrinkle in Time” stars: two-time Academy Award(R) nominee Oprah Winfrey, Oscar and Emmy winner Reese Witherspoon, Emmy nominee Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Peňa and introducing Storm Reid, with two-time Emmy winner Zach Galifianakis and Emmy nominee Chris Pine. Produced by Jim Whitaker and Catherine Hand with Doug Merrifield serving as executive producer, the film also boasts an impressive creative team featuring some of the most talented artisans working today, including: Tobias Schliessler, ASC as director of photography, Naomi Shohan as production designer, Oscar(R)-nominee Spencer Averick as film editor, two-time Academy Award(R)-nominee Paco Delgado as costume designer and four time Emmy(R) nominee Ramin Djawadi as composer. ||||| The other two supernatural beings are not as effective. Mrs Whatsit in the book is a tiny little old woman, while Mrs Which is, well, a witch. Reese Witherspoon plays Mrs Whatsit in the movie, and is not a little old woman but instead a beautiful and slightly mean character with long red hair who transforms into a gigantic cabbage creature. Mrs Which, the most powerful of the trio, is played by Oprah Winfrey. It’s a Winfrey-ish role, as she stands slightly apart from the human world and dispenses warm wisdom from her lofty and grand position in the universe. But that performance gives the slightly unfortunate effect of Oprah Winfrey playing Oprah Winfrey in this troubled girl’s life. L’Engle’s book derives its magic from refracting and magnifying Meg’s pain, anger, and impotent rage into a fantasy quest. As in Labyrinth, another children’s classic, the challenges ahead reflect the problems in her life. She fears that the father has abandoned the family, and is furious at him for disappearing. She rails against adults with power and cries and stamps her feet—until she realizes that it is harder, but more powerful, to make decisions on your own. The three magical beings that guide her on her mission lead her to that conclusion as much as to her lost father: “We want nothing from you that you do without grace,” Mrs Whatsit says, “or that you do without understanding.”’ It’s a gorgeous lesson. The problem with A Wrinkle in Time comes from its art direction. DuVernay conjures some fantastical scenes, especially on the beautiful planet Uriel. But instead of the book’s dreaminess, Uriel is so bright and polished that it resembles a screensaver. Its topography is reminiscent of Avatar. There’s a sweet patch of flowers that communicate with the young travelers in a cloud of twittering petals. But again, they are so neon that they look videogame-ish, rather than like a dream. DuVernay has also updated the disturbing Camazotz, the evil planet in A Wrinkle in Time where Meg’s father is lost. In the book, the planet contains a terrifyingly regulated city where all kids have to bounce a ball in time with each other, and workers come and go from their office buildings at exactly the same time and with identical briefcases. It’s an administrative dystopia that’s flavored strongly by Orwell and Huxley. In the movie, DuVernay uses nightmare scenarios that are more familiar to children. Instead of being scared in an office building, they’re disoriented on an extremely crowded beach. DuVernay keeps the kids bouncing balls, but she has them bounce in a very slightly irregular rhythm that ups the dread factor. If I’m playing up the little details that mark DuVernay’s skill as a director, it’s because I simply have no idea how today’s children will interpret her world in its entirety. Doubtless, it’s a great thing to have more protagonists of color, and DuVernay has achieved much in her casting and her innovations. But that issue of texture stayed with me throughout the movie, and it emptied out this world of its magic. Is imagination just a different game for kids now? As a critic, it may be that I don’t have the means to evaluate a work of art that’s supposed to be magical, because I can’t retrofit my childhood to one colored by Disney Channel super-saturation. But this movie relied so heavily on the glinting plastic toolbox of CGI that the magic just never arrived. The kid in me left the theater sadly disappointed. ||||| If there’s a secret to a successful screen adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time,” it’s still secret. Disney’s version of the Madeleine L’Engle young-adult novel is a magical mystery tour minus the magic and mystery, and a great disappointment, since there were so many reasons to root for the film’s success. It’s a racially diverse production with elaborate sci-fi trappings centered on Meg Murry (Storm Reid), a smart, brave girl who is searching distant planets for her vanished father. It’s also the first time a black woman, Ava DuVernay, has directed a megabudget studio spectacular.

Throughout her journey, Meg learns about bravery, individuality and the power of good over evil. The film was made with a big budget and features a diverse cast and beautiful, colorful special effects. But, much like the original book, the movie sometimes has parts that can be confusing and may have needed a few more scenes to make certain parts more clear.

Article:","completion":"Title: Tensions Rise as Oil Shipping Lane Crisis and Political Conflicts Intensify Between the US and Iran Introduction: The world's most critical oil shipping lane, a four-mile-wide strait, has become the center of attention following false reports of its closure, causing a substantial leap in the price of crude oil. Additionally, increasing political tensions between the US and Iran continue to escalate, with Vice President Cheney calling for an airstrike in response to Iran's refusal to hand back a downed spy plane and Iran fuming over the Congress calls for the assassination of key members of their Revolutionary Guard. 1. The Importance of the Four-Mile-Wide Strait: The four-mile-wide strait in question is a vital artery for global oil transportation, playing a significant role in the global economy. Any disruption or closure of this strategic shipping lane could have wide-ranging ramifications on oil prices worldwide, making the situation even more delicate amid the rising tensions between Iran and the United States. 2. Inaccurate Reports of Strait Closure and Effect on Oil Prices: False reports of the critical shipping lane being closed off have already caused a spike in crude oil prices. These inaccurate claims demonstrate how sensitive oil markets can be in the face of geopolitical uncertainties and potential threats to supply chains. It is crucial that the international community and relevant stakeholders work together to ensure the stability of the global oil transportation networks. 3. Vice President Cheney Advocates for Airstrike After Downed Spy Plane: The stakes in the ongoing conflict between the US and Iran have been further raised as Vice President Cheney calls for an airstrike on Iranian territory. This move comes after Iran's refusal to return a captured American spy plane, adding more complexity to the already-tense relationship between the two nations. 4. Iranian Response to Congress Calls for Assassinations: Iran has reacted with fury over the US Congress' appeal to assassinate key figures within their Revolutionary Guard. This provocative move not only exacerbates the existing animosity between Iran and the US but also risks further destabilizing the region and fueling additional retaliation from Iran. Conclusion: The mounting geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran continue to have significant implications on both domestic and international fronts. The importance of the four-mile-wide strait as a vital oil shipping lane and the inflammatory nature of political moves such as calls for assassination and airstrikes make it essential for both parties to work diligently to de-escalate the situation. It is in the best interest of global stability and economic security for the US and Iran to find a diplomatic resolution to their ongoing disputes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Evey Hammond, a young and ambitious woman, starts her career as a junior journalist and producer at BTN, hoping to make an impact with her journalism skills. Step 2: Setting up the conflict As Evey becomes more involved in her work at BTN, she discovers that the network has an underlying darker agenda – they control public opinion using manipulative news and content production to support their political allies and crush dissenting voices. Step 3: Evey's inner conflict As she slowly uncovers the truth behind BTN's actions, Evey faces an inner conflict – should she simply keep her head down and try to climb the ranks within the BTN without compromising her values, or should she risk everything to expose the network's hidden illicit political ties and manipulation of the masses. Step 4: Building alliances Evey forms a friendship and alliance with her colleague at BTN, Adrian, who shares her concerns about the organization's unethical behavior. Together, they start to investigate and gather evidence to unveil the corruption inside BTN. Step 5: A turning point To maintain their control, BTN executives decide to move forward with a plan that would further stifle the independence of other news outlets, endangering the very essence of free press. Evey and Adrian realize that the time to act is now, or else it may be too late. Step 6: Exposing the truth The two brave journalists use their access to the network's live broadcast system to broadcast damning evidence of BTN's dark side to the entire nation. They reveal secret agreements with powerful politicians and unveil the ways in which BTN manipulates information to distort public perception. Step 7: Aftermath The revelation sends shockwaves through the country, leading to widespread protests and a call for transparency in the media. Evey and Adrian are now regarded as heroes for their courageous actions and use their newfound influence to further the cause of freedom of the press and to fight against corruption in media organizations. Step 8: Ending Despite their initial success, Evey and Adrian understand that the fight is far from over, as powerful figures behind the scenes would still attempt to suppress the truth and manipulate the masses. With a renewed sense of purpose, they vow to continue their fight for the freedom of the press and a more just society. In conclusion, \\"Shadows of the Network\\" is a gripping story of Evey Hammond's struggle to expose the corrupt British Television Network (BTN). By creating alliances with her colleague Adrian and risking their careers, they work together to bring the truth to light and fight for a better, more transparent society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It has long been suspected that rhyolites from the northern Preseli Hills helped build the monument. But research by National Museum Wales and Leicester University has identified their source to within 70m (230ft) of Craig Rhos-y-felin, near Pont Saeson. The museum's Dr Richard Bevins said the find would help experts work out how the stones were moved to Wiltshire. For nine months Dr Bevins, keeper of geology at National Museum Wales, and Dr Rob Ixer of Leicester University collected and identified samples from rock outcrops in Pembrokeshire to try to find the origins of rhyolite debitage rocks that can be found at Stonehenge. By detailing the mineral content and the textural relationships within the rock, a process known as petrography, they found that 99% of the samples could be matched to rocks found in this particular set of outcrops. Rhyolitic rocks at Rhos-y-felin, between Ffynnon-groes (Crosswell) and Brynberian, differ from all others in south Wales, they said, which helps locate almost all of Stonehenge's rhyolites to within hundreds of square metres. Within that area, the rocks differ on a scale of metres or tens of metres, allowing Dr Bevins and Dr Ixer to match some Stonehenge rock samples even more precisely to a point at the extreme north-eastern end of Rhos-y-felin. Dr Rob Ixer of Leicester University called the discovery of the source of the rocks \\"quite unexpected and exciting\\". \\"Being able to provenance any archaeologically significant rock so precisely is remarkable,\\" he said. \\"However, given continued perseverance, we are determined that we shall uncover the origins of most, if not all of the Stonehenge bluestones so allowing archaeologists to continue their speculations well into a third century.\\" With the location identified, archaeologists will now be able to dig to try and uncover how the stones from Pembrokeshire reached Stonehenge. \\"Many have asked the question over the years, how the stones got from Pembrokeshire to Stonehenge,\\" said Dr Bevins. \\"Was it human transport? Was it due to ice transport? \\"Thanks to geological research, we now have a specific source for the rhyolite stones from which to work and an opportunity for archaeologists to answer the question that has been widely debated. \\"It is important now that the research continues.\\" Work is continuing to identify the source of four other stones at Stonehenge which do not come from Rhos-y-felin, he said. Experts have long theorised on how the stones were transported from Pembrokeshire to the Stonehenge site when the monument was built from around 3000 BC to 1600 BC. Perceived wisdom had it that the giant slabs were moved via raft, up the Bristol Channel and River Avon. But as Pont Saeson is to the north of the Preselis some believe its unlikely that they would have been able to navigate the terrain in order to get the enormous rocks to the coast. An alternative theory was that nature drove the stone to Stonehenge, in the path of an Ice Age glacier, although the absence of any other Welsh rock in the region seemed to have ruled out the possibility. In April 2000 a National Lottery Heritage Lottery Fund plan was launched to replicate the 240-mile (386 km) journey of a giant stone from west Wales to Salisbury Plain, by land and sea. The millennium bluestone project, which tried to use only muscle power and the technology of the ancients, ended in disaster when the stone sank in Milford Haven estuary.

The researchers from National Museum Wales and Leicester University discovered that these rocks came from a place called Craig Rhos-y-felin, near Pont Saeson, in Wales. They studied the rocks very carefully to find out where they came from. This discovery is important because now experts can try to figure out how the big rocks were moved from Wales to Stonehenge in England a long time ago. Some people think they were carried on boats, while others think ice might have moved them during the Ice Age. Now that the researchers know exactly where the rocks are from, they can study the area and try to find clues to solve this mystery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the late 1980's, Personal Best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as a more than experimental phase of Cahill's life. It seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same-sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole. This random scene had VERY LITTLE relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie. I suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie (the 1980 Oregon Track and Field Competition).

Mash your words together and spread your vowels out for the Long Island classic accent. Use some local, if cliched, colloquialisms. Listen to native New Yorkers, online or in person, to get the subtle range of different accents.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Mastering the Classic Long Island Accent: Tips, Techniques, and Insights Introduction The Long Island accent, a distinct dialect native to Long Island, New York, is famous for its often exaggerated and dramatic inflections. Whether you're an actor preparing for a role, a linguist studying dialects, or simply someone who enjoys mimicking accents, achieving the perfect Long Island accent can be a fun and rewarding challenge. In this article, we'll delve into the nuances of the Long Island accent and provide practical tips on how to speak like a true native New Yorker. The Roots of the Long Island Accent The Long Island accent is a variation of the broader New York accent, which itself has roots in the varied ethnicities and cultural influences that have shaped the region over the centuries. The accent is most heavily influenced by Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants who settled in the area during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result of these diverse origins, there is a wide range of accents and dialects within the broader New York accent, from the nasally Bronx dialect to the more extravagant Long Island variant. Key Components of the Long Island Accent 1. Nasal and constricted speech One of the most distinctive characteristics of the classic Long Island accent is its nasally, almost constricted quality. To achieve this, try speaking as if your throat is slightly tight, forcing the sound to come more from your nasal passages than down in your chest. This might take some practice, but it is an essential aspect of the accent. 2. Attitude and speech rhythms Another common feature of the Long Island accent is a certain attitude and distinct rhythm in speech. Long Islanders tend to embody a unique blend of confidence, assertiveness, and a touch of brashness in their vocal patterns. Experiment with your tone and delivery, and practice emphasizing certain syllables within a sentence to create a more dynamic and engaging speaking style. 3. Mashed words and elongated vowels Pronunciation plays a big role in perfecting the Long Island accent. Often, words are spoken with a rushed or \\"mashed\\" quality, as if blending multiple syllables into a singular sound. For example, \\"Long Island\\" might be pronounced as \\"Lawn Guyland,\\" or \\"morning\\" as \\"mawnin.\\" Additionally, some vowels are stretched out or elongated, such as the \\"aw\\" sound in \\"law\\" or \\"coffee\\" being pronounced as \\"caw-fee.\\" 4. Local colloquialisms To truly capture the Long Island accent, it's crucial to sprinkle your speech with some local, albeit sometimes cliched, colloquialisms. Phrases like \\"fuhgeddaboudit,\\" \\"yooz guyz,\\" and \\"mad good\\" can help add authenticity to your accent while demonstrating your familiarity with the local vernacular. 5. Listen and learn from native New Yorkers Immersing yourself in the sounds and speech patterns of native Long Islanders is perhaps the most important aspect of mastering the accent. It's possible to find a wealth of resources online, including interviews and videos featuring residents of the region. Additionally, consider visiting Long Island and engaging in conversation with locals to further hone your skills and pick up on the subtle variations within the accent. Conclusion The Long Island accent is a colorful and unique dialect that reflects the rich history and cultural influences of the region. By practicing nasal and constricted speech patterns, adopting the attitude and rhythms of the dialect, mashing your words, elongating vowels, and incorporating colloquialisms, you'll be well on your way to perfecting the Long Island accent. So, go ahead – give it a whirl, and soon enough, you'll be sounding like a true native New Yorker!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W.

From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The Barack Obama Academy of International Studies , also known as Pittsburgh Obama 6 - 12 , is a public school in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Patriots, the Steelers went home for a Week 15 duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars. In the first quarter, Pittsburgh trailed early as Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 36-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Steelers took the lead as QB Ben Roethlisberger completed an 18-yard TD pass to TE Heath Miller. Jacksonville regained the lead as QB David Garrard completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Ernest Wilford. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh fell further behind as Garrard completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Williams and a 55-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt. The extra point attempts on both of these touchdowns failed. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers rallied to tie the game with Roethlisberger completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Hines Ward and a 30-yard TD pass to WR Nate Washington, with the later being followed by WR Cedric Wilson completing a 2-point conversion pass to WR Santonio Holmes on a trick play. On the Jaguars' ensuing offensive drive RB Fred Taylor scored on a 12-yard TD run.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 12*m + 6 - 18 = 0 for m.","completion":"Sure, let's break down the solution for this equation step by step. The original equation is: 12*m + 6 - 18 = 0 First, we will need to simplify the right side of the equation by combining like terms. 6 - 18 simplifies to -12. This results in the equation: 12*m - 12 = 0 The next step is to get rid of the -12 on the left side of the equation in order to isolate our variable m. In order to do that, we will add 12 to both sides of the equation. This cancels out the -12 on the left side and adds 12 to the right side. The equation now becomes: 12*m = 12 In order to find m, we now need to free it from being multiplied by 12. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 12. As we perform the same operation on both sides of the equation, this maintains the balance of the equation. m = 12 / 12 The twelve on both sides cancels out, leaving us with: m = 1 So, the solution to the equation 12*m + 6 - 18 = 0 is m = 1. That means that when we substitute 1 for m in the original equation, it should balance both sides of the equation. Checking our work: 12*1 + 6 - 18 = 0 12 + 6 - 18 = 0 -6 + 6 = 0 0 = 0 Our solution is confirmed. m = 1 is indeed the correct solution to this problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.

Movie title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination.

Write an article based on this summary: Steel giant Tata has warned that a new carbon tax announced in the Budget dealt the industry \\"a potentially severe blow\\".","completion":"Title: Steel Giant Tata Expresses Concern Over New Carbon Tax Introduction: The steel industry has been significantly impacted by various economic, environmental, and regulatory challenges in recent years. Tata Steel, one of the world's leading steel producers, has voiced serious concerns over the newly announced carbon tax in the Budget. The company has described the tax as \\"a potentially severe blow\\" to the industry, raising questions about the future competitiveness and sustainability of steel production. Step 1: Explain the context of the new carbon tax To understand Tata Steel's concerns, it is important to consider the context of the announced carbon tax. This fiscal measure is part of a broader strategy to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Governments and regulatory bodies across the globe have been implementing various carbon pricing mechanisms to incentivize industries to transition towards cleaner technologies and more sustainable practices. Step 2: Elaborate on Tata Steel's concerns Tata Steel's main concern is the potential negative impact of the carbon tax on the company's financial health. The tax will likely lead to increased production costs, which could affect the company's profit margins. In an industry characterized by tight margins and intense competition, any additional financial burden presents a significant challenge. Furthermore, the company fears that the carbon tax may hinder its ability to compete in global markets, particularly against steel manufacturers from countries with laxer environmental regulations and lower carbon taxes. This could ultimately result in job losses and negatively affect the economic development of regions where Tata Steel operates. Step 3: Address potential implications for the steel industry Tata Steel's concerns point to broader implications for the steel industry as a whole. The additional financial pressures imposed by the carbon tax may; 1. Prompt the industry to search for innovative solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining cost competitiveness. This could lead to investments in research and development to discover new materials, processes, and technologies. 2. Encourage consolidation and collaboration within the industry, as companies may need to join forces to manage the financial implications of the tax and innovate more effectively. 3. Potentially cause some steel manufacturers to exit the market if they are unable to adapt to the changing regulatory landscape, which could negatively affect local economies and employment opportunities. Step 4: Discuss possible solutions for Tata Steel and the industry To mitigate the potential negative impacts of the carbon tax, Tata Steel and other steel manufacturers should focus on: 1. Accelerating the development and adoption of cleaner technologies, such as electric arc furnaces and hydrogen-based processes, which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in steel production. 2. Collaborating with government and regulatory bodies to ensure that carbon pricing policies are consistent and fair, minimizing the risk of competitiveness imbalances across industries and geographical regions. 3. Embracing circular economy principles by improving recycling processes, extending product lifecycles, and reducing waste generated during the production process. Conclusion: While the new carbon tax announcement poses challenges for Tata Steel and the steel industry as a whole, it is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the sector. By investing in cleaner technologies, embracing circular economy principles, and engaging in constructive dialogue with stakeholders, the industry can address these challenges and contribute to a more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bills managed to get the only score of the first half, a 33-yard field goal by kicker Rian Lindell in the first quarter. It wasn't until the third quarter that the Bills were to score again when quarterback J. P. Losman threw a 4-yard pass to Josh Reed, while Lindell kicked a pair of FGs, a 45-yarder and a 43-yarder. Even though the Dolphins did manage to score in the fourth quarter on a 23-yard pass from Daunte Culpepper to Chris Chambers (with a failed 2-point conversion), the Bills defense dominated the game, sacking Culpepper seven times (along with two forced fumbles) and blocking a punt, improving the Bills to 1-1.

Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine died Sunday, her longtime friend Noel Beutel said Monday. She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Japan\\" correctly answer the question \\"Which two countries did Fontaine live in?\\"?","completion":"Based on the paragraph, the response \\"Japan\\" only partially answers the question \\"Which two countries did Fontaine live in?\\".

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington. Question: \\"Why did the FAA and White House teleconferences fail to stop the plane from hitting the Pentagon?\\" Response: \\"The FAA didn't join until 9:40\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the paragraph. The paragraph states that the FAA joined the White House video teleconference at 9:40, and by this time, the Pentagon had already been hit. This indicates that the FAA and White House teleconferences failed to stop the plane from hitting the Pentagon, which could be attributed to the lack of proper coordination and communication between the FAA and Defense Department on the teleconferences. Additionally, the paragraph also mentions that the NMCC officer and the FAA manager both agreed that the hijacking teleconference set up at 9:20 played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, I want to tell you a story about a country called Britain where some policemen have found that there are more people from other countries doing bad things than before. Once upon a time, in 2008, this country had fewer people from different countries doing naughty things. But now, the number of these wrong acts has become two-times bigger! That's like having one chocolate and now having two chocolates - but instead of chocolates, it's people doing things they shouldn't. The policemen in Britain have a special team called the \\"Home Office.\\" They try to send away the people who did bad things back to their own countries. But, it's not an easy job! Sometimes, they can't send away one out of five people. Imagine, if you have five apples and someone asks you to give all of them away, but you can only give away four apples, that's kind of like what's happening with the Home Office. They can't always send people away who did wrong. Now, there's an important police officer in Britain, and he has an important job to do! He tells everyone that the way they handle wrongdoers needs to change. They need to find better ways to make sure people who did bad things face what they have done. Just like how sometimes in school, the teacher changes the rules to make things better for everyone, the justice system in Britain also has to change its rules to help the country.

Among them, Antarctica is the most special one. It is a world of snow and ice all year round. China has sent many scientists there. They try to find resources under the icy land and study climate change and sea biology. What do they eat? Scientists don't have many choices on what they eat. About 60% their food is frozen food. It is easy to heat . Meat is common on the menu, while vegetables are not usual. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, people often eat dried and canned vegetables. How do they sleep? In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this time, Antarctica faces the sun and gets sunlight 24 hours of the day. In order to get some sleep,scientists cover the window with black cloth to make \\"night\\". How do they work? People can wear warm clothes to be against the cold weather, but they can do little with the strong wind. Sometimes, the wind is even stronger than a typhoon. It can easily blow people away. So there are ropes that connect some research stations. People can hold these ropes to keep balance in strong winds. How do they keep in touch with others? There are no cables or Internet on the frozen continent. So mobiles and computers don't work there. Scientists usually use two-way radios to communicate at work. If they want to say hello to family and friends, they can use the satellite phones. Question: What do scientists do in Antarctica? Answer: A:","completion":"In Antarctica, scientists carry out various research and exploration activities focusing on understanding the unique environment, resources, climate change, and sea biology. They seek to find resources beneath the frozen land, study the impact of climate change on the Antarctic ecosystem, as well as investigate patterns of marine life and their ecological roles. Apart from conducting research, scientists in Antarctica must also face and adapt to the challenging living conditions present on the continent. Their diet consists primarily of frozen food, with meat being a common feature and fresh vegetables being scarce due to the difficulty in growing them in the harsh climate. Sleeping can be challenging as well due to the 24-hour sunlight during the summer months. To create a \\"night\\" environment, they cover their windows with black cloths. Moreover, working in Antarctica requires coping with extremely cold weather and strong winds, at times stronger than typhoons. To maintain balance in such conditions, ropes that connect research stations are used by the scientists. Communicating in Antarctica presents another challenge as there are no cables or internet on the continent. Scientists rely on two-way radios to communicate during their work and use satellite phones to connect with their family and friends back home. Overall, working in Antarctica provides scientists with the opportunity to conduct crucial research and collect valuable data while adapting to the extreme living conditions of this exceptionally cold and isolated part of the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","completion":"Wood has played a significant role in dental hygiene throughout history, primarily through the use of wooden toothpicks and chew sticks. In the context of the statement provided, the answer to \\"How does wood contribute to dental hygiene?\\" can be found in the mention of toothpicks and utensils. Wooden toothpicks are small, thin, pointed tools used to remove food debris from between teeth, which helps in maintaining oral cleanliness. When used properly, toothpicks can support gum health and prevent dental problems such as cavities and periodontal disease. Another wood-based dental hygiene instrument is the chew stick, also known as a miswak stick or neem stick. These natural toothbrushes have been used for centuries in different cultures, usually sourced from trees with antibacterial and teeth-cleaning properties. Users chew on one end of the stick until the fibers loosen, then brush their teeth with the softened fibers. Chew sticks help to clean teeth, reduce plaque build-up, and freshen breath, all while having a gentle, natural abrasive effect. In summary, wood contributes to dental hygiene through the use of wooden toothpicks for removing food particles and the traditional practice of using chew sticks as natural toothbrushes for cleaning teeth and maintaining overall oral health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary decided to grow hydroponic lettuce on her farm and hired Carrie to design the system.","completion":"As Carrie began planning the hydroponic lettuce farm, she decided to take a step-by-step approach to ensure the design met Mary's expectations along with being sustainable and efficient. Step 1: Assessing Space and Location Carrie surveyed Mary's farm to understand the available space and the optimal location for the hydroponic system. She considered factors such as sunlight exposure, accessibility for farmworkers, and proximity to water and electricity sources. Carrie noted these aspects and decided to set up the hydroponic system in a corner of the farm that had ample sunlight and was close to a water source. Step 2: Selecting the Hydroponic System Carrie researched different hydroponic systems to determine the best one for growing lettuce. She considered factors like cost, scalability, and ease of maintenance. After evaluating various options, she decided on a Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system, as it was well-suited for growing leafy greens like lettuce and allowed for efficient use of water and nutrients. Step 3: Preparing the Budget and Procuring Materials Carrie prepared a detailed budget for the project, including the cost of construction materials, water, nutrients, seeds, and other necessary supplies. She also took labor costs into account and presented her budget proposal to Mary for approval. Once the budget was agreed upon, Carrie identified reliable suppliers for procuring all the necessary materials and placed an order. Step 4: Constructing the System With the help of a skilled labor team, Carrie started constructing the NFT hydroponic system. She ensured the channels were placed at a slight angle to facilitate the flow of nutrient-rich water over the plant roots. She also installed a filtration system, pumps, and air stones to maintain optimal water and nutrient circulation and aeration. Step 5: Planting and Monitoring After thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing the system, Carrie planted lettuce seeds in small rockwool cubes and placed them in the NFT channels. She closely monitored the growth of the lettuce and adjusted nutrient levels, water pH, and temperature as needed to promote healthy and rapid growth. Step 6: Harvesting and Maintenance Carrie trained Mary and her farmworkers in the proper techniques for harvesting the hydroponic lettuce, ensuring that the plants were not damaged in the process. She also educated them on routine maintenance tasks, such as cleaning the system, replacing water, and replenishing nutrients, to ensure the longevity of the hydroponic system. Carrie's thoughtful and strategic approach to designing the hydroponic lettuce farm proved successful, as Mary's farm soon became known for producing some of the freshest, tastiest, and most sustainably grown lettuce in the community. Not only did this endeavor generate a new income stream for Mary, but it also inspired other local farmers to adopt similar hydroponic systems on their own farms."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But without hefty carrier subsidies, will they ever be able to crack the U.S. market? Are American consumers ready for pricier cell phones that come without two-year wireless contracts? There's no question that when it comes to features, Nokia and Sony Ericsson's new U.S.-ready phones can easily compete against the hottest new phones on the market. Nokia's N97, a touch screen phone that supports both 3G and Wi-Fi, has a 5-megapixel camera and 32GB of memory. It's a clear competitor to the new Apple iPhone 3G S and the Palm Pre. The Sony Ericsson W995a, also a 3G and Wi-Fi enabled phone, comes with an 8.1-megapixel camera, a brilliant display screen, a good media player and features such as stereo Bluetooth, and GPS. In terms of features and functionality, this phone could easily compete with other high-end feature phones like the LG enV3, which is sold by Verizon Wireless or the Samsung Memoir T929, sold for T-Mobile USA's network. But even though these phones may have the features to compete, they're not sold through a wireless operator, which means that they are not subsidized, making them too expensive for most mainstream customers. The N97's suggested retail price is 700, and Sony plans to start selling the W995a for 600. Meanwhile AT&T charges 99 for the 8GB iPhone 3G, 199 for the 16GB iPhone 3GS, and 299 for the 32GB iPhone 3GS. In exchange for the subsidy, AT&T requires that customers sign a two-year service contract. The price of the service, which includes voice and data services, is a minimum of 70 per month. But regardless of whether a device is subsidized, users will have to purchase some kind of voice and/or data plan, depending on the type of device they buy. \\"In the U.S. market, price is a huge factor in determining which phones people buy,\\" said Will Stofego, an analyst with the market research firm IDC. \\"Why pay 500 or more for a phone when you can get an iPhone for 100? Of course you have to agree to the two-year service plan, but I think that's a trade-off most consumers are OK with.\\" Up until recently, unlocked phones--handsets that can be used on multiple carrier networks--were only available in \\"gray\\" markets where Americans bought phones from overseas. Now manufacturers are selling them on their Web sites, in their own retail stores, and through some big retail chains, such as Best Buy. Nokia has opened several retail stores in the U.S. And Sony Ericsson sells unlocked phones through Sony Electronic retail channels. As part of their push to address the U.S. market, Nokia and Sony Ericsson are also making sure that the phones they sell in the U.S. operate in the frequency bands used by AT&T and T-Mobile, the two main GSM carriers in the U.S. While these operators have built GSM networks just like carriers in Europe and parts of Asia, not all GSM networks operate on the same frequency, which means that some unlocked GSM phones bought in Europe or Asia won't work in the U.S. on a GSM network. Another benefit to buying a U.S.-friendly unlocked phone is that Sony Ericsson is now offering warranties for customers who buy their U.S. unlocked phones through a Sony retail channel. The company doesn't offer a warranty for phones designed for other countries and brought to the U.S. through the gray market. Roadblocks for unlocked phones Despite these efforts to create a stronger retail presence for these unlocked phones, the market remains small. In the U.S., only about 5 percent of the phones sold each year are unlocked and available from somewhere other than a carrier. This differs greatly from other markets. Worldwide, unlocked phones account for about 50 percent of phones sold. In Asia, about 80 percent of cell phones are sold independently of a carrier. And in Europe, roughly 70 percent of cell phones are sold unlocked. There are several reasons for this difference. For one, two of the four big nationwide U.S. cell phone operators in the U.S. use CDMA, which does not use SIM cards that can be interchanged between phones. Most of the world's cell phone carriers use GSM, which does allow for SIM cards. And because people buy unlocked phones in order to swap out SIM cards to use on other carrier networks, phones made by manufacturers such as Nokia and Sony Ericsson, which have concentrated efforts on developing GSM phones, can only be used on two of the big four nationwide wireless networks in the U.S.: AT&T and T-Mobile. But the biggest reason that unlocked phones haven't taken off in the U.S. is that they are much more expensive to buy than locked phones that are subsidized and typically require a two-year service contract. That said, Nokia and Sony Ericsson see opportunity in the U.S. market. And the consumers they're targeting are unlikely to be buying their first smartphone. Steve Medina, product and business manager for Sony Ericsson unlocked phones, says that unlocked phones in the U.S. appeal to a very niche market of tech-savvy consumers. \\"Unlocked phones aren't for every consumer,\\" he said. \\"They are really for the phone junkies; the geeks. It might seem crazy to some people that someone would drop 600 or 700 on a phone. But you'd be surprised at how many actually do.\\" Medina said a lot of the people buying unlocked phones either frequently travel internationally, or they have lived in Europe and Asia where people typically buy unlocked phones at full retail price. For these consumers, Medina says the benefits of an unlocked phone far outweigh the hefty price tag. The biggest benefit of an unlocked phone is that users can simply pop in SIM card to get service. And unlike GSM phones bought through U.S. operators, these phones don't require a special unlock code to be able to swap SIM cards. Medina says that's an important distinction, because when wireless subscribers from AT&T and T-Mobile unlock their phones, the locking software is still on the phone. The code that is used to unlock the device simply overrides that software. What this means is that when phones are updated, they can be relocked, forcing consumers to once again override the lock code. Another big benefit of buying an unlocked phone is that all the features that the manufacturer has included on the phone will work. U.S. cell phone carriers sometimes disable some functionality on phones that they sell. And with many phones, they often integrate their own software and branding onto the phone. But as Medina points out, unlocked phones are not for everyone. Aside from the cost, unlocked phones are often more difficult to set up. Users must configure their messaging functions and Internet functionality on their phones. Phones sold through carriers are already pre-configured for these functions. And when a carrier upgrades its network and sends out an automated update to phones on the network, unlocked users must handle the updates on their own. And if there is ever a problem with the phone or the service, an AT&T or T-Mobile service representative may not be able to help because he or she isn't trained to deal with these specific phones. While Sony Ericsson's Medina acknowledges that it's unlikely that the unlocked market will grow with respect to the overall cell phone market in the U.S. right now, he believes that eventually more U.S. consumers will buy unlocked phones. \\"We believe that at some point, the U.S. market will become more like the European and Asian markets where unlocked phones are the norm,\\" he said. \\"The U.S. wireless market will eventually evolve from a carrier-led market to one that is more open. And consumers will select a phone and then select a carrier.\\" But as long as mobile phone carriers continue to subsidize handsets, most consumers will opt for a subsidized phone rather than paying for a non-subsidized phone. \\"The problem in the U.S. is that people have been trained to buy on price,\\" Stofega said. Government intervention looming? But not all hope is lost for Sony Ericsson and Nokia in their quest to crack open the unlocked cell phone market in the U.S. These companies may get a little help from the government. Congress and the Federal Communications Commission are already investigating exclusive deals made between wireless carriers and handset makers. And some officials are even questioning the carrier practice of disabling certain features. It's difficult to say if either the FCC or Congress will actually do something to limit this practice, which could help open up the unlocked market. While a move like this would certainly increase choice for consumers, it could also drive up costs for consumers. Given this consequences and the fact that the phone companies have a strong lobbying organization in Washington, it seems unlikely that government intervention will happen any time soon. That said, the government has imposed unpopular rules on the phone companies previously. For example, wireless phone companies are now required to allow consumers to take their phone numbers with them when they switch carriers, which was a move that was initially highly unpopular with carriers. The best solution for cracking the unlocked phone market is for phone manufacturers to develop new business models that will keep consumer costs low, but still reward carriers and phone manufacturers. Medina suggests that Sony Ericsson could subsidize the cost of its phones by charging for mobile games and applications. This is a model that has worked well in the game console market. And there are already indications that consumers are hungry for mobile applications. The success of Apple's App Store is proof of that. But again price is a big factor in the success of such a plan. Through the App Store, consumers are already being conditioned to get applications for free or for 99 cents. \\"Right now unlocked phones will likely not appeal to the mainstream market,\\" Sony Ericsson's Medina admits. \\"Whenever you have a subsidized model, it is always going to be cheaper to buy a subsidized product. But there are different ways to address this, and we think right now we have a strong offering for hard core cell phone enthusiasts, who want the flexibility of an unlocked phone. But we are also looking at other revenue streams to subsidize unlocked phones.\\" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

In 1841, Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a violinist, living with his wife and two children in Saratoga Springs, New York. Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a slave pen run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \\"Platt\\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. However, tension grows between Northup and plantation carpenter John Tibeats which ends with Northup savagely beating and whipping Tibeats. Tibeats and his group try to hang Northup. Although they are not successful, Northup is left on the noose for hours before he is finally cut down.

Process: - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are fewer regulations restricting humans from starting campfires in forested areas happens, how will it affect fewer animals die from smoke inhalation. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case can be defined as the effect of fewer regulations restricting humans from starting campfires in forested areas. We will investigate whether this supposed perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the process, with a specific focus on the potential for fewer animals to die from smoke inhalation. As fewer regulations are put in place to prevent humans from starting campfires in forested areas, it can reasonably be assumed that the number of campfires, and therefore the risk of forest fires, may significantly increase. Forest fires, particularly those that are caused by human activity, can have a wide-ranging impact on the environment, including damage to the habitats of various animal species. Consequentially, an increase in forest fires, either in frequency or severity, can lead to a higher number of animals being affected, including an increased likelihood of death from smoke inhalation. One direct effect of the increase in forest fires caused by lax regulations on campfires is an increase in the number of trees and plants that are burned during these events. This destruction of vegetation not only contributes to the loss of natural habitats for many animal species but also leads to the loss of food sources, both for herbivores that rely on plant life and carnivores that feed on other animals in the ecosystem. In turn, this can force animals to venture further away from their natural habitats in search of food, placing them in direct danger of fires as they traverse these areas or increase their risk of encountering other dangers such as predators or loss of cover from hazards. Another indirect effect of the increase in forest fires due to fewer regulations on campfires can be seen in the loss of shelter and protection for animals living within these environments. The rapid spread of fires through thick forest can lead to the widespread damage or destruction of nests, dens, burrows, and other forms of shelter - many of which may not be easily relocated or reconstructed. This loss of shelter can leave animals more susceptible to predation, disease, and environmental hazards, further increasing their likelihood of death from smoke inhalation and other causes. Moreover, animals may experience heightened stress levels due to the increased frequency and severity of fires, as well as the loss of their natural habitats. Such stress can impact their overall health, making them more susceptible to various illnesses, thus indirectly increasing the chances of dying from smoke inhalation or other issues related to forest fires. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of fewer regulations restricting humans from starting campfires in forested areas potentially has both direct and indirect effects on the process. Primarily, it can lead to an increase in forest fires, through the destruction of habitats, food sources, and shelter for animals. This increases the likelihood of animals dying from smoke inhalation and other related causes. Furthermore, the stress associated with the increased frequency of forest fires due to lax regulations and the loss of natural habitats can weaken animals' health and susceptibility to diseases, further endangering their survival. Overall, this perturbation is expected to have a negative impact on the survival of animals within affected ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Psychotherapy is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change and overcome problems in desired ways. Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health, to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, and to improve relationships and social skills. Certain psychotherapies are considered evidence-based for treating some diagnosed mental disorders. - The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three partsthe outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word \\"ear\\" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Health is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living organism. In humans it is the ability of individuals or communities to adapt and self-manage when facing physical, mental or social changes. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in its 1948 constitution as \\"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\\" This definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value, the ambiguity in developing cohesive health strategies, and because of the problem created by use of the word \\"complete\\". Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction. - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. - A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. - Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon. Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines with variations in the use of logic, analytics, and experience to determine \\"cause and effect\\". In systems engineering and computer science, it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions. - A medical device is any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, material, or other articlewhether used alone or in combination, including the software intended by its manufacturer to be used specifically for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes and necessary for its proper applicationintended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of: - Surgery (from the \\"cheirourgik\\" (composed of , \\"hand\\", and , \\"work\\"), via , meaning \\"hand work\\") is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). - In medicine , a nebulizer or nebuliser ( see spelling differences ) is a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs . Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis , asthma , COPD and other respiratory diseases .

Question: Process: - Aluminium cans are put into a recycling bin - Aluminium cans are then collected and taken to a treatment plant - At the treatment plant the aluminium is sorted and cleaned - Readied for reprocessing - The aluminum cans go through a re-melt process - Turned into molten aluminium - The molten aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills and are rolled out into thin sheets - The rolls are ready to be made into new aluminum products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rollers in the plant stop working happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of the rollers in the plant stopping working does have an effect on the process of aluminum can recycling, both directly and indirectly. The rollers play a critical role in transforming the aluminum ingots into thin sheets, which are then used to create new aluminum products, including cans. If the rollers stop working, it causes a disruption in this vital step of the recycling process, leading to a series of consequences that ultimately impact the rate of aluminum can recycling and production. The direct effect of this perturbation is that the aluminum ingots can no longer be rolled into thin sheets at the plant. This means the ingots cannot be further processed into usable forms, leading to a bottleneck in the recycling process. Consequently, there will be a delay or temporary halt in the production of new aluminum products, including cans. Additionally, the inability to process the ingots into thin sheets could cause a buildup of raw materials at the mills. If the problem persists, there may not be enough storage space for these materials, leading to inefficiencies in the recycling process. The treatment plants would also be affected, as they would have to hold onto their processed aluminum rather than sending it to the mills for further production. In turn, this could reduce the overall efficiency and capacity of the recycling industry, leading to less aluminum cans being recycled over time. Furthermore, the indirect impact of this perturbation might also affect the entire supply chain, from can manufacturers to end consumers. The lack of readily available aluminum sheets could lead to shortages and delays in the production of new aluminum products, which may result in increased costs for manufacturers and higher consumer prices. This could potentially discourage consumers from using and recycling aluminum cans, thereby reducing the overall demand for aluminum recycling services. In conclusion, the perturbation of rollers stopping working at the recycling plant has both direct and indirect effects on the process of recycling aluminum cans. This disruption can result in a bottleneck in the recycling system, causing inefficiencies and negatively impacting the entire supply chain. If not addressed promptly, the situation can lead to a decline in aluminum can recycling and associated environmental benefits. It is vital that recycling plants maintain and monitor their equipment to mitigate the risk of disruptions, ensuring a smooth and efficient process for recycling and producing aluminum products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. Known for sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, and elaborate stage shows, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over thirty years. The youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame. After signing a recording contract with A&M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third studio album Control (1986). Context: Jackson began recording her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., in 2005. She recorded with producers Dupri, Jam and Lewis for several months during the following year. The album's title was a reference to the two decades since the release of her breakthrough album Control, representing the album's \\"celebration of the joyful liberation and history-making musical style.\\" To promote the album, Jackson appeared in various magazines, and performed on the Today Show and Billboard Awards. Jackson's Us Weekly cover, revealing her slim figure after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine's best-selling issue in history. 20 Y.O. was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri. Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying \\"If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison.\\" Jackson's airplay and music channel blacklist remained persistent, massively affecting her chart performance and exposure. However, lead single \\"Call on Me\\", which featured rapper Nelly, peaked at number twenty-five on the Hot 100, number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number six in the United Kingdom. The video for the album's second single, \\"So Excited\\", was directed by Joseph Kahn and portrayed Jackson's clothes disappearing through a complex dance routine. 20 Y.O. was certified platinum by the RIAA and sold 1.2 million worldwide, also receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album. After the album's release, Dupri was condemned for his production and misguidance of the album, and subsequently was removed from his position at Virgin Records. Slant Magazine stated, \\"After promising a return to Janet's dance-pop origins, [Dupri] opted to aim for urban audiences, a colossal mistake that cost Dupri his job and, probably, Janet her deal with Virgin.\\" Jackson was ranked the seventh richest woman in the entertainment industry by Forbes, having amassed a fortune of over 150 million. In 2007, she starred opposite Tyler Perry as a psychotherapist in the film Why Did I Get Married?. It became her third consecutive film to open at number one at the box office, grossing 60 million in total.

There is no question why their pizza wins Best of Las Vegas nearly every year. Having said that, the family and I went to try the newest edition located in the northwest off the 95 between the 215 exit and Durango. The experience was less than stellar overall. The ambiance and the appearance of the new Metro is wonderful. It is very open and inviting, and the seating is well spaced. The decor is great, with a mix of old-world Italy and sports banners hanging in the bar area. After being seated, we were greeted in a fairly good amount of time (within about 5 minutes) and the server started out on point. That is where the point became a jagged line. After our drink orders were in, we asked for a kid's cup for our son, and never saw it (after asking two additional times for it). The lack of attention continued for us throughout the meal. I did run to the restroom to verify that I was, in fact, still visible to the human eye just in case there was an anomaly, but alas I was not transparent. The orders were finally taken and the food did arrive to the table in a more than reasonable timeframe. The food is still exceptional, and even though this is a new location the quality is still very much the same as I would expect from Metro. The service, on the other hand, continued to deteriorate at an alarming rate. After receiving our food. We did not see our server again until nearly 20 minutes later. We had to ask another server for a refill of our beverages, and there was never a follow-up from our server until that 20 minute mark. When she did finally show up, my wife asked for to-go containers and a slice of their carrot cake for our son. The boxes did show up, but we never saw the carrot cake, or even the check for that matter! 20 more minutes passed and the server was seen checking on other tables and completely ignored us. This was the final straw. We called the manager over to express our frustration and concern over the missing cake that our son was now asking every 3 seconds for (never keep a 5-year-old away from his dessert). The manager was very courteous and did state that he had noticed the poor service (which is the first concern I have. If he is aware of the poor service, why wasn't he out there to begin with?) and wanted to make sure that we were taken care of. This was a very disappointing trip and one that I will have to think hard about returning to this location for. This restaurant's only saving grace is the food is fantastic and well worth a normal wait. I hope that they are able to correct their poor service issues.

Write an article based on this \\"A council's education service has been strongly criticised by watchdogs.\\"","completion":"Title: Watchdogs Criticize Council's Education Service - What Went Wrong and What Needs to Change Introduction A recent investigation conducted by independent watchdogs has revealed that a local council's education service has been met with strong criticism, shedding light on significant shortcomings in the system. Various factors, including inadequate resources, inefficiency in management, and poor communication channels, have contributed to the critique. The council under scrutiny must now urgently address these serious issues in order to improve the quality of education and fulfill its responsibility to the community. The Role of Watchdogs in Safeguarding Education Standards Independent watchdogs play a critical role in ensuring that education services maintain stringent standards of quality and efficiency. These entities scrutinize the functioning of councils, schools, and other institutions to detect deficiencies in their systems, enabling corrective action to be taken. In this instance, the council's poor performance in education has been brought to light by the diligent work of these watchdogs. Inadequate Resources and Its Impact on Education One of the primary concerns raised by the watchdogs in their critique of the council's education service is the severe lack of resources. Funding shortages create a detrimental chain reaction that impairs the overall learning experience for students. For instance, insufficient funds result in a dearth of teaching supplies, outdated materials, and inadequate technology, hindering the students' ability to learn effectively. Moreover, poorly maintained facilities reflect poorly on a council's capacity to foster a safe and conducive learning environment. Neglected repairs and outdated infrastructures pose potential dangers to both students and staff, consequently leading to a decrease in motivation and engagement. To address this issue, the council must seek ways to increase funding, enabling the necessary improvements to be made. Inefficiency in Management As highlighted by the watchdogs, the council's education service has also been plagued by issues in management. An ineffective top-down approach, characterized by weak or inconsistent decision-making, can have a considerable impact on the education system as a whole. Poorly managed services tend to suffer from high staff turnover, unclear objectives, and minimal accountability. To resolve such a crisis in management, the council must reassess its strategies and foster a culture of transparency and collaboration among stakeholders in the education system. In addition, establishing clear lines of communication and introducing performance metrics can encourage an atmosphere of accountability and responsibility. Communication Breakdowns within the Council's Education Service Watchdogs have identified that communication breakdowns within the council's education service have contributed to the subpar performance of the system. Poor communication channels among school administrators, teachers, and parents can cause confusion, missed opportunities, and mismanagement of resources. Moreover, the lack of effective communication between the council and the education service staff can result in delays or inconsistencies in implementing crucial policies. In order to rectify these communication problems, the council must ensure that regular meetings are held to facilitate open discussions and address concerns. Furthermore, creating online platforms for sharing information and updates can greatly improve communication and foster collaboration among staff members and the wider community. Conclusion The strong criticism put forth by watchdogs of the council's education service emphasizes the immediate need for systemic reform. Addressing inadequate resources, inefficiencies in management, and communication breakdowns, will not only improve the quality of education but also fortify the council's commitment to enhancing the overall well-being of the community. As we entrust our future generations' education to the council, it is crucial that they heed the recommendations provided by the watchdogs and prioritize long-term, sustainable solutions for the betterment of their education service."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What will happen with the narrator and free sample ?","completion":"In the given situation, the narrator seems to have encountered a product demonstration for grapes on special at the produce department taking place in their workplace. The person responsible for this demonstration is a chatty individual, preparing and giving out samples of a Weight Watchers (WW) strawberry mousse, accompanied by a couple of grapes. The narrator also shows their concern regarding the use of dairy and aspartame in the preparation of the mousse. As for the possible outcomes involving the narrator and the free samples, we can consider the following scenarios: 1. The narrator chooses to avoid the free sample due to their concerns about dairy and aspartame. In this case, they will continue with their work at the flower display, perhaps observing or interacting with the chatty person, but not indulging in the free samples being offered. The narrator might consider the potential health concerns or dietary restrictions that prevent them from trying the freebie and decide that it is not worth the risk. 2. The narrator decides to try the free sample despite their reservations. They might do this out of curiosity, to be polite, or maybe even because they get along well with the chatty person. After consuming the sample, the narrator could have various reactions, such as enjoying the taste but still being concerned about the ingredients, experiencing an adverse reaction due to their intolerance or sensitivity to dairy or aspartame, or realizing that their concerns were unfounded and the free sample was harmless to them. 3. The narrator might engage in a conversation with the chatty person, questioning the use of dairy and aspartame in the mousse. This interaction might lead to an educational moment, where the chatty person explains the reasons behind the choices or suggests alternative products that might be more suitable for the narrator's dietary preferences. This could lead to a more informed decision on whether or not to try the free sample, or it might encourage the narrator to look for other similar products that cater to their particular dietary needs. In summary, the outcome for the narrator and the free sample will highly depend on their personal preferences, priorities, and inclinations when it comes to trying out the food. The narrator's concerns and reactions can influence their decision and the overall experience with the product demonstration. Regardless of the chosen scenario, this situation highlights the importance of being aware of and understanding the ingredients and potential allergens in food, especially for those with dietary restrictions or preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Induction heating is the process of heating an electrically conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, through heat generated in the object by eddy currents (also called Foucault currents). An induction heater consists of an electromagnet, and an electronic oscillator that passes a high-frequency alternating current (AC) through the electromagnet. The rapidly alternating magnetic field penetrates the object, generating electric currents inside the conductor called eddy currents. The eddy currents flowing through the resistance of the material heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials like iron, heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses. The frequency of current used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth. - Thermionic emission is the thermally induced flow of charge carriers from a surface or over a potential-energy barrier. This occurs because the thermal energy given to the carrier overcomes the work function of the material. The charge carriers can be electrons or ions, and in older literature are sometimes referred to as \\"thermions\\". After emission, a charge that is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the total charge emitted is initially left behind in the emitting region. But if the emitter is connected to a battery, the charge left behind is neutralized by charge supplied by the battery as the emitted charge carriers move away from the emitter, and finally the emitter will be in the same state as it was before emission. - An oven is a thermally insulated chamber used for the heating, baking or drying of a substance, and most commonly used for cooking. Kilns and furnaces are special-purpose ovens, used in pottery and metalworking, respectively. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - An electric arc or arc discharge is an electrical breakdown of a gas that produces an ongoing electrical discharge. The current through a normally nonconductive medium such as air produces a plasma; the plasma may produce visible light. An arc discharge is characterized by a lower voltage than a glow discharge, and it relies on thermionic emission of electrons from the electrodes supporting the arc. An archaic term is voltaic arc, as used in the phrase \\"voltaic arc lamp\\". - Combustion or burning is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as smoke. Combustion in a fire produces a flame, and the heat produced can make combustion self-sustaining. Combustion is often a complicated sequence of elementary radical reactions. Solid fuels, such as wood, first undergo endothermic pyrolysis to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies the heat required to produce more of them. Combustion is often hot enough that light in the form of either glowing or a flame is produced. A simple example can be seen in the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen into water vapor, a reaction commonly used to fuel rocket engines. This reaction releases 242 kJ/mol of heat and reduces the enthalpy accordingly (at constant temperature and pressure): - A glow discharge is a plasma formed by the passage of electric current through a low-pressure gas. It is created by applying a voltage between two metal electrodes in a glass tube containing gas. When the voltage exceeds a certain value called the striking voltage, the gas in the tube ionizes, becoming a plasma, and begins conducting electricity, causing it to glow with a colored light. The color depends on the gas used. Glow discharge is widely used as a source of light in devices such as neon lights, fluorescent lamps, and plasma-screen televisions. Analyzing the light produced by spectroscopy can reveal much about the atomic interactions in the gas, so glow discharge is used in plasma physics and analytical chemistry. It is also used in the surface treatment technique called sputtering. - Electrical breakdown or dielectric breakdown is a long reduction in the resistance of an electrical insulator when the voltage applied across it exceeds the breakdown voltage. This results in the insulator becoming electrically conductive. Electrical breakdown may be a momentary event (as in an electrostatic discharge), or may lead to a discontinuous arc charge if protective devices fail to interrupt the current in a low power circuit. - A furnace is a device used for high-temperature heating. The name derives from Greek word \\"fornax\\", which means oven. The heat energy to fuel a furnace may be supplied directly by fuel combustion, by electricity such as the electric arc furnace, or through induction heating in induction furnaces. - An electric arc furnace ( EAF ) is a furnace that heats charged material by means of an electric arc . Industrial arc furnaces range in size from small units of approximately one ton capacity ( used in foundries for producing cast iron products ) up to about 400 ton units used for secondary steelmaking . Arc furnaces used in research laboratories and by dentists may have a capacity of only a few dozen grams . Industrial electric arc furnace temperatures can be up to 1,800 ° C ( 3,272 ° F ) , while laboratory units can exceed 3,000 ° C ( 5,432 ° F ) . Arc furnaces differ from induction furnaces in that the charge material is directly exposed to an electric arc , and the current in the furnace terminals passes through the charged material . - An induction furnace is an electrical furnace in which the heat is applied by induction heating of metal. Induction furnace capacities range from less than one kilogram to one hundred tonnes capacity and are used to melt iron and steel, copper, aluminium and precious metals. - An arc lamp or arc light is a lamp that produces light by an electric arc (also called a voltaic arc). The carbon arc light, which consists of an arc between carbon electrodes in air, invented by Humphry Davy in the first decade of the 1800s, was the first practical electric light. It was widely used starting in the 1870s for street and large building lighting until it was superseded by the incandescent light in the early 20th century. It continued in use in more specialized applications where a high intensity point light source was needed, such as searchlights and movie projectors until after World War II. The carbon arc lamp is now obsolete for all of these purposes and is only still made for very specialized purposes where a high intensity UV source is needed.

Title: Danny, the Champion of the World Movie plot: It is 1955, somewhere in rural England. Wealthy Victor Hazell owns a vast estate, and drives his expensive car proudly around it to survey his domain. He drives past several signs that show he has acquired much of his property recently, by buying out surrounding smallholdings. There are hundreds of prime pheasants wandering around his property, and as he drives along his two gamekeepers, Rabbetts and Springer, wish him a good morning. However, he does not acknowledge their presence, throws his cigar out the window and drives on proudly, much to their disgust.Hazell's good mood is ruined when he stops on a hillside and spots, in the distance, the garage and filling station owned by William Smith and his nine-year-old son, Danny. Hazell gets out of his car and peers at the structure through a set of field glasses, watching Danny fill the tank of a customer's car. In high bad humor, he returns to his own car and proceeds down the hill towards the filling station.In the garage, William and Danny have just finished repairing a car another customer left behind. Danny asks permission to drive it out of the garage, and William lets him do so. Hazell's car comes barreling down the hill at the same time as Danny is backing the car out of the garage, and both he and Hazell are forced to slam brakes to avoid a collision. William praises Danny for his quick thinking and Hazell, putting on a friendly tone, does the same. He then asks William if he'd be willing to sell his land - the Smiths own six acres of field and the garage, filling station, and an old caravan which serves as their home - but William tells him he already explained to the solicitor from Hazell's estate he was not interested.Hazell explains to William that his land is smack in the middle of the rest of his estate, and is preventing him from achieving his goal of having one of the biggest and best pheasant shoots in that part of England.

Hurricane Michael formed off the coast of Cuba carrying major Category 4 landfall in the Florida Panhandle. Surge in the Big Bend area, along... (Associated Press) PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Michael's battering waves swamped streets and docks and shrieking winds splintered trees and rooftops. The most powerful hurricane on record to hit Florida's Panhandle left wide destruction and at least one person dead and wasn't nearly finished Thursday as it crossed Georgia toward the Carolinas, still reeling from epic flooding in Hurricane Florence. Authorities said at least one person has died, a man killed by a tree falling on a Panhandle home. Search and rescue crews were expected to escalate efforts to reach hardest-hit areas and check for anyone trapped or injured in the storm debris. A day after the supercharged storm crashed ashore amid white sand beaches, fishing towns and military bases, Michael was no longer a Category 4 monster packing 155 mph (250 kph) winds. Downgraded to a tropical storm early Thursday over south-central Georgia, it continued to weaken but was still menacing the Southeast with heavy rains, blustery winds and possible spinoff tornadoes. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the eye of Michael was about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south-southwest of Macon in central Georgia at 12:00 a.m. Thursday. The storm had top sustained winds of 70 mph (112 kph) and was moving to the northeast at 17 mph (27 kph). After daylight Thursday residents of north Florida would just be beginning to take stock of the enormity of the disaster. Damage in Panama City near where Michael came ashore Wednesday afternoon was so extensive that broken and uprooted trees and downed power lines lay nearly everywhere. Roofs were peeled away, sent airborne, and homes were split open by fallen trees. Twisted street signs lay on the ground. Palm trees whipped wildly in the winds. More than 380,000 homes and businesses were without power at the height of the storm. Vance Beu, 29, was staying with his mother at her home, Spring Gate Apartments, a complex of single-story wood frame buildings where they piled up mattresses around themselves for protection. A pine tree punched a hole in their roof and his ears even popped when the barometric pressure went lower. The roar of the winds, he said, sounded like a jet engine. \\"It was terrifying, honestly. There was a lot of noise. We thought the windows were going to break at any time,\\" Beu said. Sally Crown rode out Michael on the Florida Panhandle thinking at first that the worst damage was the many trees downed in her yard. But after the storm passed, she emerged to check on the cafe she manages and discovered a scene of breathtaking destruction. \\"It's absolutely horrendous. Catastrophic,\\" Crown said. \\"There's flooding. Boats on the highway. A house on the highway. Houses that have been there forever are just shattered.\\" A Panhandle man was killed by a tree that toppled on a home, Gadsden County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anglie Hightower said. But she added emergency crews trying to reach the home were hampered by downed trees and debris blocking roadways. The debris was a problem in many coastal communities and still hundreds of thousands of people were also left without power. Gov. Rick Scott announced afterward that thousands of law enforcement officers, utility crews and search and rescue teams would now go into recovery mode. He said \\"aggressive\\" search and rescue efforts would get underway. \\"Hurricane Michael cannot break Florida,\\" Scott vowed. Michael sprang quickly from a weekend tropical depression, going from a Category 2 on Tuesday to a Category 4 by the time it came ashore. It forced more than 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast to evacuate as it gained strength quickly while crossing the eastern Gulf of Mexico toward north Florida. It moved so fast that people didn't' have much time to prepare, and emergency authorities lamented that many ignored the warnings and seemed to think they could ride it out. In Panama City, plywood and metal flew off the front of a Holiday Inn Express. Part of the awning fell and shattered the glass front door of the hotel, and the rest of the awning wound up on vehicles parked below it. \\"Oh my God, what are we seeing?\\" said evacuee Rachel Franklin, her mouth hanging open. Based on its internal barometric pressure, Michael was the third most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland, behind the unnamed Labor Day storm of 1935 and Camille in 1969. Based on wind speed, it was the fourth-strongest, behind the Labor Day storm (184 mph, or 296 kph), Camille and Andrew in 1992. It also brought the dangers of a life-threatening storm surge. In Mexico Beach, population 1,000, the storm shattered homes, leaving floating piles of lumber. The lead-gray water was so high that roofs were about all that could be seen of many homes. Hours earlier, meteorologists watched satellite imagery in complete awe as the storm intensified. \\"We are in new territory,\\" National Hurricane Center Meteorologist Dennis Feltgen wrote on Facebook. \\"The historical record, going back to 1851, finds no Category 4 hurricane ever hitting the Florida panhandle.\\" The storm is likely to fire up the debate over global warming. Scientists say global warming is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme weather, such as storms, droughts, floods and fires. But without extensive study, they cannot directly link a single weather event to the changing climate. After Michael left the Panhandle late Wednesday, Kaylee O'Brien was crying as she sorted through the remains of the apartment she shared with three roommates at Whispering Pines apartments, where the smell of broken pine trees was thick in the air. Four pine trees had crashed through the roof of her apartment, nearly hitting two people. Her biggest worry: finding her missing 1-year-old Siamese cat, Molly. \\"We haven't seen her since the tree hit the den. She's my baby,\\" a distraught O'Brien said, her face wet with tears. ___ Associated Press writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida; Terry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Freida Frisaro in Miami; Brendan Farrington in St. Marks, Florida; Russ Bynum in Keaton Beach, Florida; Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, North Carolina; and Seth Borenstein in Kensington, Maryland, contributed to this story. ___ For the latest on Hurricane Michael, visit https://www.apnews.com/tag/Hurricanes ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida One of the strongest storms in recorded history to hit the US has battered north-west Florida, flooding homes, washing out beaches and snapping trees. Rescue services are beginning to assess the full impact of Hurricane Michael, which made landfall on Wednesday afternoon as a category four storm with 155mph (250km/h) winds. At least six people have been killed, most of them in Florida. Having weakened to a tropical storm, Michael has been hitting the Carolinas.

Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \\"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

Many trees fell, roofs flew off houses, and lots of things broke. At least six people died because of the storm. After hitting Florida, it weakened and moved to other places like Georgia and the Carolinas, but it still brought heavy rains and strong winds.

Sandstorms usually happen in spring. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from the north of China. In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns into sand. When spring comes and the ice melts, the ground becomes loose. Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Besides, in northeast China, there is some vast desert. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe in too much sand, they will cough or have serious illnesses. Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never come back home. The winds also tear the farmers' houses down. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's a piece of advice. Ask your parents to help you plant some trees in spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them. Question: Which of the following is NOT a way to stop sandstorms? Options: A: Plant more trees in spring. B: Stop people to cut down too many trees C: Don't stay outside when sandstorms happen. D: Tell people about the dangers of sandstorms. A:","completion":"C: Don't stay outside when sandstorms happen. This option is not a way to stop sandstorms; it is a safety measure during a sandstorm. The other options, such as planting more trees, stopping people from cutting down too many trees, and informing people about the dangers of sandstorms, are all actions to help prevent or mitigate sandstorms in the long term. By contrast, staying indoors does not contribute to the prevention or mitigation of sandstorms but simply keeps individuals safe during an ongoing sandstorm."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO Act, took effect, the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups, which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns. All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations, using the provisions provided in the RICO Act. Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided contains information about the Philippines, its language, its connection with Arabic, a Filipino dish called Batchoy, the presence of an ethnic group known as Chinese Filipino in the country, and the country itself. First, let's explore the Philippines. The Philippines is a Southeast Asian country located in the Western Pacific Ocean, comprised of more than 7,000 islands. The country has a diverse culture, with influences from Chinese, Spanish, American, and indigenous groups. This unique blend of cultures can be observed in various aspects of the Philippines, such as cuisine, clothing, religion, and language. The official languages spoken in the country are Filipino, which is based on Tagalog, and English. Arabic, another language mentioned in the provided data, is primarily spoken in the Middle East and North Africa. Although it is not an official language in the Philippines, it is used to a certain extent within the Filipino Muslim communities, specifically in the southern parts of the nation. Arabic plays a crucial role among the Muslim majority in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), as religious texts and communication within the community frequently use this language. Next, we have Batchoy, a well-known Filipino dish that originated from the Visayas region in the central part of the country. It is a flavorful soup that typically consists of pork, beef, or chicken, miki or egg noodles, crushed pork cracklings, vegetables, and garlic. Often served in a steaming hot bowl, Batchoy is famous for its rich, savory broth that blends various ingredients and flavors, making it a popular comfort food among Filipinos. Regarding the Chinese Filipino ethnic group, it is a significant part of the diverse population in the Philippines. As descendants of Chinese immigrants, these individuals have integrated themselves into the larger Filipino society for centuries. Many of them initially arrived as traders, and their influence can still be seen today in numerous aspects of local life. For instance, Filipino cuisine has adopted several Chinese dishes, such as lumpia (spring rolls) and pancit (noodles). In addition, Chinese Filipino families have played essential roles in the growth of the Philippine economy, establishing business empires that span various industries. In summary, the data provided offers a glimpse into the diverse and multifaceted aspects of the Philippines as a nation. It highlights the linguistic connection with Arabic, particularly among the Muslim Filipino communities, the popular Filipino dish Batchoy, the Chinese Filipino ethnic group, and the country itself with its rich, vibrant culture. These different components intertwine seamlessly and contribute to the Philippines' unique character that distinguishes it from other nations in the region and around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It also helps to make notes in pencil in the margin in your own words to summarize or comment on important points. Effective study techniques are essential for academic success and personal growth. These techniques not only help to improve understanding and retention of knowledge, but also foster critical thinking skills and the ability to consistently produce high-quality work. One such technique is making notes in pencil in the margins of textbooks and other study materials. This method allows for flexibility and organization, while also being gentle on the material being used. Here is a detailed explanation of how to effectively use this technique: 1. Choose the right pencil: Select a pencil that is comfortable to hold and provides a clear and legible line. Ideally, use a pencil with a good eraser, so you can easily modify your notes later if necessary. 2. Read and understand: Before you begin writing notes, it's crucial to read and comprehend the material thoroughly. As you read, identify the key points and arguments presented in the text. 3. Marginal notes: When you come across an important point, argument, or piece of evidence in the text, write a concise summary or comment in your own words in the margin. By putting the information in your own words, you are actively engaging with the material, which can lead to better understanding and retention. 4. Highlight key terms and concepts: If you encounter new terms or crucial concepts, underline or circle them in the text and, if necessary, write a brief definition or explanation in the margin. This will help you quickly locate important information while reviewing your notes later. 5. Use abbreviations and symbols: To save time and space when writing your marginal notes, develop a system of abbreviations and symbols that you can consistently and clearly use. For example, use \\"+\\" for \\"and,\\" \\"=>\\" for \\"implies,\\" and \\"E.g.\\" for \\"for example.\\" 6. Connect ideas: If you notice connections between ideas or concepts within the text, draw lines or arrows linking the related marginal notes. This visual representation can help you see the bigger picture and understand how various points relate to one another. 7. Review and revise: Periodically revisit your marginal notes to reinforce your understanding and retention of the material. Use this opportunity to refine your notes and fill in any gaps in your understanding. 8. Use your marginal notes for further study: When studying for exams or working on assignments, refer to your marginal notes to quickly and easily recall important information and arguments from the text. This will save you time and effort, allowing you to focus on the critical aspects of your work. By implementing this technique, you can significantly enhance your study process. Making notes in pencil in the margin in your own words will help you actively engage with the material, resulting in a deeper understanding and improved retention of knowledge. Moreover, marginal notes serve as a convenient and organized reference tool that can boost your efficiency and success in your academic endeavors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paraphrasing is the act of rephrasing or rewording a statement while still retaining its original meaning.

Let's break down the components of both sentences to better illustrate this: 1. Sentence 1: - Subject - Arlington County Washington Boulevard - Action - replaced - Object - the line between Bluemont Junction Trail and Bluemont Junction 2. Sentence 2: - Subject - The Bluemont Junction Trail in Arlington County - Action - replaced - Object - the line between Washington Boulevard and Bluemont Junction Both sentences discuss that a replacement has occurred, and they both mention Arlington County, Washington Boulevard, Bluemont Junction Trail, and Bluemont Junction. The primary differences lie in the sentence structure, word order, and the specific focus of each sentence. In Sentence 1, the focus is on the \\"Arlington County Washington Boulevard.\\" This is the primary subject performing the action of \\"replacing.\\" The object being replaced is the line between Bluemont Junction Trail and Bluemont Junction. In contrast, the focus of Sentence 2 is the \\"Bluemont Junction Trail in Arlington County,\\" which is the subject performing the same action of \\"replacing.\\" The object undergoing replacement is now the line between Washington Boulevard and Bluemont Junction.

To further matters, the local minister turns the sermon at an Easter mass from the passion and resurrection of Christ to matters of Sodom and Gomorrah at the very sight of McClain and his mother entering the church to join in the ceremony. In the dojo's defense, they turn young McClain away not directly because of his sexual orientation, but because they fear losing their students over the matter. In fact, the family that runs the dojo has had some acceptance issues of their own to deal with, not just because of being Asian, but actually because of being multi-ethnic, with Irish, Asian, and even Filipino members and relatives. They're also of mixed faiths, with the grandparents devout Buddhists and one of their sons a Christian actively involved with the local church. The family has a very proud tradition of teaching the martial arts throughout the generations, a tradition that sadly is not open to the women of the family, as we learn when we are introduced to Karen O'Neil (played by the film's director D.

Peter Hall directed the Bayreuth Ring after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.

What is the answer to this question? the classic greek model of the agora was?","completion":"The classic Greek model of the Agora was a central public space that served as the heart of social, political, and economic life in ancient Greek city-states. It played a crucial role in the development of democracy and the Greek way of life during the Classical period (5th-4th centuries BCE). This open square or marketplace was typically located near the center of a town and was surrounded by numerous important civic buildings, temples, and monuments, reflecting the multi-functional nature of ancient Greek society. In the classic Greek model of the Agora, several essential elements and characteristics contributed to its importance: 1. Administrative and public buildings: The Athenian Agora, one of the most well-known examples, was bordered by government buildings such as the Bouleuterion (council house) and the Prytaneion (town hall). These were the sites where the city's council and assembly met to make decisions that affected the entire population. 2. Judicial function: The Agora often housed law courts where citizens could seek justice and trials were conducted. In ancient Athens, the Heliaia was the largest law court, where jurors were chosen to deliberate on cases. 3. Commercial activities: The Agora was a center for buying and selling goods and services. Merchants, artisans, and farmers would gather to offer their products in small shops or stalls. Some Agoras featured porticoes, like the Stoa of Attalos in Athens, where people could browse through enclosed rows of shops. 4. Social interactions and cultural events: It was a prominent gathering place for citizens to discuss and debate social and political issues or to exchange information and news. Public speeches, dramatic performances, and musical events were often held in the Agora, contributing to the vibrant cultural life of ancient Greek cities. 5. Religious sites: Temples and sanctuaries dotted the landscape of the Agora. One famous example is the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, which overlooked the square. These sacred spaces were important for religious activities and celebrations. 6. Monuments and statues: The Agora also served as a place to honor notable citizens, famous events, or the city's patron deities with various statues, dedications, and monuments. These artistic displays and memorials helped reinforce collective memory and shared values among the population. 7. Education and philosophy: Figures like Socrates and Plato frequented the Agora in Athens, engaging citizens in philosophical dialogues and teaching students. Public spaces like these were crucial in fostering the intellectual growth and exchange of ideas that characterized ancient Greek society. In summary, the classic Greek model of the Agora was a multi-purpose public space that facilitated a wide range of activities. It was the hub of political, social, economic, religious, and cultural life in ancient Greek cities and significantly influenced the development of democratic institutions and practices. The Agora's many functions and elements have left a lasting legacy not only in the field of archaeology but also in modern urban planning and design."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, freezing slows food decay and the growth of micro-organisms, making it an effective method for food preservation. Lower temperatures contribute to slower reaction rates and limit bacterial growth due to reduced water availability. In the situation presented, Robert the baker has two temperature options for freezing his cupcakes: 0° F and 10° F. Since lower temperatures slow reaction rates and bacterial growth more effectively, storing the cupcakes at 0° F will result in slower decay compared to storing them at 10° F.

The Earth's magnetic field, which protects the planet from solar radiation, has grown weaker over the past six months, according to satellite data. This map shows the filed from January to June. Shades of red represent areas of strengthening, while blues show areas of weakening over the 6-month period","completion":". Scientists are currently investigating the potential causes and long-term implications of this weakening magnetic field. Despite the concerning data, experts reassure that this decline is not a definitive sign of an impending catastrophic event, such as a geomagnetic reversal. The Earth's magnetic field has displayed fluctuations throughout its history, and periods of weakening have occurred even in the absence of any known reversals. Researchers are now focused on studying the behavior of the magnetic field in order to better understand the processes occurring within the Earth's core, which generate the magnetic field. Developing a comprehensive understanding of these processes will enable scientists to make more accurate predictions about the future evolution of the magnetic field, and to potentially mitigate any potential risks associated with its fluctuations. In the meantime, governments and organizations around the world are encouraged to monitor and prepare for any potential consequences of a weaker magnetic field. As our reliance on technology and infrastructure susceptible to space weather events continues to grow, better understanding and predicting the Earth's magnetic field will help ensure the resilience and safety of our society in the face of this natural phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo Reuters VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will makes saints of two of the three Portuguese shepherd children believed to have seen a vision of the Madonna 100 years ago at Fatima, the Vatican said on Thursday. The pope, who is due to visit Fatima in May for the 100th anniversary of the reported apparitions, approved decrees recognizing miracles attributed to the intercession of Francisco Marto and his sister Jacinta Marto. They died while they were still children several years after the visions. The third visionary, Lucia Dos Santos, became a nun and died in 2005 at the age of 97. Francisco and Jacinta Marto were beatified - the last step before sainthood - by Pope John Paul in 2000. The Catholic Church posthumously confers sainthood on people considered so holy during their lives that they are now believed to be with God and can intercede with him to perform miracles. Miracles are usually the medically inexplicable healing of someone. The Church believes that the Madonna gave the children three messages, the so-called three secrets of Fatima. The first two were revealed soon and concerned a vision of hell, the prediction of the outbreak of World War Two, a warning that Russia would \\"spread her errors\\" in the world, and the need for general conversion to God and the need for prayer. The \\"third secret\\" intrigued the world for more than three-quarters of a century, inspiring books and cults convinced that it predicted the end of the world. In 2000, the Vatican said the third secret was a prediction of the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul on May 13, the same day of the first reported apparition in 1917. The Vatican did not say when the sainthood ceremony of Jacinta and Francisco Marto would take place but Church sources said it was likely to be held during the pope's visit in May. (Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Alison Williams) ||||| ROME — Pope Francis on Thursday officially recognized a miracle attributed to the intercession of a young brother and sister who said, 100 years ago, that the Virgin Mary had appeared to them in the Portuguese village of Fátima. The approval of the miracle was the final step needed before the siblings, Jacinta and Francisco Marto, could be made saints. By signing the decree, the pope increased the likelihood that he could canonize the two when he visits the Fátima shrine in May, 100 years to the day that the children said that a vision of Mary had appeared to them for the first time. Officially, no date has been set for the canonization ceremony. The Marto children and their cousin Lucia de Jesus dos Santos said they had seen the apparitions six times between May 13, 1917, and Oct. 13, 1917, when Jacinta was 7, Francisco was 9 and Lucia was 10. By the time of the last apparition — in 1917 — 50,000 to 70,000 people had gathered to pray with the children, according to the website of the Shrine of Fátima. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Pope Francis is set to make saints of two of the three Portuguese shepherd children who claimed to have seen a vision of the Madonna 100 years ago in Fatima.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If more phase changes were to occur in the process of cell division, it could potentially affect the process of replication. The perturbation could lead to disruptions or alterations in the proper progression of the cell cycle phases, which might result in errors in DNA replication, chromosome segregation, or cytokinesis. The supposed perturbation could have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effects might include changes in the behavior of specific proteins or enzymatic activities involved in DNA replication or chromosome segregation. These changes, in turn, could lead to misaligned or improperly separated chromosomes, which might eventually result in cell death or the development of abnormal cells. Indirect effects could arise from changes in the regulatory mechanisms that control the progression of the cell cycle. Perturbations in the fine balance of activators and inhibitors that control the cell cycle could result in uncontrolled cell division, leading to the formation of cancerous or abnormally functioning cells. Alternatively, disruptions in the proper timing of cell cycle events might result in delays or premature completion of specific phases, which could negatively impact the cell's ability to replicate its DNA accurately. In any case, a perturbation affecting the multiple phases of the cell cycle would likely have consequences for the process of replication, potentially leading to errors in DNA replication, complications in chromosome segregation, or other disruptions in the proper functioning of the cell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Previously, a judge had ruled that a claim made in the biography of Polish-Jewish singer Wiera Gran that Szpilman had been a member of the Jewish police in the Warsaw ghetto during WWII was protected by freedom of speech—despite testimony to the contrary by survivors, as well as biographer Agata Tuszynska being dubious about Gran's claim, the AFP reports. With this new decision, Tuszynska and her publisher have 15 days to make a public apology to Szpilman's son and widow and cut the offending material from future editions of Vera Gran: The Accused. Of the decision, per the Guardian, Szpilman's son says it will \\"allow ethical standards in Poland to Improve.\\" But Tuszynska tells a local newspaper that she is \\"really sorry\\" about the ruling, adding, \\"Once again, they have closed Wiera Gran's mouth.\\" Gran herself was accused of being a Nazi collaborator, according to reports. Although she was eventually cleared, continuing criticism prompted her to leave Poland in 1950. Szpilman, who died in 2000, was portrayed by Adrien Brody in The Pianist, notes Time.

The claim was initially made in the biography of Polish-Jewish singer Wiera Gran that Szpilman was a member of the Jewish police in the Warsaw ghetto during WWII. A judge had previously ruled that this claim was protected under freedom of speech but the testimonies of survivors and the biographer's doubts about Gran's claim were not taken into account. Now, the court has decided that the claim was indeed defamatory, and the biographer Agata Tuszynska and her publisher are required to make a public apology to Szpilman's son and widow, as well as remove the offending material from future editions of Vera Gran: The Accused. This ruling is seen as a victory for truth and ethical standards in Poland, according to Szpilman's son. However, Tuszynska expressed disappointment about the ruling, claiming that it silenced Wiera Gran, who herself was accused of being a Nazi collaborator. Despite being cleared of the charges, she faced constant criticism and left Poland in 1950.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The roots of Simple Minds are in the short-lived punk band Johnny & The Self-Abusers, founded on the South Side of Glasgow in early 1977. The band was conceived by would-be Glasgow scene-maker Alan Cairnduff, although he left the job of organising the band to his friend John Milarky. At Cairnduff's suggestion, Milarky teamed up with two musicians he had never worked with before - budding singer and lyricist Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill. Kerr and Burchill had known each other since the age of eight. After joining Johnny & The Self-Abusers, they brought in two of their school friends, Brian McGee on drums and Tony Donald on bass (all four had previously played together in the schoolboy band Biba-Rom!). With Milarky established as singer, guitarist and saxophonist, the line-up was completed by his friend Allan McNeill as third guitarist. Kerr and Burchill also doubled on keyboards and violin respectively. In common with the early punk bands, various members took on stage names--Milarky became \\"Johnnie Plague\\", Kerr became \\"Pripton Weird\\", MacNeil chose \\"Sid Syphilis\\" and Burchill chose \\"Charlie Argue\\". Johnny & The Self-Abusers played their first gig on Easter Monday, 11 April 1977, at the Doune Castle pub in Glasgow. The band played support to rising punk stars Generation X in Edinburgh two weeks later. The band went on to play a summer of concerts in Glasgow. The band soon split into two factions, with Milarky and McNeil on one side and Kerr, Donald, Burchill and McGee on the other: at the same time, Milarky's compositions were being edged out in favour of those of Kerr and Burchill. In November 1977, Johnny & The Self-Abusers released its only single, \\"Saints and Sinners\\", on Chiswick Records (which was dismissed as being \\"rank and file\\" in a Melody Maker review). The band split on the same day that the single was released, with Milarky and McNeil going on to form The Cuban Heels. Ditching the stage names and the overt punkiness, the remaining members continued together as Simple Minds (naming themselves after a David Bowie lyric from his song \\"Jean Genie\\"). The next record, Sparkle in the Rain, was produced by Steve Lillywhite and released in February 1984. It gave rise to successful singles like \\"Waterfront\\" (which hit No. 1 in a few European countries) and \\"Speed Your Love to Me\\" and \\"Up on the Catwalk\\". Sparkle in the Rain topped the charts in the UK and hit the Top 20 in several other countries (including Canada, where it reached No. 13). In 1984, Jim Kerr married Chrissie Hynde from the Pretenders (who renamed herself Christine Kerr). Simple Minds did a North American tour where they played as headliners supported by China Crisis during the Canadian leg and in support of the Pretenders in the US while Hynde was pregnant with Kerr's daughter. The marriage lasted until 1990. Despite the band's new-found popularity in the UK, Europe, Canada and Australia, Simple Minds remained essentially unknown in the US. The band's UK releases on Arista were not picked up by Arista USA who had 'right of first refusal' for their releases. The 1985 film The Breakfast Club broke Simple Minds into the US market, when the band achieved their only No. 1 U.S. pop hit in April 1985 with the film's closing track, \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\". The song was written by Keith Forsey and Steve Schiff; Forsey offered the song to Billy Idol and Bryan Ferry before Simple Minds agreed to record it. The song soon became a chart-topper in many other countries around the world. At around this point, the camaraderie that had fuelled Simple Minds began to unravel, and over the next ten years the band's line-up underwent frequent changes. Jim Kerr subsequently recalled \\"We were knackered. We were desensitized. The band started to fracture. We were lads who had grown up together, we were meant to grow together, politically, spiritually and artistically. But we were getting tired with each other. There was an element of the chore creeping in. We were coasting and this whole other thing was a challenge.\\" The first casualty was bassist Derek Forbes, who was beginning to squabble with Kerr. Forbes began failing to turn up for rehearsals, and was dismissed. Forbes remained in touch with the band (and soon reunited with another former Simple Minds bandmate, drummer Brian McGee, in Propaganda). Forbes was replaced by former Brand X bass player John Giblin (who owned the band's rehearsal space and was a session musician who had worked with Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush). Giblin made his debut with Simple Minds at Live Aid in Philadelphia, where the band performed \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\", a new track called \\"Ghost Dancing\\" and \\"Promised You a Miracle\\". Simple Minds were the first band to be approached to play the Philadelphia leg of Live Aid. Simple Minds returned to activity later in 1994. By now the band was officially a duo of Kerr and Burchill (with the latter taking on keyboards in the studio, as well as guitar). Hiring Keith Forsey (the writer of \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\") as producer, they began to put together an album which returned to the uplifting arena rock feel of their Once Upon a Time days. With Gaynor now out of the picture, the remaining instrumentation was covered by session musicians (although Malcolm Foster was included among the bass players used for recording). Good News from the Next World was released in 1995. The album reached No. 2 in the UK and produced the two Top 20 hits \\"She's a River\\" and \\"Hypnotised\\". The band toured to promote Good News from the Next World, with Malcolm Foster and Mark Taylor as touring bass and keyboard players and Mark Schulman (who had played on the album) on drums. This was Foster's last work with the band, and Schulman returned to session work at the end of the tour. After being released from their contract with Virgin Records, Simple Minds made use of the skills of their original rhythm section, Derek Forbes and Brian McGee (returning after respective eleven- and fourteen-year absences). Although McGee was not involved beyond the rehearsal stage, Forbes formally rejoined Simple Minds in July 1996. The band then reunited with Mel Gaynor for a studio session in early 1997. Gaynor was reinstated as a full-time member for the European tour (which once again featured Mark Taylor on keyboards). After the tour, album recording sessions were interrupted by Kerr and Burchill's decision to play live (without Forbes, Taylor or Gaynor) as part of the Proms tour (a series of orchestral concerts featuring a mixture of light classical and pop music). The duo played versions of \\"Alive And Kicking\\", \\"Belfast Child\\" and \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" backed by a full orchestra and were billed as Simple Minds.

The necklaces were given to Samantha and not Rachel because","completion":"they held magnificently and unusually large Amethysts with intricate designs etched into them. These were no ordinary pieces of jewelry, but magical amulets passed down through generations in Samantha's bloodline. The legacy was that they would only reflect their true power and splendor in the hands of the women born into the family. Rachel, though close as a sister to Samantha, was not the rightful recipient of the necklaces. For Rachel was Samantha's best friend, close as kin, but not by blood. She was orphaned as a child and taken in by Samantha's family. Samantha's parents treated her and loved her as if she was their own. But despite the love they bore for both girls, the unwavering tradition dictated that the necklaces could only be given to the direct descendants in the family. And now, on Samantha's 20th birthday, the day marked by tradition for the transfer of the amulets took place. Samantha's mother handed them over with a warming embrace, her eyes glossy with unshed tears. \\"These were your grandmother's, and her mother's before her, and now they are yours,\\" she said, a tremor in her voice. Through generations, the amulets had been symbols of womanhood and wisdom – an emblem of their family's legacy. However, the decision wasn't without its consequences. An air of melancholy surrounded Rachel; an emotion rising from being left out of a momentous family ritual, rather than materialistic envy. It wasn't the amulets' material value that stirred Rachel's sadness, but the symbolic bond it reinforced between Samantha and her bloodline, highlighting her own lack of connection to her unknown ancestry. To ease Rachel's discomfort, Samantha suggested that they share this tradition together, promising that although Rachel wouldn't be its actual bearer, they could discover its mysteries together. After all, they had tackled every other aspect of their lives together, why should this be different? Samantha's eyes danced to the rhythm of excitement. \\"I bet there is a lot we can explore, there are legends of these amulets containing secrets, powers, adventurous tales,\\" Samantha pondered, a dreamy look in her eyes. Rachel's perennial spirit sparked at the thought of an adventure. It was always her spirit that fought the restlessness of reality – the thirst of the unknown. The necklaces were perhaps given to Samantha to help her with her bloodline's tradition, but Samantha and Rachel would take this tradition further, making it their own. They would uncover the mysteries of the amulets together, and in doing so, they would continue to reinforce their bond – a bond that was stronger than any blood relationship could ever be. Time would show these necklaces were not meant to create a divide, but instead act as a force to bring the girls even closer, embarking on a journey steeped in history, magic, and shared sisterhood."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

A: Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. Does the answer correctly answer the question Possible answers: (A). yes. (B). no.","completion":"A: European parties, particularly Spanish explorers, are responsible for releasing pigs in Bermuda. These pigs eventually became feral and widespread on the island before the European settlement began. Spanish explorers, who first discovered Bermuda in the early 16th century, likely released pigs as a source of future food and sustenance for any travelers in the area, though the exact details of their introduction may be lost to history. Feral pigs, also known as wild boars or razorbacks, descend from domesticated pigs that were either intentionally or accidentally released into the wild. Over time, these pigs have adapted to their environment, becoming more resilient and resourceful. In the case of Bermuda, the feral pig population grew rapidly in the absence of natural predators and with ample food available from the island's natural resources. In addition to the Spanish, other European explorers and settlers also contributed to the introduction of pigs to various regions across the globe. For example, in the United States, Hernando de Soto is known to have brought pigs with him on his 16th-century explorations, which would eventually lead to the establishment of feral pig populations in parts of the U.S. Feral pigs have had a significant impact on the environments they inhabit. In Bermuda, their foraging activities altered the island's ecosystem, affecting the distribution and abundance of native plant species. With the European settlement in Bermuda and the introduction of other domestic animals, the population of feral pigs was eventually brought under control, although their descendants can still be found in certain areas. In conclusion, European parties, initially led by Spanish explorers, are responsible for releasing pigs in Bermuda. These animals, which have become feral and abundant, have had significant ecological impacts on the island and remain a part of its natural history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him.

The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

Romance was released internationally on 19 November 1991, and sold over 400,000 copies in its first 10 days. In Mexico it was certified octuple platinum by the Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON) for shipping two million copies, the country's all-time third-bestselling album (only Juan Gabriel and José José has sold more copies with Recuerdos, Vol. II and 20 Triunfadoras respectively).

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (Available options: * negative; * positive;).","completion":"Sure, I will construct a negative review for an imaginary yet generic film to best illustrate how it would go step-by-step. Step 1: Start with the Movie Title and Overview Title: \\"Falling Echoes\\" \\"Falling Echoes\\" was anticipated to be a groundbreaking mystery thriller, but sadly, the film is a far cry from expectations. Step 2: Comment on the Movie's Plot. The plot, rather than being the mind-bending experience we were promised, came off as a chaotic, and poorly strung along attempt at suspense. It was filled with illogical twists and turns that instead of enhancing the storytelling, did quite the opposite, creating a forest of confusion and unbelievable scenarios. Step 3: Criticize Characters and Their Development The characters are as flat as they come, with no development or growth throughout the film. The protagonist is mysteriously unrelatable and distant, making it almost impossible for the audience to resonate or connect with him. Step 4: Discuss the Technical Aspects Despite having some visually appealing shots, the cinematography fails to compensate for the movie's narrative shortcomings. The editing was erratic, propelling the audience from one disjointed scene to another with no fluidity whatsoever. Step 5: Critique the Acting The acting, unfortunately, did nothing to salvage \\"Falling Echoes\\". The cast's performances felt forced and robotic, lacking in depth and emotive prowess, thereby further undermining the thin plot. Step 6: Provide an Overall Summary and Rating As much as I wanted to find a silver lining, \\"Falling Echoes\\" proved to be a massive letdown. The film's pitiful attempt at a convoluted plot combined with lackluster performances and forgettable characters make for a regrettable viewing experience.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What 1993 science fiction horror-themed first person shooter video game surpassed Corridor 7: Alien Invasion? Answer:","completion":"The 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter video game that surpassed Corridor 7: Alien Invasion in terms of popularity, influence, and impact in the gaming industry is Doom, developed and published by id Software. Doom was released on December 10, 1993, for the MS-DOS platform, and it quickly transformed the gaming landscape with its groundbreaking and innovative features. Doom's success can be attributed to a variety of factors that set it apart from its competitors, including Corridor 7: Alien Invasion. Some of the most important aspects that contributed to Doom's supremacy are: 1. Graphics and Technologies: Doom introduced revolutionary graphics and a pseudo-3D game engine called the id Tech 1 engine, also known as the Doom engine. This was a massive leap forward in video game graphics technologies, allowing for complex levels with varying heights, dynamic lighting, and the ability to use textures on all surfaces, which contributed to a more immersive and visually-appealing experience than Corridor 7: Alien Invasion. 2. Gameplay and Level Design: The gameplay in Doom was fast-paced, intense, and action-packed, offering a more engaging experience for players. With diverse and non-linear level design, players were encouraged to explore and locate secret areas, items, and weapons, ushering in a new era of replayability and discovery. On the other hand, Corridor 7: Alien Invasion featured a slower-paced gameplay style and more linear level design, which did not resonate with players as much as Doom's dynamic approach. 3. Weapons and Enemies: Doom provided players with a plethora of iconic and powerful weapons, like the shotgun, chaingun, and BFG 9000. This arsenal allowed players to respond to various enemy types and situations effectively. The game was also famous for its diverse and menacing roster of enemies, featuring various demons and monsters, each with unique attacks and behaviors. In comparison, although Corridor 7: Alien Invasion had a decent selection of weapons and enemies, it failed to match Doom's depth and variety in this regard. 4. Atmosphere and Sound Design: Doom's dark and oppressive atmosphere was created through the combination of its visuals, level design, and intense music and sound effects. The game effectively used lighting and texture work to immerse players in an unsettling and atmospheric experience. The effective use of sound, including memorable music scores by composer Bobby Prince, contributed to the game's dark, adrenaline-pumping aura. Corridor 7: Alien Invasion, while similarly dark in theme, did not manage to create the same level of immersion and atmospheric impact as Doom. 5. Modding and Customization: Doom had a profound impact on the modding community, as id Software released the game's source code and encouraged players to create custom content. This led to the birth of the WAD file format, which allowed users to create new levels and modifications. The result was an endless stream of additional content and creative ideas that extended Doom's life beyond its initial release and cemented its status as an iconic title. Corridor 7: Alien Invasion lacked such an extensive modding community, which negatively impacted its longevity in comparison to Doom. In conclusion, Doom surpassed Corridor 7: Alien Invasion in 1993 due to its groundbreaking technology, engaging gameplay, diverse weapon and enemy selection, immersive atmosphere, and its impact on the modding community. It is considered one of the most influential and essential video games in history for these reasons, while Corridor 7: Alien Invasion, although ambitious, failed to achieve a similar level of significance in the gaming world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The floor of the Everglades formed between 25 million and 2 million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present. Shorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod. Five types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as... Answer:","completion":"Lake Okeechobee. In the given article, it mentions that \\"Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil.\\" This indicates that Lake Okeechobee is the location in the area where nutrients quickly deteriorate.

Article: When you consider what subject to study in college, chances are that you and your parents will think about what you can make out of _ after graduation. You will likely ask the question: \\"Can I find a well-paid job or simply a job with a degree in this in the future?\\" This consideration also influences students when they come to choose between studying science or humanities at college. People generally believe that the humanities, which include literature , history, cultural studies and philosophy, do not prepare students for a specific vocation . Science subjects, however, are considered vocational courses that produce scientists, engineers and economists . \\"I've decided to take finance as my college major. My parents and I think this subject will help me get a good job or start a business,\\" said Huachen Yueru, 17, a science student at Wuxi No. 1 High School. Even those who choose a liberal arts education often pick the humanities subject which they think will best help them later find a job. \\"I'm going to study Spanish in college, which I believe will open doors to a high-paying job for me,\\" said Liu Chao, 18, a Senior 2 student at Dalian No 20 High School. He said few of his classmates show interest in subjects like philosophy and history, which are seen as \\"less promising\\" in job markets. The popularity of liberal arts subjects among college students has also been decreasing in the United States. American scholars and universities are concerned that in the ongoing economic crisis liberal arts subjects will be hit hardest. As money tightens , they worry that the humanities may become \\"a great luxury that many cannot afford\\", according to the New York Times. Question: What can we infer from the passage ? Options: A: Humanities are becoming less and less popular with the students. B: Studying science subjects is sure to find a well-paid job. C: The humanities in college should be cancelled. D: The writer thinks those who choose the liberal arts education will choose their favorite subjects.

Given the following context: As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him. answer the following question: What is the name of the person in whose foot was blood poisoning?","completion":"The name of the person in whose foot was blood poisoning is Harvey."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Scotland's Finance Minister John Swinney is meeting his Treasury counterpart Greg Hands in the hope of meeting the 23 February deadline. Both sides will be called to give evidence to Holyrood's devolution committee on that date. Mr Swinney and Mr Hands hope a deal can be struck this week. However, both men have said the onus is on the other to give some ground. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Swinney said he remained \\"committed to reaching an agreement that is in line with the principles of the Smith Commission\\". He said: \\"For both parliaments to have adequate time to scrutinise an agreement, it is important that we make progress.\\" No deal. No further devolution. Holyrood can't take on extra tax and welfare powers unless there's a fiscal framework to underpin them. Any framework will include a system to reduce the grant Holyrood gets from the Treasury, to reflect its growing ability to raise its own revenue. The two sides are struggling to agree the fairest way to achieve that. The Scottish government says the Treasury's current offer would leave it out of pocket. The Treasury disputes that and says SNP ministers can't expect taxpayers in the rest of the UK to underwrite all the risks that come with extra responsibilities. The Scotland Office minister, Lord Dunlop, says the UK government is \\"committed to go the extra mile to get a deal\\". But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she \\"will not sign up to a deal that's unfair to Scotland\\". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling for him to step in over the matter. He has said that \\"no one is keener\\" than he is to reach an agreement, but also warned the Scottish government would have to be ready to \\"move towards\\" his position. Despite months of talks, the deadline for agreement was pushed back earlier this month. On Wednesday, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson proposed a compromise that would see both sides give some ground to agree a shorter-term deal that would be reviewed in five years. Earlier this week, Mr Hands was criticised for being on holiday with his family while negotiations were taking place. A Treasury spokeswoman has said the UK government had shown it was willing to compromise and \\"go the extra mile\\" to secure an agreement. The two sides differ on key parts of the deal, in particular their interpretation of the \\"no detriment\\" principle called for by the Smith Commission on further powers for Scotland. This means neither the Scottish or UK budgets should be left worse off in future by the finalised agreement. The Scottish government claims the Treasury's latest offer would amount to an \\"almost Â£3bn cut\\", while Mr Hands insists an offer tabled by Mr Swinney is \\"not logical\\" and \\"not fair\\" to taxpayers across the rest of the UK. The deal proposed by Ms Davidson would see both parties give some ground. She wants the Scottish government to agree to the UK government's new method of calculating the amount of money it receives each year from the Treasury. In return, she wants the UK government to guarantee the devolved administration would not receive \\"a penny less\\" than it would under its preferred mechanism, effectively insuring Holyrood against any budget shortfall. This deal would then be reviewed in full after a five-year trial period.

That's right, it's time for those of us who live in open primary and caucus states—andin the next three weeks—to head out and cast a vote for Rick Santorum. Why would we do such a crazy thing? Lots of great reasons! Republican turnout has sucked, and appears to be getting worse by the contest. Unlike the 2008 Democratic primaries, which helped President Barack Obama and the Democrats to build a national organization, the GOP is an organizational disaster, with waning voter interest. That means that it takes fewer votes to have an impact than if Republican turnout was maxed out. Several of the contests have produced razor-thin margins of victory. Rick Santorum won Iowa by 34 votes, Mitt Romney \\"won\\" Maine by 194 votes. It won't take many of us to swing contests the way we want them to swing. The longer this GOP primary drags on, the better the numbers for Team Blue. Not only is President Barack Obama rising in comparison to the clowns in the GOP field, but GOP intensity is down—which would have repercussions all the way down the ballot. The longer this thing drags out, the more unpopular the Republican presidential pretenders become. Just look at Mitt Romney's trajectory, which followed Herman Cain's trajectory, and Newt Gingrich's trajectory, and Michelle Bachmann's trajectory, and so on. Rick Santorum will inevitably follow the same path once he gets properly vetted. Mitt Romney has been unable to stem the bleeding despite his tens of millions. Just imagine Santorum, with the far more radical record and a continued inability to raise real money. It's a no-brainer! The following states have completely open contests coming up: 2/28: Michigan (Primary) 3/6: North Dakota (caucus) 3/6: Tennessee (primary) 3/6: Vermont (primary) If you live in one of those states, pledge to participate in Operation Hilarity by voting or caucusing for Rick Santorum.

After young squire Sir Johan wins in a jousting tournament in his kingdom, his friend Peewit, the kingdom's court jester dwarf, celebrates by singing a victory song, with only one problem; he is so terrible a singer he drives the whole kingdom into hiding (not to mention attracting a powerful thunderstorm), and only Johan was kind enough to escort Peewit back to the castle in the rain.The next morning, a musical instrument merchant arrives in front of the castle to sell instruments to Peewit, but only the nameless King and Johann are present to meet him. After being offered some obnoxious instruments, Johan and the King angrily send off the merchant, who accidentally leaves behind one of the instruments offered - a peculiar flute with only 6 holes! When Peewit almost takes notice, Johann and the King sneak the flute off into the castle to destroy it before he can find it. They throw it in the King's fireplace, but the fire emanates green smoke that permeates the King's room! Peewit is among those who try to put the fire out, and much to the dismay of Johan and the King, he finds the flute in the ashes. But once Peewit cleans the flute and goes around the kingdom playing it, he is delighted to make a surprising discovery; once played, the flute causes anyone who hears it to dance uncontrollably and subsequently pass out from exhaustion. Just as Peewit is enjoying tormenting everyone with this newfound gift, the same merchant as before is offering instruments to the owner of a bar in town. When he is worried to notice (and mentions) that the odd 6-holed flute he had was missing, he is overheard by a shady bearded fat man named Matthew Oilycreep (AKA: Matthew McCreep), who makes inquiries about the flute to the merchant, who recalls that he dropped it at the front of the kingdom while offering it to Peewit.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On a plot of soil, nestled against the backdrop of skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, a group of residents are turning a lack of access to fresh produce into a revival of old traditions and self-empowerment. Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose. The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood. \\"It's a reawakening going on. It's almost like it's a renaissance,\\" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc. \\"There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa. Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward.

Going on a vacation is typically a time for relaxation, leisure, and enjoyment, allowing individuals to take a break from their daily routine, work, and other responsibilities. People embark on vacations to explore new places, experience different cultures, create unforgettable memories, and indulge in a variety of activities. One of the primary goals of a vacation is to have fun and create an enjoyable experience for everyone involved. Travelers often choose destinations that cater to their interests and preferences, whether it be lounging on beautiful beaches, engaging in adrenaline-inducing adventures, or exploring the culinary delights of a foreign country. While some people might experience brief moments of panic or debate during the planning process or due to unexpected circumstances, these feelings are not the primary focus of a vacation. Similarly, although vacations can sometimes lead to debt if not managed responsibly, it's not the primary intent for most people when they embark on a trip. In addition, people may also seek a sense of peace during their vacations, hoping to escape the stressors of daily life and find tranquility in their chosen destination. But, it is important to note that seeking peace in itself is often a part of the pursuit for having fun, as feeling serene and relaxed can undoubtedly make the experience more enjoyable.

Given these facts, what can cause sinkholes among the following options: - Solid bedrock - rivers - mines - Drought - Rain - Evaporation - coal - storms The answer is:","completion":"Sinkholes are formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks, like limestone, dolomite, and gypsum, due to the circulation of water through the underground bedrock. Among the options provided, the factors that can contribute to the formation of sinkholes are: 1. Rivers: Rivers can carry and move water through underground channels in soluble bedrock, causing the dissolution of rocks and leading to the formation of sinkholes over time. 2. Mines: Mining activity can cause the removal of support in the underground rock layers. As the support is lost, the overlying rock and soil can collapse, leading to the formation of sinkholes. 3. Rain: Rain, also known as precipitation, plays a significant role in the formation of sinkholes. Rainwater is slightly acidic due to the presence of carbon dioxide in the air. When it seeps into the ground, it dissolves soluble rocks, forming cavities and voids. Over time, these spaces can collapse, causing sinkholes to form on the surface. 4. Storms: Intense storms can lead to heavy rainfall, increasing the rate of dissolution of soluble bedrock. Additionally, stormwater runoff can cause erosion, which can contribute to the formation of sinkholes. Drought, evaporation, coal, and solid bedrock are not direct causes of sinkholes. Drought and evaporation can indirectly influence the process by affecting the availability of water needed to dissolve soluble rocks, but they do not cause sinkholes by themselves. Coal and solid bedrock do not contribute to the formation of sinkholes, as they are not soluble rock types that can be easily dissolved by water."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

CONTEXT: 11 de enero de 2006 Irán reinició su programa de investigación nuclear este martes (10), según anunció el Organismo Internacional de Energía Atómica (OIEA), añadiendo que \\"la investigación incluirá enriquecimiento de uranio a pequeña escala, utilizable en plantas de energía o en armas\\". \\"Hay una diferencia entre la investigación y la producción de combustible nuclear... la producción de combustible nuclear sigue suspendida\\", afirmó Mohammad Saeedi, de la Organización de Energía Atómica de Irán. Estados Unidos ha dicho que cualquier enriquecimiento de uranio es una \\"seria intensificación [del conflicto]\\". Un vocero de la Casa Blanca afirmó también que Irán se arriesga a una remisión al Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, organismo que puede imponer sanciones si continúa con su actual senda nuclear. Por su parte, el ministro británico de Asuntos Exteriores Jack Straw dijo que el conflicto con Irán debe resolverse por vías diplomáticas y que la \\"acción militar no está en nuestros planes\\". Mohamed ElBaradei, director del OIEA, les dijo a los 35 países que encabezan el organismo que \\"Irán tenía la intención de realizar un enriquecimiento de uranio limitado en sus instalaciones de Natanz, donde rompió los sellos de la ONU ante los inspectores del OIEA\\". \\"Irán planea instalar una cascada ultracentrífuga de gas a pequeña escala en su planta piloto de enriquecimiento de combustible en Natanz\\", dijo un diplomático occidental mientras leía el informe de ElBaradei. Los diplomáticos europeos habían dicho que convocarán una reunión de emergencia del OIEA para considerar la remisión de Teherán a la ONU para mayores acciones o sanciones. Los EUA dijeron que \\"esto ahora parece inevitable\\". Teherán niega querer la tecnología nuclear más que para programas civiles de energía a fin de satisfacer la \\"creciente\\" demanda de electricidad del país. Las potencias occidentales parecen hacer caso omiso de las afirmaciones iraníes y dicen que ese país \\"debe abstenerse de cualquier trabajo que pueda ayudar al desarrollo de armas atómicas\\". La Unión Europea dijo que la más reciente acción iraní \\"hace perder la confianza internacional en la naturaleza pacífica de su programa nuclear\\". En Berlín, el ministro de Exteriores alemán Frank-Walter Steinmeier advirtió que Irán había \\"cruzado un límite\\" al remover los sellos de sus plantas nucleares. El alto funcionario dijo que esperaba \\"que los iraníes sepan que pueden enfrentar consecuencias como resultado de su acción\\" y añadió que espera que Teherán vuelva al \\"camino de la razón\\". China también le pidió a Irán que prosiga el diálogo con el Reino Unido, Francia y Alemania. El vocero del ministro de exteriores chino Kong Quan declaró que \\"todas las partes deben mostrar moderación y hacer esfuerzos para construir la confianza mutua\\". La cadena iraní de noticias Khabar informó que el parlamento de ese país apoyó la decisión del presidente Mahmud Ahmadineyad de reiniciar el trabajo de investigación, calificándolo de \\"fuente de orgullo nacional\\".

Urged to loosen up by her friends, Kenya accepts a blind date with landscape architect Brian Kelly arranged by her co-worker Leah Cahan, who is in the process of planning the kind of wedding Kenya wants herself. The two meet at Starbucks, and she is surprised to discover Brian is white. She quickly excuses herself and leaves. The two unexpectedly meet again at a party at Leah's parents' home, where Brian landscaped the grounds. Impressed with his work, Kenya decides to hire him to renovate her unkempt backyard garden. As time passes, their employer-employee relationship evolves into a friendship and then love. Although Brian is helping her feel more comfortable about her living environment, Kenya finds it difficult to dismiss her reservations about their romance. The opinions of her girlfriends Cheryl, Nedra, and Suzette, her upper class parents Joyce and Edmond, and her womanizing younger brother Nelson begin to have a deleterious effect and Brian's unwillingness to discuss issues of color drives them apart.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: When I had trouble bending over to tie my shoes and I wasn’t pregnant. When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn. In the winter I can’t ride, swim, garden, or mow, and I hate exercise I don’t enjoy. Anyway the long answer to the defining moment but there it is just the same.

The context mentions that Saints John's church dome, which was decorated by Palonino, contains some of the best frescoes in Spain, which implies a considerable degree of artistic skill and recognition. Palonino's artistic contributions to this church have made it an important focal point in the region, and have immortalized his work as being among Spain's finest in the realm of frescoes. The information supplied illustrates the significance of various prominent architectural sites in the area: Parish churches, including Saints John (Baptist and Evangelist), the Knights Templar's El Templo, the former convent of the Dominicans, the Colegio del Corpus Christi, the Jesuit college, and the Colegio de San Juan. These religious and educational institutions signify the rich historical background and artwork that the region boasts. It is important to note that the art created by Palonino in Saints John's Church holds a particular prominence within the context mentioned. Frescoes, as a form of mural painting, involve applying pigments on wet plaster, allowing the art to become an integral part of the wall or ceiling. This technique, which requires exceptional skill and precision, suggests that Palonino was a master in his field. Consequently, his contributions to the church's dome substantially impacted the recognition and allure of the entire site. Although the context focuses primarily on the architectural settings, Palonino's fundamental role in shaping the artistic reputation of Saints John's Church should not be understated. His remarkable frescoes continue to draw people from around the world, contributing to Spain's unique blend of cultural heritage and artistic tradition and placing him at the forefront of those responsible for the art of the one best known for art in the specified context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How does the actress feel about the playwright?

Title: Golden Age of TV and Jazz Product review: From the first note, you know you're watching history in the making. Then, you realize that this is not a recorded theme song. It's actually the Cannonball Adderley Sextet playing behind the opening credits. Jazz Scene USA was a short-lived TV showcase of jazz. Filmed in black & white, the cameras work in sympathy with the players. Every nuance of the performance is captured down to the vibrations of the bass strings. Having been born in 1969 and having seen too much TV, it is my opinion that television's golden age has come and gone. For me the best shows (Twilight Zone, The Honeymooners, Star Trek, etc.) were made between 1952 and 1969. DVD is the perfect medium to revive these old shows. Now they need to reissue other, more recent music programs from TV like David Sandborn's \\"Night Music\\" (early 1990's) series and PBS' \\"Sessions On West 54th\\".

For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. and a hint : When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

She wanted to eat some icecream but ate candy instead, because her teeth can stand warm food like the","completion":"candy she picked up from her last visit to the confectionery shop. The shop, called Delights Galore, was known for its wide assortment of candy and sweets that made children and adults alike giddy with excitement. The shopkeepers claimed that they sourced these treats from every corner of the world, so there was always something new and delightful to discover. Candy, in all its various forms and flavors, was the perfect compromise for her sensitive teeth. Warm food was gentle on her teeth, whereas cold food would send a shiver down her spine due to the sharp pain that would radiate from her mouth. While the doctor's advice had been to take things slowly and to avoid cold food for awhile, she couldn't resist her desires. As she unwrapped the candy and popped it into her mouth, she closed her eyes and began to savor the taste. The candy started with a sweet crunch on the outside, quickly dissolving to reveal a gooey, fruity center. The flavors danced on her tongue, reminiscent of a tropical paradise she visited on her best vacation ever. That vacation was a dream come true; a month spent traveling the world and exploring every bit of it she could. From historic landmarks to exotic cuisine, she'd done it all. The memory of those sun-soaked days filled her with nostalgia, and the candy was a modest token of that trip. It allowed her a moment of escape from the humdrum life she led now. Though the candy was a delectable reminder of the adventure that stretched beneath the glittering sun, it was still no substitute for the ice cream she longed for. She remembered the subtle flavor varieties of ice cream churned out by the seaside ice cream parlors that filled the air with an intoxicating aroma. How she wished she could experience that again without fear of the cold-induced pain. Perhaps she could; she had an idea. Her friend Lucy once mentioned a recipe for homemade ice cream. But being the problem-solver that she was, she thought to herself, \\"what if I take that recipe and create something warm? Would that not bring a semblance of that beautiful moment back to life?” She spent hours researching, experimenting, and perfecting her recipe. In the end, she'd done it! Her creation – warm, velvety, and custard-like – was a testament to her creativity and passion. One spoonful was all it took to transport her back to the seaside, basking in the sun, with waves crashing on the shore. Her innovation did not go unnoticed. Friends, neighbors, and family members clamored to try the unique dessert that captured the essence of ice cream but met the approval of her sensitive teeth. Soon enough, word of her creation began to spread around town. Enthralled by her newfound culinary discovery, she decided to open a small cafe, offering her delicious warm ice cream alongside other traditional desserts. Although some skeptics were hesitant to try it at first, they soon realized that it was an experience to remember. This new creation garnered the attention of food enthusiasts and critics alike, bringing her a level of fame she had never imagined. The cafe, dubbed “Warm Whispers,” soon became a local favorite, and the young woman's once ordinary life blossomed into something extraordinary. She continued to innovate and try new things, never forgetting the roots of her inspiration, the teeth sensitivity that led her to this incredible journey. She helped revolutionize the dessert scene, proving that even with limitations, one can find creative ways to enjoy the things they love. In a way, she got to live her vacation over and over again, as she crafted desserts that were reminiscent of her travels. Now, children and adults alike can walk into her cafe, bask in the cozy atmosphere, and take a bite of that warm, inviting, and nostalgic taste that she had lovingly crafted. One woman's desire for ice cream turned into a creative alternative that was enjoyed by many. Through hard work, determination, and an unwavering passion, she turned her limitations into sweet opportunities that changed not only her life but also the lives of those who savored her creations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
