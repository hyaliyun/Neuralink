Here is a news article: TheWashingtonPost Limbaugh on Cain story: ‘Hit job’ journalism that was racially-motivated Rush Limbaugh weighed in Monday on the allegations that Herman Cain sexually harassed two former female employees, calling the piece by Politico a “hit job” based on racially-motivated stereotypes. “This is not a news story, this is gutter partisan politics, and it’s the politics of minority conservative personal destruction is what you’ve got here,” the conservative radio host said, also mentioning The Post’s story on Florida senator Marco Rubio (R). “We cannot have a black Republican running for the office of President. We can’t have one elected.” Limbaugh also said that Bill Clinton must be somewhere “laughing himself sick over this hit job from Politico...If this story were about Bill Clinton, the left would be circling the wagons.” Limbaugh said that Cain was targeted because of his conservative views and skin color. “Anything good that happens to any black or Hispanic in American politics can only happen via the Democrat Party. If it happens elsewhere, we’re going to destroy those people a la Clarence Thomas.” “It really is about blacks and Hispanics getting too uppity. That’s what this is,” he said. “You don’t achieve in American politics as a Republican.....you try it and we’re going to destroy you.” Thomas, who faced allegations of sexual harassment during his Senate confirmation hearing for the U.S. Supreme Court two decades ago, also used the same argument, saying that hearings amount to a “high tech lynching” of blacks who think for themselves. During her show, Laura Ingraham suggested occupying Politico’s Arlington offices, after a caller drew parallels between Cain and Thomas and said that “we need to stand up for this citizen candidate.” The occupy reference was to the Occupy Wall Street protests that have been rocking the political world lately. “You’re saying Occupy Politico in other words,” Ingraham said. “They’re occupying Wall Street, we need...OccupyPolitico.com....stop destroying a good man’s reputation....we have seen this movie before and we know how it ends.” Cain has repeatedly denied that anything inappropriate took place while he led the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. He has also said he had no knowledge of any financial settlement, reportedly to be in the five-figure range, according to Politico. Cain calls harassment accusations a ‘witch hunt’ Cain addresses his racial appeal Cain sings at press club The Fix: Who gains if Cain loses? ||||| By Jeff Poor, The Daily Caller Politico dropped a bombshell story Sunday evening, charging that GOP presidential front-runner Herman Cain was accused of sexual harassment by two unnamed females in the late 1990s when he was CEO of the National Restaurant Association.

Ask Allen West. Ask Michael Steele. Ask Clarence Thomas. And even what the allegations are here, I mean, just shows you how the civil-rights juggernaut has gone off the rails. The idea of civil rights laws to begin with ironically was to protect blacks from Democrats from the South who won’t protect them.

Is European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, the provided answer offers a good, although brief, introduction to scholae monasticae. However, a more detailed and long answer would be: Scholae monasticae were Christian monastic schools that emerged in Europe during the early Middle Ages, specifically around the 6th century. They played a crucial role in the development of education, contributing to the preservation and transmission of knowledge in a period marked by turmoil and decline of classical civilizations. Scholae monasticae were typically found in monasteries and cathedrals, where monks and nuns taught a variety of subjects focusing on religious education, Latin, and liberal arts. The main purpose of these monastic schools was to educate the clergy, as well as to cultivate and preserve the religious, cultural, and intellectual traditions of Christianity. Monastic education was grounded in the Benedictine Rule, a set of guidelines established by St. Benedict in the 6th century that emphasized the importance of daily work, prayer, and reading. As a result, monks and nuns were expected to be literate, contributing to the development of a scholarly community within these monastic institutions. Scholae monasticae taught the seven liberal arts, which were divided into two categories: the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). Moreover, they often studied texts from classical Greek and Roman authors, along with Christian literature such as the Bible and the Church Fathers' works. This synthesis of religious and secular learning allowed the monastic schools to become centers of intellectual life and knowledge preservation during the Early Middle Ages. Despite being primarily intended for the education of the clergy, many scholae monasticae also admitted laypeople, providing an opportunity for broader access to education. Throughout the years, these monastic schools evolved and expanded, eventually giving rise to more secular institutions like medieval universities. The emergence of universities as independent centers of learning marked a critical turning point in European higher education, gradually shifting focus from exclusively religious instruction to a more diverse range of disciplines. Nonetheless, scholae monasticae continued to exist alongside universities, contributing to the overall development and advancement of European education. In summary, scholae monasticae were Christian monastic schools that played an important role in the preservation and transmission of knowledge during the early Middle Ages. They offered education to the clergy and, in some cases, laypeople, teaching both secular and religious subjects. These forerunners of the later European universities helped shape the landscape of higher education and contributed to the intellectual and cultural development of Western society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please briefly summarize this news article: US-trained Syrian rebels refuse to fight ​al-Qaida group after kidnappings A group of Syrian rebels that includes fighters trained by the United States have declared their refusal to fight al-Qaida’s affiliate in the country, the Nusra Front, following a series of kidnappings by the militant group. A source in Division 30, which has endured a campaign of kidnappings by the Nusra Front, said they also oppose the American air strikes carried out in the last few days against the al-Qaida-linked fighters. The statements complicate the American strategy in Syria, which has suffered a string of setbacks and delays, deploying just over 50 fighters dedicated to fighting the terror group Islamic State in the year since its programme to train and equip rebels began. “With all the immense military power the US has at its disposal, the start to the mission is nothing short of an embarrassment and if it has any hope of succeeding, it needs to show results fast,” said Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and an expert on Syrian insurgent groups. The Nusra Front launched a campaign of kidnappings and attacks against Division 30 shortly after the arrival of the first contingent of 50 to 60 US-trained fighters from Turkey, accusing the group of seeking to spread American influence. The Qaida affiliate, whose fighters have pledged allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, kidnapped Division 30’s overall commander last week along with six others as they planned an offensive against Isis positions in northern Aleppo. Nusra then attacked Division 30’s headquarters, killing five fighters and wounding 18 others, as the US-backed rebel group appealed for peace. The American-led coalition that has been assembled to fight Isis bombed Nusra positions in Syria in apparent retaliation. The US had previously targeted a Nusra-affiliated faction known as the Khorasan Group, which the Americans say is planning attacks against the west from inside Syria. Nusra’s leader has denied the group exists. Nusra’s campaign against the US-backed rebel unit continued this week, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring network with wide contacts inside Syria, saying Nusra kidnapped five more members of Division 30. A source in the US-backed group said those captured were actually families of the fighters. It is unclear how many of the rebels actually trained by the US have been incapacitated in the campaign, with conflicting reports from activists and the rebel group itself, which says only one of its US-trained fighters has “disappeared”. In a new statement after the latest spate of kidnappings, Division 30 pledged never to fight Nusra and said it was focused on fighting Isis and the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Related: Syria approaching de facto partition amid Assad military setbacks “Division 30 was formed by the honorable sons of Syria to free their nation from Assad’s gangs and Daesh [Isis],” the statement said. “Division 30 pledges before the Syrian people to commit to the principles under which it was formed and to not be dragged into any side battle with any faction, and that it has not fought and will not fight the Nusra Front or any other faction regardless of name or ideology.” A source in Division 30 told the Guardian the group still has members training with the US and that they opposed American airstrikes against Nusra. “We have nothing to do with the coalition strikes, that is the truth and we are opposed to strikes against the Nusra Front’s facilities to this day,” the source said. “Our goal is clear – Daesh followed by the regime.” The latest declarations raise questions about the ability of the US to influence the rebels it has trained on the ground, and the viability of such an effort within Syria’s complex web of insurgent politics and alliances, where Isis and Nusra have emerged as two of the most powerful groups fighting on the ground. “The group almost certainly does not believe some of the things it has said lately, including protesting at US strikes on Nusra, but you can hardly blame them for such attempts at rescuing their credibility on the ground,” said Lister. “It’s quite telling in fact that a majority of the mainstream opposition now views Division 30 and the train and equip mission with intense suspicion – not only for the lack of regime focus, but for the disastrous start the 54 fighters have had.”","completion":"A group of Syrian rebels trained by the US have declared their refusal to fight against the Nusra Front, Al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria, after a series of kidnappings by the militant group.

A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: This passage is mainly about _ .

Solve -12*x + 111 = 99 for x.","completion":"To find the solution for the equation -12*x + 111 = 99 for x, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable (x). First, we want to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation to isolate x. To do this, we'll subtract 111 from both sides of the equation. -12*x + 111 - 111 = 99 - 111 This simplifies to: -12*x = -12 Step 2: Solve for x. Now, we want to solve for x by eliminating the coefficient -12 in front of the x term. We can achieve this by dividing both sides of the equation by -12. (-12*x) / -12 = -12 / -12 This simplifies to: x = 1 So, the solution to the equation -12*x + 111 = 99 for x is x = 1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The club have sold all 7,500 tickets for the match and Flynn believes his players can conclude their miraculous recovery. \\"I've been calm this week. We were dead and buried when I took over,\\" he said. Newport are bidding to retain their Football League status after four seasons in League Two, having waited 25-years to return to League Two after the club went out of business in 1989. A period where they could not even find a home in Newport followed, leading to a spell playing in Gloucester, where County earned their 'Exiles' nickname.

The history of the Czech language can be traced back to its Old Czech variant, which was spoken in the Great Moravian Empire during the 10th century. The language evolved throughout the centuries, influenced by neighboring tongues, historical events, and cultural shifts. The Czech language has a rich literary tradition, with notable works dating back to the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Baroque, and subsequently throughout various periods of European history. Czech authors and poets, such as Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, and Jaroslav Seifert, have made significant contributions to world literature. The Czech language has several dialects that can be divided into two primary types: Bohemian and Moravian. The Bohemian dialects are spoken in the western and central parts of the Czech Republic, while the Moravian dialects are spoken in the eastern and southern parts of the country.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.

If the chair does not adequately support your lower back, you can place a small pillow at the small of your back to increase support. Make sure your chair fits you. Try out a floor model before buying. Your arms, remember, should form an angle between 90 and 120 degrees, and your forearm should be approximately level with the ground. Your desk should also have a rounded (rather than a flat) front edge. The rounded edge will minimize pressure on your wrist and hand. If your keyboard and mouse are far away from you, you’ll have to lean across the desk to access them, disrupting your proper posture. Use a keyboard tray if you have limited desk space, or if your chair or desk prevent you from placing your keyboard at a comfortable height. A good keyboard will be inclined away from you slightly, with the top row of keys at a slightly lower elevation than the space bar and bottom-most row of keys. Keyboards that do not meet these design specifications might inspire you to lean back in your seat or lower the elevation of your chair to reduce pressure on your wrist.

When asked on Wednesday how she would deal with the issue, Ms Sugden said her approach would be \\"subtle\\". But subtle is not a word many would use to describe the debate on proposed changes to the law during the past year. The new minister was assured she has and will have the \\"full confidence\\" and \\"full support\\" of the first and deputy first ministers. That is something that Mr Ford never enjoyed. With the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in diametrically opposed on the proposed changes to abortion law, that declaration of support will be strongly tested. On another contentious issue - same sex marriage - Sugden has said she plans to talk to executive ministers behind closed doors in attempt to change the approach to the issue. Of course, prisons are also highly contentious. As the daughter of a former prison officer, Ms Sugden will be more aware than most of the complexities and dangers involved. Two prison officers, David Black and Adrian Ismay, were killed during Mr Ford's time as minister, and the threat remains high. She will also be aware that her family background means every decision she makes about prisons, and the staff who work in them, will be subjected to intense scrutiny. A major reform programme has been under way for a number of years and a huge amount of work remains to be done. It was only seven months ago that a team of inspectors described Northern Ireland's high security prison at Maghaberry near Lisburn as one of the most dangerous in Europe. A follow up report in February said the situation had stabilised and improved, but it was far from a clean bill of health. Getting the funding needed to implement comprehensive reform, and improve the fabric of the prison estate, will be a huge challenge. It will also be another test of the promised support of Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness. Policing is another area of intense public and political scrutiny. The chief constable is operationally independent, but it is up to the justice minister to set high level policy objectives and, most importantly, to determine the PSNI's annual budget. George Hamilton has said several times since his appointment that budget cuts have had a huge impact on the ability of his officers to do their jobs. So the new minister probably will not have to wait long for a chunky business case to land on her desk setting out why the PSNI needs more resources. Ms Sugden faces a huge task. Mr Ford has said publicly that he could only do the job of justice minister with the assistance of a very able Special Advisor (SPAD), and the support of his fellow MLAs and the Alliance party apparatus at Stormont. His successor does not have a party to turn to for advice or support. It is herself alone.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.

Is It contains no locks; seawater flows freely through the canal. a good answer to this question? Available choices: [i] yes. [ii] no.","completion":"[ii] no. Although the statement \\"It contains no locks; seawater flows freely through the canal\\" is accurate, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about how wide the Suez Canal is. To give a more detailed and long answer, we should discuss the width and dimensions of the Suez Canal, as well as some of the history and purposes associated with its construction. The Suez Canal is an artificial waterway that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, providing a shorter and more efficient route between Europe and Asia. Stretching to a length of approximately 120 miles (193 kilometers), the canal cuts through the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt thereby eliminating the need to sail around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. The canal officially opened on November 17, 1869. Regarding its width, the Suez Canal has varied dimensions, which have changed over time because of expansion projects aimed at accommodating more massive and modern vessels. In its initial construction, the canal had a width of 72 feet (22 meters) at its base, while the surface width was about 200 to 300 feet (60 to 90 meters). The depth of the canal was also about 26 feet (8 meters) at the time. However, multiple expansion projects over the years have broadened and deepened the canal. After the most recent expansion project completed in 2015, the Suez Canal now has a depth of 66 feet (20 meters) and a width of up to 673 feet (205 meters) in certain sections. One of the unique features of the Suez Canal is that it doesn't have any locks. Locks are essentially watertight chambers that act as water elevators for ships, allowing them to move from one elevation to another. Since the Suez Canal traverses a low-elevation region, the water level in the canal remains nearly constant, and seawater can flow freely between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The Suez Canal plays a critical role in global shipping and trade, as it significantly reduces the distance and time taken for shipping goods between Europe and Asia, contributing to cost reductions and higher efficiency. It facilitates the flow of approximately 8% of global maritime shipping, making it one of the most important waterways in the world. In conclusion, the Suez Canal's width varies along its length, with sections up to 673 feet (205 meters) wide after recent expansion efforts. The absence of locks in the canal allows for seawater to flow freely, making it a unique and vital waterway for international trade and shipping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down. In which stage the gas molecules would collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder, stage A or stage B?","completion":"To determine in which stage the gas molecules would collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder, we need to consider the effect of temperature on the gas particles. Step 1: Understand the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy The kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to temperature. When the temperature of a gas increases, the average kinetic energy of its particles also increases, causing them to move faster. Conversely, when the temperature decreases, the average kinetic energy of the particles decreases, and they move slower. Step 2: Compare the temperature in stage A and stage B In stage A, the gas is at room temperature. In stage B, the gas is heated up, meaning the temperature is higher than in stage A. Step 3: Compare the kinetic energy of gas particles in stage A and stage B Given the relationship established in step 1, the average kinetic energy of gas particles in stage B will be higher than in stage A, since the temperature is higher in stage B. Step 4: Determine the forcefulness of collisions with the interior surface of the cylinder in stage A and stage B As the gas particles in stage B have higher kinetic energy, they will move faster and collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder than in stage A. Conclusion: In stage B, the gas molecules will collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder compared to stage A."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In other words, as NPR reports, the business of being a butler is booming. \\"When you're talking about hiring a proper British butler—the guy in the uniform who obeys a certain protocol of service—what you're hiring is essentially a status symbol,\\" says David Katz, who went through 2,700 \\"butler school\\" and wrote about the trend for GQ. And now everyone from Russian oligarchs to billionaires in Dubai and China \\"want an Anglo person that telegraphs to their other equally wealthy friends that they can afford to do this.\\" Katz runs through a few lessons of butler school—for example, if your kid is sick, your boss, aka your \\"principal,\\" had better not ever know about it—as well as the cold hard cash involved; butlers can start at between 30,000 to 60,000, but many earn hundreds of thousands. But as with everything, things these days just ain't what they used to be: \\"They used to [stay put], and there's a certain pride in those that do, but because of the great demand—like with any great market—there's been a lot of jumping around lately,\\" Katz says, which \\"bugs some of the older butlers.\\" Katz's biggest problem?

This trend has been inspired by TV shows that showcase the lives of wealthy British families of the 20th century and their reliance on domestic help. According to David Katz, who studied in a butler school that cost him 2,700 and wrote an article about the trend in GQ magazine, when a person hires a genuine British butler who follows a specific service protocol and wears a uniform, what they're really getting is a status symbol. This symbol tells their equally rich friends that they have the means to afford such a luxury. These days, rich people from all over the world, such as Russian business tycoons and billionaires residing in Dubai and China, are hiring butlers. The idea is to have a British person around them as a sign that they can afford such a luxury. Mr. Katz also explains some things that are taught in butler school. For instance, if the butler's child is unwell, the employer, also known as the \\"principal\\", should never know about it. As for the salary of a butler, it can start anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000, but many butlers earn hundreds of thousands of dollars. But things aren't the same anymore. Although butlers used to stay in one place for a long time, they've started to move around a lot more because of the high demand for their services. The market is so good that there's been a lot of job hoping, which is upsetting to older butlers. Mr. Katz's main concern with the job is the requirement to be completely dedicated to fulfilling every single one of the employer's desires without question or excuse. This was very challenging for him, as he found it hard to keep his ego in check.

Please briefly summarize this news article: N.F.L. Teams Now Operate Under a Concussion Management Protocol It happens dozens of times in every N.F.L. game. There is a fierce collision, or perhaps a running back is slammed to the ground. Most of the time, all the players rise to their feet uneventfully. Other times, as the pileup unravels, a player gets up slowly. His gait may be unsteady. For decades in the N.F.L., the operative term for the situation was that someone “got dinged.” It was a cute, almost harmless-sounding description of what was often a concussion or a worrying subconcussive blow to the head. But with the N.F.L. agreeing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit brought by about 5,000 former players who said the league hid from them the dangers of repeated hits to the head, a backpedaling league has corrected its lingo and hastily amended its methodology. The N.F.L. now has a concussion management protocol, outlined in an inches-thick document that commands teams to institute a specific, detailed game-day and postconcussion course of action. Once, the treatment of players with head injuries varied from team to team and could be haphazard. Beginning last season, all players suspected of having a head injury — should they lose consciousness from a collision or experience symptoms like a headache, dizziness or disorientation — were required to go through the concussion protocol system. It features a broad cast: a head-injury spotter in the press box, athletic trainers on the bench, doctors and neuro-trauma specialists on the sideline and experts in neuro-cognitive testing in the locker room. The system is far from foolproof — players with serious symptoms remain in games. But as the N.F.L. grapples with a sobering threat to the welfare of its work force, not to mention a public-relations nightmare, the new concussion protocol is meant to establish a systemic, itemized policy on how potential brain injuries should be handled. Based on multiple interviews in the last three months with athletic trainers, players, doctors and head-injury specialists associated with the Giants, the following is a window into how the concussion protocol is designed to work on one team. “Before the season begins, I make it a point to tell the players that we’re never going to use the word ‘dinged’ again,” said Ronnie Barnes, the Giants’ senior vice president for medical services, who has been with the team since 1980. “It’s a traumatic brain injury. I say to the players, ‘Each time you get a concussion, you’ve injured your brain.’ ” Perhaps the most novel part of the new protocol is the advent of a head-injury spotter in an upper-level booth at every stadium. The spotter is a seasoned athletic trainer who is selected, trained and paid by the N.F.L. Also in the spotter’s booth are a video monitor and a video operator who can instantly replay a game sequence to scrutinize the mechanism of a potential head injury. The spotter watches both teams and can communicate directly with the athletic trainers and doctors on the field via telephones that ring on the benches and walkie-talkies that are wired to earpieces. Jim Gossett, the spotter for Giants games at MetLife Stadium and an athletic trainer at Columbia for more than 30 years, said he looked for players who appear out of sync. “It might be a player whose balance seems a little off, or he might be shaking his head after a hit,” Gossett said. “Sometimes it’s just someone adjusting his helmet over and over. “That’s when I call down and say to the people on the sideline: ‘You might want to check so-and-so.’ Or ‘No. 26 doesn’t look right.’ ” While the spotter is primarily looking for big hits that may lead to head or neck injuries, he also helps if a player sustains another kind of injury. As often as 15 to 20 times a game, the spotter tags videotapes of plays in which an injury has occurred or one is suspected. The videos are sent to the sideline, where they are viewed on a computer monitor behind the team’s bench. If alerted by the spotter, the team’s athletic trainers usually approach the players first. Barnes said that in a game on Nov. 23, he approached the team’s wide receivers coach to get a player removed from the field so he could be examined. (Confidentially laws prohibit Barnes from identifying a player unless the player consents to discuss his injury.) The spotter is not the only person watching for something that looks irregular on the field. In a typical game, about 10 Giants doctors and athletic trainers are on the sideline. Frequently, the symptoms are obvious, as when a player does not get up off the ground for a few seconds. In 2011, Giants long snapper Zak DeOssie was kneed in the head making a tackle on a punt, and he was prone and motionless on the turf for about six seconds before rising to his feet. When DeOssie reached the sideline, Barnes approached and said, “You’re out of the game.” Answered DeOssie: “On whose authority?” DeOssie began yelling and arguing. “I felt fine, like nothing had happened,” DeOssie said this month. “I was absolutely convinced I hadn’t been knocked out.” DeOssie did not return to play, and the next day he saw the tape of the play in question. “I went to Ronnie Barnes and thanked him,” DeOssie said. “Sometimes, as a player, you have to be protected from yourself.” DeOssie’s case involved a quick and, in Barnes’s view, obvious medical decision. Not everything is as cut and dried. No two concussions are alike. Under the new concussion protocol, a player suspected of having a head injury is interviewed and put through a battery of tests on the bench by a team doctor. Joining the examination is a neurologist or neurosurgeon hired by the league and not directly affiliated with the team. There are two of these league doctors, known as independent neuro-consultants, assigned to every game — one on each sideline. The initial questioning of the player is fairly standard: What quarter is it? Who scored last? Do you have a headache? Dizziness? Nausea? The doctors also put the player through exercises meant to test his balance and cognitive skills. Sometimes, the doctors simply have the player wait on the bench so he can be observed. “The athletic trainers, who are around these guys six or eight hours a day, can usually spot if someone is not acting normally,” said Dr. James Kinderknecht, the Giants’ sideline physician who most often conducts the initial evaluation. Dr. Philip Stieg, the neurosurgeon-in-chief at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, often works Giants games at MetLife Stadium as one of the N.F.L. neuro-consultants. He said that the sideline exam was not substantively different from one he would give patients in his office. “The major difference is that 80,000 people are in the background,” Stieg said. As the game progresses, a decision has to be made whether the player should re-enter the game or be taken to the quiet of the locker room, where he would receive a more thorough neuro-cognitive examination. The decision is known as the “Go or No Go” verdict. “Because if someone is taken back to the locker room, he’s probably not going to go back into the game,” Stieg said. Each doctor interviewed for this article said a consensus in the “Go or No Go” moment is usually reached easily and without disagreements. No one recalled discord. “Ninety percent of the time, it’s pretty obvious,” Kinderknecht said. “It’s not a whole lot different than talking to somebody who is intoxicated. You can tell.” But if it involved an elite player, the decision could make or break a team’s chances in the game. The final call, if there is a difference of opinion, falls to the team doctor, who is very likely an orthopedist or sports medicine specialist and not a neurologist. The doctors who work Giants game said that no team physician had overruled the recommendation of a league-assigned independent neuro-consultant in the two seasons since the concussion protocol was put in place. But the system established by the N.F.L may not, in every case, ensure the complete independence of the league-appointed neuro-consultant. Each of the principal Giants doctors, for example, is affiliated with the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, as are four of the five neuro-consultants who work Giants games. In that sense, the doctors are linked colleagues who may share bosses. Asked if the arrangement compromises the independent dynamic the process is trying to achieve, Stieg said: “I’ve never experienced any kind of pressure to get some player into a game. The N.F.L. told us, ‘We want you to be another set of eyes protecting the player.’ “I’m not paid enough, nor is there enough in this, that I would do something harmful to a patient that also negatively impacts my reputation, which I’ve built 30 years to acquire.” Dr. Nitin Sethi, a Columbia NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital neurologist who is another of the league-appointed doctors working Giants games, said he had not seen any threat to the integrity of the process. “We may be from some related institutions, but I haven’t seen any sort of obstruction,” he said. “They’ve given me a free hand.” The league-appointed Giants doctors work only home games; doctors based in other cities and affiliated with a variety of hospitals work the away games. For all the measures taken by the team and the league to sift out concussed players, those with concussions sometimes remain in games. They either purposely or unwittingly do not report their symptoms, and they successfully or involuntarily mask any physical reaction to the injury. Giants linebacker Jacquian Williams played the entire game in Seattle on Nov. 9, and a day later he reported having a headache. Tests confirmed a concussion, and Williams has not played since. He will be benched again this weekend. “It is disturbing when they show up after a game with concussion symptoms,” said Barnes, who was referring to cases he has seen over the years, not Williams’s situation. “They’ll say, ‘I took a hit and I didn’t think it was that bad, so I stayed in.’ “Since high school, some of these guys have had episodes where they’ve taken a hit and felt something but got through it. We have to change that way of thinking.” It is becoming more commonplace for players to self-report a head injury. The same day Williams played the entire game in Seattle, Giants running back Peyton Hillis approached a member of the medical staff to say that he wanted to be checked for a concussion. He was taken out of the game and a few days later was placed on injured reserve, ending his season. Players are also policing one another, tipping off the trainers that a teammate acted oddly in the huddle. Gossett said he had seen game officials alerting medical personnel as well. If a player is removed from the bench area because he is suspected of having a concussion, inside the locker room, a team doctor, an athletic trainer and the league-appointed neuro-consultant will give him a more thorough assessment. Since all the players take a series of neuro-cognitive tests, known as baseline testing, in the summer, the team can, in some cases, have the player take a version of those tests in the locker room and compare the scores. One tool is a software application designed for N.F.L. teams known as the X2 and used on portable touch-screen devices. The player is asked about his symptoms and taken through standardized neuro-cognitive questions — remembering and repeating up to six digits forward and back — and physical assessments not unlike tests that police officers give to drivers suspected of drunken driving. A player suspected of having a concussion, or clinically determined to have one, is not allowed to conduct news media interviews afterward and is instructed to avoid physical and mental activity. The player sees one of the league-appointed neurologists, usually two days after the game. When the player becomes symptom-free, he is required to follow a step-by-step recovery that begins with light physical exertion and gradually increases in intensity (as long as the activity does not cause concussion symptoms to return). The Giants do not clear the player for a full practice or a game until he visits with a neurologist a second time. Many players are back within a week. Some can miss months. “I tell every player I see about the short-term ramifications and things like chronic traumatic encephalopathy,” the neurologist Sethi said, referring to the progressive degenerative disease that has been found in the brains of multiple dead football players and athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. Sethi continued: “They listen. I’ve found that a lot of them know about C.T.E. and are worried about it.” In the 1980s, when Barnes suspected that a player had a concussion, he would lock the player’s helmet in a trunk to keep him from re-entering the game. Some other players rested on the bench for a quarter or a half and, if cleared by doctors, they would resume playing. “We don’t do that anymore, which is good,” Barnes said. Now in his 35th season in the N.F.L., Barnes sees that as progress, but two years into the league’s elaborate concussion management protocol, he admits that the process needs to evolve. “We really need more education for the players so they know to report their symptoms and not consider playing with them,” Barnes said. “Players are more aware, but I want all of them to come to us and say: ‘I have a headache. I saw stars on that hit.’ “I want the players to take it more seriously. That’s why I refer to it as a traumatic brain injury. I want to be sure they hear that.” A version of this article appears in print on November 30, 2014, on page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Concussions, by the New Book.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the nickname of the person who meets Violet Worthing at training camp? On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter. Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class. Pru makes an impassioned plea for all the good things that England represents, but when she wakes up the next morning, Clive has gone, leaving her a letter of goodbye.

She began by printing out a list of minerals. “I discovered that any stone or rock of any kind is already a hedge fund,” said Fox. She concocted the name Titanite. (“Because Titanium is already a fund,” she explained.) In making “Equity,” which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival, Fox and producers Sarah Megan Thomas and Alysia Reiner did a lot of homework. The movie, starring Anna Gunn (“Breaking Bad”) as a finance executive guiding a controversial tech company to an IPO, was built on interviews with women at all levels of finance. They heard stories of high-powered executives hiding their pregnancies from colleagues, and found it refreshing to meet ambitious women who explained why they stayed in the grueling profession with, “I like money.” The research was rooted in a hope that the movie wouldn’t turn into “Wolf of Wall Street” excess but instead offer a look at the real experiences of finance professionals. As Reiner explained: “There are no drugs. There are no hookers. But there is drama.” Gunn, in her first feature role since breaking out as Skyler White on “Breaking Bad,” is taking on a rare role in Hollywood: the female Wall Street executive. “It’s a different perspective,” said Trevor Groth, Sundance’s director of programming. “It’s a different gaze.” The “Equity” idea came to Thomas after hearing the stories and meeting the colleagues of her husband, who works at Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Reiner, who admitted she doesn’t emotionally connect to most Wall Street movies, came on board after meeting with a management consultant who shared stories of women dropping out of the financial work force. The movie was purchased for distribution at the festival by Sony Pictures Classics, and the producers said they’re developing a television series based on the film. Wall Street’s quirks and practices were laced throughout the making of the film. The filmmakers brought on consultants who crunched the script’s numbers to make sure the valuations added up. Some potential investors weren’t cleared by their compliance department to partner on the film. And when the filmmakers tried to use audio of real Wall Street traders shouting on the exchange floor, no one currently working was allowed to participate. “It was really important to all of us that it feel authentic,” said Fox. “People tend to complain that Wall Street doesn’t resemble the real thing [in movies].” Now, the team says they view Wall Street differently than they did before making the movie. “Equity” concerns a social media company going public — which Reiner sees as an existential quandary. “We are valuing these companies like Facebook and Twitter at billions of dollars and yet there is no there there,” she said. “It’s not a commodity like gold or sugar or pork bellies.” For the latest entertainment news Follow @WSJSpeakeasy What was this article about?","completion":"\\"Equity\\" is a new Wall Street drama movie that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, offering a rare look at Wall Street from a woman's perspective.

Information: - Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\". - Karma to Burn, sometimes known as K2B, is a desert rock/stoner rock band from Morgantown, West Virginia comprising guitarist William Mecum, bassist Eric Clutter, and drummer Evan Devine. The band are noted for their uncompromising, mostly instrumental sound. - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Sirenian Shores is an EP by the Norwegian gothic metal band Sirenia . It includes a remix of \`\` Save Me from Myself '' ( from the second album An Elixir for Existence ) , an acoustic version of \`\` Meridian '' ( from the first album At Sixes and Sevens ) , and three new songs : \`\` Sirenian Shores '' , \`\` Obire Mortem '' and a cover of Leonard Cohen 's \`\` First We Take Manhattan '' . The EP was released on 11 October 2004 by Napalm Records . - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - An Elixir for Existence is the second studio album by the Norwegian gothic metal band \\"Sirenia\\", released in 2004. The album follows in the same vein as the previous \\"At Sixes and Sevens\\", but includes a new female vocalist, Henriette Bordvik. - Falkenbach is a viking metal group from Germany that is signed to \\"Prophecy Productions\\". The name means \\"\\"Falconbrook\\"\\" in German. The one permanent member is Vratyas Vakyas (real name Markus Tümmers). They are one of the very first Viking metal bands, starting in 1989, with their first release that same year. - Stoner rock or stoner metal is a musical subgenre which combines elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, acid rock, doom metal, and blues rock. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock.\\" Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early-1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. - Jennifer Jean Warnes (born March 3, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer. Famous for her compositions, interpretations and her extensive repertoire as a vocalist on movie soundtracks, she was also a close friend and collaborator of Canadian singer-songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen. - Abigor is an Austrian atmospheric black metal band formed in 1993. They are named after an upper demon of war in Christian demonology. - Brant Bjork (born March 19, 1973) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer from Palm Desert, California. He is perhaps best known as the drummer and founder of the influential Californian stoner rock band Kyuss. Bjork played in Vista Chino, along with former Kyuss vocalist John Garcia. Until October 2014 when Nick Oliveri announced that there was a falling out and that Bjork and Garcia would continue working on their solo projects. He is one of the more notable figures in the stoner rock and Palm Desert scenes. - Monster Magnet is an American stoner rock band. Hailing from Red Bank, New Jersey, the group was founded by Dave Wyndorf (vocals and guitar), John McBain (guitar) and Tim Cronin (vocals and drums). The band first went by the names \\"Dog of Mystery\\", \\"Airport 75\\", \\"Triple Bad Acid\\" and \\"King Fuzz\\" before finally settling on \\"Monster Magnet\\", taken from the name of a 1960s toy made by Wham-O, which Wyndorf liked when he was a child.<ref name=\\"http://www.monstermagnet.net/bio.htm\\"></ref> - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Death-doom is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double kick drumming of death metal. The genre emerged in the mid-1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century. In turn, death/doom gave rise to the closely related genre of funeral doom as well as to the more melodic and romantic gothic metal. - \\"First We Take Manhattan\\" is a song written by Leonard Cohen. It was originally recorded by Jennifer Warnes on her 1986 Cohen tribute album \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\", which consisted entirely of songs written or co-written by Cohen. - Leonard Norman Cohen (September 21, 1934 November 7, 2016) was a Canadian singer, songwriter, musician, poet, novelist, and painter. His work mostly explored religion, politics, isolation, sexuality, and personal relationships. Cohen was inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame as well as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honor. In 2011, Cohen received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Napalm Records is an Austrian independent record label focused on heavy metal and hard rock. Originally, Napalm focused mainly on black metal bands such as Abigor and Summoning and folk metal bands such as Falkenbach and Vintersorg. Later on, the label expanded its roster by adding gothic metal, symphonic metal, power metal, doom metal, and metalcore bands, as well as stoner rock acts Monster Magnet, Karma to Burn, and Brant Bjork. Napalm has its own publishing house named Iron Avantgarde Publishing. - Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success. - Vintersorg (\\"Winter Sorrow\\" in English) is a Swedish band from Skellefteå, formed in 1994 under the name Vargatron (Wolfthrone in English). Musically, Vintersorg has covered a wide number of heavy metal genres; while the band is mostly rooted in extreme metal styles, particularly black metal and Viking/folk metal, it has also expanded into progressive metal and avant-garde metal. Lyrically, the band deals with topics on fantasy, mythology, nature, the cosmos, and metaphysics. Vintersorg means \\"Winter Sorrow,\\" but the name was taken from The Legend of the Ice People series by Margit Sandemo, where the character Vintersorg is the son of a great pagan leader. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. 'sirenian shores' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'genre'?

This occurs when naturally occurring forces such as water, ice, wind, or gravity move sediment or debris and cause it to interact with the rocks. These forces are critical in engaging the particles with the rocks, facilitating the subsequent steps in the process of rock erosion and breakdown. To provide more context, we can reformulate the process with the missing step included: 1. The initiation of contact between rocks and particles: Natural forces like water, ice, wind, or gravity transport sediment or debris and cause these particles to come into contact with rocks. 2. The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks: As the particles come into contact with the rocks, they remove tiny fragments through abrasion or chipping away at the rock's surface. 3. The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks: This ongoing contact generates further wear and breakdown of the rock's surface due to the repetitive erosive action of the particles. 4. The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact: The cumulative effect of the particle contact leads to the splitting or disintegration of the rock into smaller sections or pieces. 5. The pieces of the rock are now small rocks: Once the rock has been fragmented, the resulting small rocks become susceptible to the same forces and contact with particles that initiated the process. 6. The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces: The natural forces and particle interactions that initiated the process continue to act on the small rocks, breaking them down into even smaller pieces, eventually turning them into sediments like sand or silt. This constant cycle contributes to the ever-changing landscape and formation of new geologic features."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor.

An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for half an hour to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13 km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.Identity parades were held at Bishopsgate police station on 23 December. Isaac Levy, who had seen the group leaving Exchange Buildings, identified Peters and Dubof as the two he had seen carrying Gardstein. It was also ascertained that Federoff had been witnessed at the events. The following day Federoff, Peters and Dubof all appeared at the Guildhall police court where they were charged with being connected to the murder of the three policemen, and with conspiracy to burgle the jewellery shop. All three pleaded not guilty.On 27 December the poster bearing Gardstein's picture was seen by his landlord, who alerted police.

The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which patient would more likely risk cardiovascular disease, patient A or patient B? Greg is a doctor with the city hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A maintains a high-fat diet, but patient B does not maintain a high fat diet. Greg is advising the patients how lifestyle change can improve their health. Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, patient A would more likely risk cardiovascular disease. This conclusion is drawn from the information that patient A maintains a high-fat diet. The passage explains that though some lipids are essential in a diet, having excessive dietary lipids, usually from a high-fat diet, can be detrimental to health outcomes. This is primarily due to the reason that high-fat diets may lead to unhealthy weight gain, increased lipid levels in the blood, the narrowing of arteries and thereby increasing the risk of diseases like atherosclerosis, a form of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, given that patient A follows a high-fat diet and Patient B does not, it is more likely that patient A is at higher risk for cardiovascular disease considering the factors stated above."},{"prompt":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: What did Rathbone give to Wu Chow? The dagger that killed the Keeper of the Imperial Seal Answer:","completion":"Title: Blood of the Red Dragon In the 13th century, during the reign of the Song Dynasty in China, Wu Chow (Li Jing) is a young and talented martial artist, aspiring to serve the Emperor and protect the kingdom from corruption and treachery. Destiny colludes with blood and steel when Rathbone (Chen Kuang), a mysterious and seasoned British East India Company mercenary/adventurer, crosses paths with Wu Chow.

I'm not too picky when it comes to hotel accommodations. I've stayed at hotels ranging from Circus Circus to Polo Towers to The Wynn and almost every other hotel in between. But I have never experienced such terrible service as I did at Caesar Palace. I had booked 3 rooms for the weekend and was told the rooms will be ready by 4 pm for my friend to check in. By 4 o'clock only 1 of the rooms was ready. No biggie though, I didn't need the room immediately. At 6:45 pm my sister arrived and tried to check in for the other 2 rooms, front desk told her house keeping was cleaning the other rooms which will take about 10 minutes, the rooms will not be in the same tower with the first one because there are no rooms available and the rooms will not be next to each other. WTHECK?! Really Caesar Palace, is it that difficult to arrange for 3 rooms to be in the same tower at least?! Anyways, 10 minutes roll by still the rooms are not available, 30 minutes later still nothing, 1 hour later still nothing... 9:30 pm and still my other 2 rooms were not available. To make matters worse, I had 8 guests waiting- not able to grab dinner and not able to get ready for the night out! Finally I arrived at 10 pm and was furious because the rooms were \\"supposedly\\" still not available. After throwing a fit and almost on the verge of throwing the front desk man into the fountain, the rooms were magically available and incidentally next to one another. To make matters worse, they only offered the rooms to be complimentary for the night and an upgrade with kings beds not 2 twins. In conclusion, Caesar Palace can offer bad customer service so be aware if you decide to stay here. They overbook the rooms and do not prepared to accommodate their guests when they are over capacity. So aside from the whole rooms ordeals, I don't think I can stay at Caesars Palace in the future again because the rooms definitely need some upgrading, the selection of food/places to dine at are minimal, wow it's quite a trip from the parking lot to the hotel and Oh Yea, service can be a hit or miss.

Their house is near the house where the massacred family lived. As told by the neighbors, four years prior, a girl named Carrie-Ann Jacobson killed her parents, then fled into the forest and was never seen again, leaving her brother Ryan (Max Thieriot) as the sole survivor.

Madonna Badger, mom of three daughters killed in Christmas blaze, cries as she gives eulogy ‘My little girls are in my heart’ Madonna Badger, boyfriend Michael Borcina (r.), and estranged husband Matthew Badger (l.) comfort each other as the caskets carrying the three children killed in a Christmas Day fire are taken into funeral service. The first mourners showed up an hour early, exchanging hugs on the church steps. A steady stream of the Badger family’s loved ones followed. And then came the entire Stamford, Conn., fire department, about 70 firefighters dressed crisply in dark suits and not saying a word. Nearly 1,000 people were packed into the St. Thomas Episcopal Church in midtown by the time Madonna Badger rose to give a eulogy no mother should ever have to give. Badger stepped up to the lectern and glanced at the three caskets arranged in front of her. Her lips were trembling. The overflow crowd was silent. Then, choking back sobs, the fashion ad exec told them about her three daughters, who were killed in a Christmas Day inferno at her Connecticut mansion, along with her mom and dad. “My little girls are not gone from us entirely because my little girls are in my heart. Right here,” Badger said, motioning toward her chest. “And this is where they live.” Badger, flanked by church workers, had to walk around her girls’ mahogany caskets on her way to the dais. They sat side-by-side, topped with white and pink flowers. The mourners, including designer Calvin Klein, actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Badger’s estranged husband, Matthew, dissolved in tears as she reminisced about her “little girl tribe.” Badger described each of them one by one, stopping several times to compose herself. More than once, a church worker had to come forward to give the shattered mother a fresh tissue. Nine-year-old Lily sang before she could speak and had a thousand-watt smile. “Lily was naturally shy, but when she let her smile glow, it glowed completely,” Badger said. Lily loved many things, Badger said, but nothing more than her 7-year-old twin sisters, Grace and Sarah. “They were her best friends,” she said. Sarah once passed out cookies at a nursing home. Afterward, she told her grandma, “Someone ought to tell the tooth fairy this is where she needs to bring the teeth because they really need her.” Sarah often stayed up late talking to her mom — a memory that caused Badger to break down for several seconds. “Sarah liked to lie with me at night and hold my hand and tell me how much she loved me,” Badger said. Grace loved math and crafts, always building objects out of Band-Aids, and was curious about everything. “For Christmas, Gracie wanted a telescope and microscope,” Badger said. “She wanted to see the seen and unseen.” ‘Why my children?’ Badger recalled a particularly painful conversation she had with Grace years ago. “Gracie asked a thousand times if she was going to die before me,” Badger said. “I said, ‘No. That’s never going to happen.’ “But it did, and I wonder why. Why my children? Why my parents?” The firefighters’ eyes were wet with tears. Many had responded to the massive blaze that engulfed Badger’s three-story Stamford, Conn., mansion about 4:50 a.m., but were unable to save her three girls and parents. The bodies of the girls and their grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, were found on the top two floors. Two of the children were found in separate parts of the home — one just a few feet away from her grandfather, the other near her grandmother. Badger and her boyfriend, Michael Borcina, barely escaped. Both suffered injuries while trying to find the children amid the flames and thick smoke. The inferno was ignited by a bag of embers from a Yule log that had been removed from the fireplace because the children were concerned Santa would be burned, authorities said. After the 90-minute service, Badger let out a piercing wail as she walked out of the church, trailing behind the coffins. “No mother should have to endure what she has endured,” said family friend Gillian Brandt, 55. “How she is finding the strength to go on . . . I just don’t know.” rschapiro@nydailynews.com ||||| Matthew and Madonna Badger watch as the caskets carrying the bodies of their three daughters arrive for funeral services on Jan. 5, 2012 (John Moore/Getty Images) By Sonja Sharp and Wil Cruz DNAinfo Staff MIDTOWN — Inconsolable mother Madonna Badger tearfully remembered her young daughters — who were killed along with her parents in a devastating Christmas Day fire at their Stamford, Conn. home — at their somber funeral Thursday as dancers, singers and little angels. Badger, who escaped the horrific blaze along with her friend Michael Borcina, joined the girls' father Matthew Badger, and hundreds of mourners to say goodbye to Lily, 10, and twins Grace and Sarah, who were 7, at the St. Thomas Church on 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue. \\"They were my little girl tribe,\\" said Badger as she choked back tears. \\"And I want you to hear about them from me. \\"My girls are in my heart, and that is where they live now, and they live in me. I want to remember my girls out loud.\\" The girls' father was so distraught that he could not speak. Instead, the priest, Rev. Dr. William Shillady read a heart-wrenching note to the rapt mourners, many of whom broke down during the service. \\"A day with Lily was like a day with a beautiful song,\\" the dad said in the note. \\"She was so vulnerable and beautiful. She always wanted a grown up around her at night — in the end, she was right.\\" The fatal fire, sparked by ashes from the fireplace that were left near the house, ripped through the 100-year-old building, trapping Badger's daughters and parents, Lormer and Pauline Johnson, inside. Lormer Johnson, a former Saks Fifth Avenue Santa Claus, was found near the body of one of the girls and was believed to have been trying to save her, according to reports. And in a tragic twist, investigators believe the ashes were removed so that the girls wouldn't worry about Santa coming down the chimney, the Associated Press said. They are also trying to determine if the house, which was under renovation, had working smoke detectors. As the family processed behind the girls' identical coffins draped in lillies and other flowers, mourners moved into the aisle to embrace the grieving parents. Several rows were packed with Stamford firefighters who fought desperately to free the trapped family but were pushed back by intense smoke and flames. Madonna Badger, who once lived in Manhattan and was an art director for Calvin Klein, remembered her first daughter Lily as a shrinking violet who loved to sing and dance. \\"Lily was the angel of my heart and my first baby,\\" Badger recalled. \\"She made up songs constantly.\\" She loved dolls and her stuffed animals, \\"but most of all she loved her sisters,\\" Badger said. The eldest girl had asked her mother about dying, Badger said. On a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lily, then 5-years-old, collapsed to the floor and begged her mom to tell her when she would die. The funeral procession for Madonna Badger's family arrives at St. Thomas Church on 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue on Jan. 5, 2012. Badger's parents and three young daughters were killed in a fire on Christmas Day. (DNAinfo/Paul Lomax) \\"I told her life is a mystery,\\" Badger said. \\"We never know when we're going to die. And she accepted that.\\" One of Lily's friends, Audrey, 9, grave the grieving mom a poem she wrote entitled \\"Hope,\\" which she read aloud at the service. Grace, a second grader, was the explorer of the three girls, who loved making crafts and excelled at math. \\"For Christmas she wanted a microscope and a telescope,\\" said her heartbroken mom. \\"Grace asked me a thousand times if she was going to die before me. I said, 'No, No, that's never going to happen,' but it happened.\\" Her inseparable twin Sarah was remembered as the social butterfly of the pair with a big heart — relishing the opportunity to pass out Christmas cookies at an old age home with her grandfather. Sarah was so popular, in fact, that her schoolmates competed for her attention. \\"The principal had to call a meeting of second grade girls so they could figure out how to take turns being close to Sarah,\\" Badger said. But mostly, she was mommy's little girl. \\"Sarah used to like to lie in my bed and tell me how much she loved me,\\" said a weeping Badger, who was consoled at the funeral by the girls' father Matthew Badger and Borcina. \\"Sarah was so lovable and vibrant,\\" her dad said in his note. \\"She saw the goodness in all of us.\\" Mourners — among whom were singer Lou Reed, actor Philip Seymour Hoffman and clothing mogul Calvin Klein — were touched by the Badgers' strength throughout the ordeal. \\"I can't imagine how they're even standing up,\\" said James Gilroy, a family friend. \\"I thought what she said was just beautiful.\\" As a parent himself, Gilroy said he could scarcely imagine losing a child, much less three. \\"I have a little girl 11 years-old.\\" Gilroy said. \\"It's the worst thing I've ever heard.\\" After the service ended, Madonna Badger wept loudly as she walked out of the church. \\"Grace was fearless,\\" she said. \\"Nothing will bring my parents back, or my children. In all this incomprehensible loss and chaos love is everything,\\" she said. \\"I used to say I could never ever live through losing my babies — but here I am.\\" Donations in memory of the children can be made to The Other 364 Foundation.

At the company, Mike meets Ed Porter, a 28-year-old information technology consultant and calls him to fix his home's Wi-Fi signal, which his daughter complains is slow. Porter also upgrades the Global Positioning System in Mike's car and claims that he also worked at the National Security Agency and had taken part in a military exercise in Kandahar. Porter meets Kaitlyn and starts a relationship with her through social media, but Mike fires him after Kaitlyn invites Porter into the house; this ends his promising career at the company. Devastated, Porter begins to remotely access Mike's private data and his house as he covertly monitors them through the security cameras and devices all over the house.

Article: Before the opening of the Cape Cod Canal in 1914,the only way ships could leave Boston was on a route around Race Point--the northern tip of Cape Cod.However,navigation during the 18th century was a nightmare,because the floating cross current around Race Point caused countless accidents.So building a lighthouse to lighten the place was very necessary. As early as 1808,the people of Provincetown requested a lighthouse on Race Point,but it took Congress eight years to react when they finally paid 8,000 on April 27,1816 to build a lighthouse --Race Point Light,which was located in the town of Provincetown,Massachusetts.It was first built of stone 25 feet high with no foundation and its light was 30 feet above the sea.It was equipped with one of the nation's earliest revolving lights. Actually,there were two other lighthouses on Cape Cod,but they were hit by a storm in October 1841.In the following year,Race Point Light was examined by I.W.P.Lewis,who realized the light's importance.He said,\\"The light should be useful to all ships leaving Boston.However,its _ power is so weak that people would hardly be able to differentiate it from the lights set on the ships which stay in the bay,or close by.It hasn't played its role as a lighthouse well.\\" The result was that old lighthouse was destroyed and a new iron lighthouse with a proper foundation was put up to take its place.The new lighthouse was 45 feet high.Although the original keeper's house was in good repair,it was destroyed too and a new one was built.Today the lighthouse has been automated and Race Point Light is still an active aid to navigation. You can park at Race Point Beach and walk about 45 minutes to the lighthouse.Sunset at Race Point Light is one of the Cape Cod's most popular scenes.And at times whales can be seen in the lighthouse.For reservations to stay one night in the keeper's house at Race Point call(508)487-9930.

A:","completion":"Yes, according to the passage, Race Point Light is also a tourist spot now.

What name was given to the serial killer sought by Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs? What is the answer?","completion":"In \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" the name given to the serial killer sought by Clarice Starling is \\"Buffalo Bill.\\" Buffalo Bill is a fictional character, created by Thomas Harris for his 1988 novel \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" the second featuring his famous character Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Buffalo Bill's real name in the story is Jame Gumb, and he serves as the primary antagonist. The story was subsequently adapted into a highly successful film of the same name in 1991, directed by Jonathan Demme, with Jodie Foster starring as Clarice Starling, Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill is so nicknamed because he skins the hides of his female victims, similar to how buffalo were skinned by hunters in the past. He is driven by his urge to become a woman and intends to create a \\"womansuit\\" from the skin of his victims. Buffalo Bill kidnaps overweight women so he can starve them before killing and then carefully removing their skin. Clarice Starling is an FBI trainee tasked with interviewing Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a highly intelligent but extremely dangerous incarcerated serial killer and cannibal, to gain insight into Buffalo Bill's twisted psychology and motivations. Throughout the story, Clarice forms an uneasy alliance with Dr. Lecter, using his knowledge and help to track down Buffalo Bill, while Dr. Lecter manipulates her into revealing her personal traumas. The film showcases the gripping dynamics between Clarice Starling, Hannibal Lecter, and Buffalo Bill, as they navigate their interdependent relationships and pursue their own agendas. The character of Buffalo Bill is considered to be an amalgamation of various real-life serial killers, including Ted Bundy, Gary Heidnik, and Ed Gein, among others. The grisly portrayal of the villain and the unique, intense insights into investigative procedures and offender profiling contribute to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" becoming one of the most critically acclaimed psychological thriller movies of all time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What has already been acquired by Trafford Council for £12 million? Along with the rest of Trafford, Stretford maintains a selective education system assessed by the 11-plus examination. The proportion of pupils leaving Stretford Grammar School with five or more GCSEs at grades A*–C in 2006, was 98.3%, compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%. The proportion of students from minority ethnic backgrounds, and for whom English is an additional language, is much higher than the average. Stretford Grammar was awarded specialist Science College status in September 2005. The school was assessed as \\"good\\" in its April 2015 Ofsted report.Stretford High School Community Languages College, like Stretford Grammar, has a much higher proportion than the national average of pupils with a first language other than English, many of them being either asylum seekers or refugees. In 2004 Stretford High School was made subject to special measures, as it was considered not to be providing an adequate education for its pupils. Substantial improvement has taken place since then; the school was assessed as \\"satisfactory\\" in its November 2005 Ofsted report and was removed from special measures. Further improvements saw Stretford High School gain an \\"outstanding\\" assessment from Ofsted, following its February 2008 inspection. GCSE results also placed the school in the top 1% of schools in the country for adding value to its students.Stretford also has the specialist Arts College, Lostock College.

A group of middle school students is measuring the temperature of various liquids for a chemistry lab using a mercury thermometer. They have a beaker of boiling water, a beaker of ice water, and a beaker of water at room temperature. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, is the temperature higher or lower? Hint: A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The temperature is higher when the mercury levels rise. This is because the liquid inside the thermometer, in this case, mercury, expands when the temperature increases. This expansion of the liquid causes the mercury to rise in the glass tube, indicating a higher temperature."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role, in which he plays a body guard, called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things, and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times. This film is made in two parts, there's the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing's wrong, everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when Creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and \\"La Hermamdad\\" that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita. Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, and so did Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality. If you like excellent, slightly deranged, suspenseful thrillers, this is the one to see.

Which poisonous compound was used by a religous cult in deadly attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995????","completion":"The poisonous compound used by the religious cult in the deadly attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995 was sarin gas, a highly toxic and lethal nerve agent. The cult responsible for this act of terrorism was a Japanese doomsday group called Aum Shinrikyo, led by Shoko Asahara. Sarin, also known as GB, is a synthetic organophosphorus compound with the chemical formula (CH3)2CHO(CH3)2P(O)F. It was first developed in 1938 in Germany as a pesticide and later recognized as a potent chemical warfare agent due to its quick-acting and lethal nature. The gas works by inhibiting the proper functioning of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase in the nervous system, leading to a build-up of acetylcholine, which causes uncontrollable muscle contractions, resulting in convulsions, paralysis, respiratory failure, and eventually death. In the early morning of March 20, 1995, Aum Shinrikyo members released sarin gas in five coordinated attacks on three crowded Tokyo subway lines. The cult members boarded trains and punctured bags containing the gas with sharpened umbrella tips or newspapers wrapped in plastic. The sarin gas spread through the train cars and stations, causing widespread panic and confusion. The attack resulted in the deaths of 13 people, left more than 50 others severely wounded, and caused temporary vision problems or other after-effects in approximately 1,000 people. The incident remains one of the deadliest acts of terrorism in Japan's history and generated global shockwaves about the risks of unconventional terrorist tactics. Following the Tokyo subway attack, a massive manhunt by Japanese authorities led to the arrest of several key Aum Shinrikyo members, including its leader Shoko Asahara. In 2004, Asahara was found guilty of masterminding the sarin gas attack and other crimes, and he was sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging in 2018, along with six other cult members who played significant roles in the attack and other crimes. The Tokyo subway sarin attack was a tragic and shocking event, emphasizing the importance of international cooperation and vigilance in combating terrorism and the potential misuse of chemical agents for malicious purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bookmarked this place after seeing their pambazo torta listed in an issue of LV Weekly, as one of the Top 10 Mexican Meals of the city. I don't remember the ranking, but the description was enough to motivate me to seek this place out. I ordered the torta, and added on a mushroom quesadilla, based on another review. The quesadilla was a surprise- as others have said, I was initially surprised to see what was essentially a fried, folded tortilla, but after it cooled a bit, I took a bite. That first bite did not wow me. But after the second I took a third, and after the third, I found a mushroom. Jackpot! That thing is damn delicious when you actually get something in your bite that isn't just cheese. Wish the mushrooms were more plentiful, or more evenly distributed, because once you get that perfect bite, there's no going back. But back to the torta that originally brought me in. To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Even digging in right after I received my order, the bread was soggy to the point that it was difficult to eat with my hands. The bread appeared to be soaked in the grease from the chorizo, and I got orange all over my fingertips, hands, and mouth, simply trying to take a bite. I know better than to expect something healthy when I eat Mexican food, but this was overkill. What was most disappointing was the flavor: there really wasn't any. I could tell I was eating potatoes, and in addition to the grease, I stumbled upon some crumbles that let me know my meal contained chorizo, but nothing had flavor. I added salt, I added salsa, but there was no perking up this dish. I don't know how this torta made anyone's list of great foods, or if I simply received something other than what they usually serve- but this is not something I'd care to eat again.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Does Enterprise have more or less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does? Two stars have just been discovered that are identical in terms of chemical composition. The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them. Hint: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system. Answer:","completion":"Enterprise has less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does. Step 1: Understand the information given about the two stars Enterprise and Vader are two stars with identical chemical compositions, but Vader is a red giant while Enterprise is not. Step 2: Recall the characteristics of a red giant A red giant is a star in the last phase of its life, with decreased hydrogen fusion reactions in the core due to lack of fuel. The fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core, and the outer layer of the star expands enormously. Step 3: Make a comparison between Enterprise and Vader Since Vader is a red giant and Enterprise is not, it can be inferred that Enterprise is in an earlier phase of its life, likely with hydrogen fusion reactions still occurring in its core. This means there are fewer fusion reactions happening in a shell surrounding its core compared to Vader, a red giant with fusion reactions occurring in a shell around its core. So, Enterprise has less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Această frază se referă la importanța de a nu permite persoanelor implicate într-un delict grav să evite consecințele faptelor lor. Ca AI asistent, voi elabora în continuare pe tema acestei fraze. Din punct de vedere legal, justiția penală cuprinde diferite etape și elemente care contribuie la dezvăluirea și pedepsirea celor vinovați de infracțiuni. Când vine vorba de acte grave precum actele teroriste, crimele în masă sau alte fapte extrem de violente, este deosebit de important să se asigure că implicarea întregii rețele, inclusiv organizatorii, complicii și sponsorii acestor acte, este luată în considerare. Ancheta penală este primul pas esențial în abordarea acestui tip de cazuri. Prin investigații riguroase, organele de urmărire penală trebuie să colecteze toate probele care să le permită a identifica persoanele implicate în procesul criminal, precum și să stabilească relațiile dintre diversele elemente ale activității criminale. În acest sens, cooperarea internațională ar putea fi de asemenea crucială, dat fiind că infracțiunile grave pot avea dimensiuni transfrontaliere. După identificarea vinovaților, următoarea etapă presupune formularea acuzațiilor corespunzătoare. Procurorii au rolul de a prezenta în fața judecătorilor probele care să demonstreze vinovăția organizatorilor, complicilor și sponsorilor delictului. În plus, trebuie să dovedească fără echivoc că aceștia au avut intenția de a săvârși actul și de a socoti gravitatea faptei. Astfel, pot solicita sentințe corespunzătoare pentru fiecare dintre cei implicați. Există, de asemenea, prevederi legale prin care justiția se poate orienta spre recuperarea prejudiciilor cauzate de activitatea criminală și să indemneze victimele. Legea permite confiscarea bunurilor și a resurselor financiare ale inculpaților, atunci când acestea reprezintă produse sau consecințe ale faptelor comise. În concluzie, pentru a nu permite organizatorilor, complicilor și sponsorilor unui delict grav să evite responsabilitatea, este esențial ca mecanismele legale să funcționeze eficient și coerent, cu un accent deosebit pe investigarea rețelelor criminale și pe cooperarea internațională."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Macho Mistakes at Ground Zero As more and more workers who inhaled the dust at ground zero fall ill, it has become increasingly clear that much of the problem can be traced to the Giuliani administration’s failure to insist that all emergency personnel and construction workers at the site wear respirators. The then-mayor and his agency heads put their emphasis on a speedy cleanup and return to normalcy. In that, they were remarkably successful, clearing the site in less than 10 months. Unfortunately, the price is now being paid by thousands of workers who have developed lung and other ailments. The evolution of this tragedy was described by Anthony DePalma in The Times and other analysts. In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the twin towers, it was understandable that emergency workers would rush in in hopes of rescuing victims, and hang the precautions. But as rescue operations turned into a search for remains and then debris-removal, workers continued to ignore warnings from both city and federal officials that respirators should be worn at the site. There was some understandable delay rounding up enough of the recommended respirators. But there was no excuse for a lag in fitting the respirators to individual faces and training the workers to use them. The more fundamental problem was that many workers hate to wear respirators because they can be uncomfortable and inhibit talking. There was also a certain macho disdain, especially when authorities were putting out mixed messages about the safety of downtown air. By late October, only 29 percent of workers at ground zero were wearing the respirators, and even Mayor Giuliani visited without wearing one, setting a terrible example. This was a case where workers should have been protected against their own destructive instincts. Critics often blame the federal government — particularly the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. But a federal district judge, in allowing a suit against the city and other defendants to go forward, noted that city agencies had explicitly assumed responsibility for developing and enforcing health and safety standards, including the use of respirators. The suit may shed more light on who, if anyone, can be held liable. But the clear lesson is that Mr. Giuliani’s administration failed in its duty to protect the workers at ground zero.

Albom lived in Buffalo, New York for a little while until his family settled in Oaklyn, New Jersey which is close to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He grew up in a small, middle-class neighborhood from which most people never left. Albom was once quoted as saying that his parents were very supportive, and always used to say, \\"Don't expect your life to finish here. Context: Albom's breakthrough book came about after a friend of his viewed Morrie Schwartz's interview with Ted Koppel on ABC News Nightline in 1995, in which Schwartz, a sociology professor, spoke about living and dying with a terminal disease, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease). Albom, who had been close with Schwartz during his college years at Brandeis, felt guilty about not keeping in touch so he reconnected with his former professor, visiting him in suburban Boston and eventually coming every Tuesday for discussions about life and death. Albom, seeking a way to pay for Schwartz's medical bills, sought out a publisher for a book about their visits. Although rejected by numerous publishing houses, Doubleday accepted the idea shortly before Schwartz's death, and Albom was able to fulfill his wish to pay Schwartz's bills. The book, Tuesdays with Morrie, was published in 1997, a small volume that chronicled Albom's time spent with his professor. The initial printing was 20,000 copies. As word of mouth grew, the book sales slowly increased and landed the book a brief appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, nudging the book onto the New York Times bestseller's list in October 1997. It steadily climbed, reaching the number-one position six months later. It remained on the New York Times bestseller list for 205 weeks. One of the top selling memoirs of all time, Tuesdays With Morrie has sold over 14 million copies and has been translated into 45 languages. Oprah Winfrey produced a television movie adaptation by the same name for ABC, starring Hank Azaria as Albom and Jack Lemmon as Morrie. It was the most-watched TV movie of 1999 and won four Emmy Awards. Albom and playwright Jeffrey Hatcher later co-authored a two-man theater play that opened Off Broadway in the fall of 2001, starring Alvin Epstein as Morrie and Jon Tenney as Albom. Tuesdays With Morrie is regularly taught in high schools and universities around the world, and is also taught in some primary schools in Asia, due to its very simple writing.

Throughout these stages, the individual will encounter various milestones and experiences that contribute to their overall development and personal growth.

They will begin to form relationships, friendships, and potentially start their own families. As parents, they will provide care, guidance, and support for their children, thus beginning the cycle of life anew for the next generation. In their midlife years, adults often undergo re-evaluation of personal and professional goals, priorities, and relationships. This period may result in changes in career, relationships, and lifestyle. Achieving a work-life balance and maintaining physical and mental well-being become increasingly important during this stage. People may take on leadership roles in their professional careers, giving back to the community or mentoring the next generation of professionals. As the individual enters their later years, known as the senior stage, they gradually transition towards retirement. This stage is marked by a decrease in physical and cognitive capacities as the body naturally ages. During this time, individuals often focus on personal interests, hobbies, and leisure activities that provide meaning and enjoyment to their lives. In this stage, sustaining social connections, engaging in cognitively stimulating activities, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle assume greater importance to ensure positive well-being and a higher quality of life. Seniors may also impart wisdom, knowledge, and advice to younger generations, reinforcing the cycle of personal and collective growth.

Open my laptop on the plane and notice a Galaxy Note 7 wifi hotspot https://t.co/y1csn9gOsZ pic.twitter.com/9Z5IJULuPs — Lucas Wojciechowski (@lucaswoj) December 20, 2016 About an hour into the flight the intercom clicked on and one of the cabin crew asked that if anyone had a Note 7, they should they identify themselves. After 15 minutes and no answer, the cabin crew threatened to turn on the lights – it was 11pm by this stage – and search all passengers until they found the device. Another 15 minutes and no phone, so now the captain came on the intercom and threatened to divert the flight to an airport in Wyoming if the owner of the banned Sammy handset didn’t confess. He pointed out that as this was a nighttime flight then landing and searching everyone would be a massive pain in the backside for everyone. \\"I don't know if you've ever been diverted at 3am,\\" Wojciechowski recounts the captain saying. \\"Let me tell you, it is terrible. There is nothing open in the terminal. Nothing.\\" Thankfully, this seemed to do the trick and shortly afterwards the captain reassured passengers that the device had been found. It wasn't one of the flammable phones, but instead another model belonging to a moron who thought it would be a good wheeze to rename their mobile hotspot and pretend to be carrying a banned handset. \\"The US Department of Transportation has banned the transport of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on board all US aircraft, and Virgin America actively informs guests that they should not bring these devices onboard,\\" a Virgin spokesman told The Reg. \\"As such, when our InFlight Teammates see potential evidence of this device on board, they take it seriously. In this case, there was no such device - the safety of the passengers and crew was never in question, and no flights were cancelled or delayed as a result.\\" The crew's consternation is understandable. Not only do US transport officials take a dim view of Note 7 handsets on aircraft (particularly as there has already been an in-aircraft fire) but an in-flight blaze is many pilots' worst nightmare – barring a sudden reduction in the number of wings. While Virgin America declined to say if any action had been taken against the unfunny prankster, your humble hack hopes they make him walk home next time. ® Updated to add It is possible Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones call themselves Note 7s in their Wi-Fi network names – meaning it may have been a software bug rather than prank. ||||| 15 minutes later \\"This isn't a joke. We're going to turn on the lights\\" (its 11pm) \\"and search everyone's bag until we find it\\" ||||| SMH. SMDH. Someone recently boarded a Virgin America flight with the bright idea of leaving on a Wi-Fi hotspot named “Galaxy Note 7_1097” Since that device is banned from all planes in any capacity, the pilot rightly decided to divert the plane in an effort to focus on passenger safety. The fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 isn’t a device you want on any flight. According to BBC, the plane’s crew came across the loudspeaker and asked the owner of the phone to page the flight attendants using the in-seat call button. Nobody called the flight attendants and the phone appeared to still be broadcasting a Wi-Fi hotspot. The pilot came on the speaker next. “This isn’t a joke,” the pilot said, according to BBC. “We’re going to turn on the lights (it’s 11pm) and search everyone’s bag until we find it.” That didn’t do enough convincing. The passengers all remained mum. “This is the captain speaking. Apparently the plane is going to have to get diverted and searched if nobody fesses up soon.” That’s when someone finally admitted to owning the device. He or she wasn’t carrying a Galaxy Note 7 but, rather, had simply named his or her phone’s hotspot to suggest it was indeed that device. My guess is it was some sort of prank, perhaps meant for use in another location and accidentally forgotten about until it was spotted on the flight. BBC said this ultimately led to the delays and even a flight cancellation. Yikes. Update: Virgin America provided us with this statement, disputing claims made to BBC that any flights were delayed or canceled: “The U.S. Department of Transportation has banned the transport of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 onboard all U.S. aircraft, and Virgin America actively informs guests that they should not bring these devices onboard. As such, when our InFlight Teammates see potential evidence of this device onboard, they take it seriously. In this case, there was no such device – the safety of the passengers and crew was never in question. And to clarify in your article, no flights were cancelled or delayed as a result.” ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Airlines have banned use of the Note 7 on flights A flight in America was delayed and almost diverted on Tuesday after a passenger changed the name of their wi-fi device to 'Samsung Galaxy Note 7'.

My husband and I have been wanting to try Soul since they opened, and decided our 1 year anniversary this past weekend was the perfect occasion. We arrived at 8:00pm on a Monday and were surprised to find out there was a 30 minute wait. Around 30 min later we were sat at the bar and the food was more than worth the wait. We started out with four dishes; Baba Ghanoush dip, anchovy bruschetta, lamb cheek profiteroles, and curried lamb skewers. The Baba ghanoush with pita chips was smoky and spicy, probably the best I've ever had. The marinated Spanish white anchovies on Bruschetta were refreshing, lite, and full of flavor, everything on the bruschetta was super fresh. The profiteroles for me were by FAR the highlight of the meal and one of the top 5 dishes I've ever eaten in my life. The kitchen was on point because everything on this plate was perfection. It was the first time I've had savory profiteroles which I thought was very creative, they were stuffed with tender lamb cheek, mushroom jam, and a foie gras mousse. The three ingredients just kind of melted together and although the portion was small, they were so rich that it really ended up being the perfect amount. I would normally have a heart attack after paying 18 for 3 golf ball sized \\"sandwiches\\" but these were so good that we will probably order them every time we go back! The last dish of our first go around was the curried lamb skewers with mango chutney. The lamb was cooked and seasoned well, but there wasn't anything necessarily special about the lamb itself. But, the mango chutney was perfection, and we probably could've eaten a few bowls of that on its own. The pairing of the curry with the sweetness of the mango worked perfectly and definitely elevated the flavor of the lamb. Our second go around we ordered the Rocky Mountain Oysters, Sakana Roll, and Korean BBQ wings. The choice of the Rocky Mountain Oysters was really just out of curiosity. I always see Food Network hosts eating them when they're in Colorado and I was curious to taste them. They were perfectly cooked and incredibly tender, but I just did not care for the taste. They were good and my husband ended up eating the whole plate, but there is nothing in this world I hate more than liver, and although very mild, they did have a slight liver taste. The Sakana roll was pretty good and I really liked the combination of sauces that they served it with. Finally we had the Korean BBQ wings which were cooked perfectly. They were tender, very moist, and very flavorful. The only disappointment of the night was dessert. I was eyeing the goat cheese ice cream since I first opened up the menu and when we ordered it the waitress told us they no longer make that flavor and we must have received an old menu. That was kind of a buzzkill, but we moved on and ordered the Vietnamese coffee ice cream. This is definitely not a cheap restaurant, but up until dessert, everything we ordered was more than worth the price. The ice cream scoop was 4 and it was about a 3oz scoop barely larger than a golf ball. I guess we're kind of picky because we make ice cream at home a lot, but our 1st shot at Vietnamese coffee ice cream was better than that. It was not a huge deal, just kind of anticlimactic after such delicious savory dishes. My husband also ordered an Old Fashioned and said it was delicious. Lastly, the DJ was fantastic and one of the highlights of the night. We were seated right in front of him which was entertaining, and he was playing old school records all night which was the perfect type of music to accompany our food! All in all it was one of the best meals we've ever had and cannot wait to go back. My husband thinks we can try the whole menu in 3 more visits, which I think is a bit ambitious, but I'm sure we will get there eventually! Choose: was this review given positively or negatively?

Teenaged brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park at the original Jurassic Park site on Isla Nublar. Their aunt, Claire Dearing, is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as the boys' guide but they soon evade her. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training and researching four Velociraptors. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, Vic Hoskins, the head of InGen Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry strongly oppose. Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, Indominus rex, a genetically-engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire the Indominus lacks social skills, making it more dangerous and unpredictable. When it appears the Indominus has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives the attack, but it kills the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen tells Masrani to have the Indominus killed; to protect his company's investment, Masrani instead dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry.

Today he is focusing on the elements that all belong to the alkali metals group. He is especially focused on learning about lithium, which is at the top of the group, and cesium, which is at the bottom of the alkali metals group. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which element is the shielding effect larger? A:","completion":"The shielding effect in cesium is larger compared to lithium. The shielding effect is a phenomenon that describes the decrease in attraction between an electron and the nucleus in any atom with more than one electron shell. This happens because outer electrons are repelled by electrons in inner shells, reducing the net force of attraction from the nucleus. This repulsion by inner shell electrons is referred to as the shielding effect. In the context of the periodic table, as you move down each group, more energy levels (shells) are added. This implies that atoms get larger moving down a group, and the outermost electrons are less attracted to the nucleus due to the repulsion by inner shell electrons. Alkali metals, including lithium and cesium, belong to the first group of the periodic table. Let's take a closer look at lithium and cesium. Lithium is the third element on the periodic table, it has three protons and three electrons, two of which fill the first energy level (or are in the 1s orbital), while the third is in the second energy level (or in the 2s orbital). So, lithium has relatively few energy levels and, therefore, a relatively small shielding effect. On the other hand, cesium is much further down the periodic table. It's the 55th element, with 55 electrons spread across a total of 6 energy levels. Although only one of these electrons is in the outermost level (or in the 6s orbital), there are still many energy levels and electrons between this outermost electron and the nucleus. This leads to a strong shielding effect as the inner electrons repel the outermost one, reducing the effective nuclear charge it experiences. Therefore, cesium experiences a larger shielding effect than lithium because it has more energy levels filled with electrons that can shield the outermost electron from the positive charge of the nucleus. This is a general rule for the periodic table: the shielding effect increases as you move down a group in the periodic table, making the outer electrons less tightly held by the nucleus, resulting in bigger atomic radii, lower ionization energies, and more reactivity. This explains why cesium is more reactive than lithium, despite both being in the alkali metals group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo. The first markalong, animal A, has only one parent. The second markalong, animal B, has two parents. Although they used different forms of sexual reproduction, both animals are healthy and doing well at the zoo. Which markalong was produced asexually? Hint: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes. A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, we can determine that Markalong A was produced asexually. Firstly, let's take a look at the reproduction process of both markalongs. It is given that Markalong A has only one parent, while Markalong B has two parents. This is a crucial difference between the two animals in terms of reproduction methods. Asexual reproduction involves a single individual reproducing on its own, with no combination of genetic material, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical copies, or clones, of the parent. In contrast, sexual reproduction involves the combination of genetic material from two parents, generating offspring with a mix of traits from both parents. Now let's examine the hint, which further clarifies the distinction between asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is advantageous due to its speed and the fact that it does not necessitate male and female organisms meeting. This allows for rapid and energy-efficient reproduction. However, this form of reproduction has its drawbacks, the most significant of which is the lack of genetic diversity among offspring. As offspring are genetically identical to their single parent, any detrimental genetic characteristics or susceptibility to diseases will be passed down directly. Taking these facts into account, we can infer that Markalong A must be the offspring produced asexually. This is because it has only one parent and therefore does not benefit from the genetic diversity that would result from sexual reproduction. Conversely, Markalong B was produced sexually, as it has two parents and its genetic makeup is a mix of traits from both parents, potentially offering better resilience to diseases and adaptation to its environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A side effect of the beaver's new home is that the water behind the wall starts to slow down and gathers in one place, making a small lake or pond.

This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for \\"Like a Prayer\\". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses. This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the Vatican and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal. In 2003, MTV named her \\"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever\\" and said that \\"Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award.\\"\\"? Answer:","completion":"Question: In the passage, how does Madonna challenge traditional gender roles and blend elements of the sacred and profane in her music videos, specifically in \\"Like a Prayer\\"? What impact did this have on her public image and career, including her recognition by MTV in 2003? Answer: In the passage, it is mentioned that Madonna's music videos, notably \\"Like a Prayer,\\" allowed her to challenge traditional gender roles by subtly reversing the common portrayal of men as the dominant sex. This was achieved through her use of provocative symbolism and imagery that pushed boundaries and questioned the status quo. In \\"Like a Prayer,\\" the blending of sacred and profane elements can be observed through the inclusion of scenes featuring an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and her singing in front of burning crosses. This unique mix of religious and secular themes generated controversy, particularly among religious institutions like the Vatican. As a result, it led to the withdrawal of a Pepsi commercial featuring Madonna. Despite this controversy, the passage highlights that Madonna's bold approach to her music videos allowed her to make significant contributions to the music video art form. In 2003, MTV recognized her impact and creativity by naming her \\"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever.\\" The award highlighted how Madonna's innovation, creativity, and ability to challenge societal norms ultimately earned her a lasting place in music history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite.

His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\". Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed.

Divide both sides by the common z coefficient to get the value of z. Let's go step-by-step: 1. The given equation is 136z = -163z + 5382. 2. We will isolate z by moving all z terms to the left side of the equation. To do so, we add 163z to both sides: 136z + 163z = -163z + 163z + 5382 (136 + 163)z = 5382 3. Now, we will divide both sides by the sum of the z coefficients (136 + 163): 299z = 5382 z = 5382 / 299 By dividing 5382 by 299, we get: z ≈ 18 So the solution to the equation is z ≈ 18."},{"prompt":"Question: what is a ti 82??

What is the best way to: how to make a roux","completion":"Making a roux is a foundational technique in many culinary traditions, especially in French cuisine. A roux is a mixture of equal parts fat (usually butter) and flour, cooked together to create a thickening agent for various dishes like sauces, soups, and stews. The basic process of making a roux is not complicated, but it does require some attention and skill to achieve the desired result. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to make the perfect roux: 1. Choose the fat: The most common fat used in making a roux is unsalted butter; however, you can also use other types of fat, such as oil, bacon grease, or duck fat. Pay attention to the flavor profile of your dish when choosing the fat, as it will have a direct impact on the final taste of your dish. 2. Measure the ingredients: A roux typically consists of equal parts fat and flour. For most recipes, 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) of fat and 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour should suffice. 3. Heat the fat: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan or skillet, heat the chosen fat over medium-low heat. Be cautious not to let the fat burn or smoke, as it will affect the flavor of your roux. 4. Add the flour: Once the fat has melted and heated, add the flour gradually, whisking continuously to ensure that the mixture is smooth and lump-free. Combining the two ingredients with a whisk or wooden spoon is essential, as it will allow the flour to be thoroughly incorporated into the fat. 5. Cook the roux: The cooking time depends on the type of roux you desire. There are three main types of roux - white, blonde, and brown. Each type will have varying cooking times and require close monitoring. a) White roux: Cook the mixture for about 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. At this stage, the roux will not yet have changed color, but the flour's raw taste should have dissipated. White roux is typically used for béchamel sauce, white gravies, and cream-based soups. b) Blonde roux: Cook the mixture for approximately 5 minutes or until the roux attains a light golden color. This type of roux is used for sauces like velouté, cheese sauces, or light-colored soups. c) Brown roux: Cook the mixture for approximately 15-20 minutes or until the roux reaches a deep, nutty brown color. Ensure that the heat is low to reduce the risk of burning. Brown roux is perfect for darker sauces like espagnole or gumbos. 6. Cool the roux slightly: After achieving the desired color, remove the pan from the heat and allow the roux to cool for a couple of minutes. 7. Gradually incorporate the liquid: The type of liquid used in your dish will depend on the specific recipe. Examples include milk, broth, or stock. Slowly add the liquid to your roux while constantly whisking to ensure a smooth, homogeneous, and lump-free mixture. 8. Simmer and thicken the sauce: Return the saucepan to medium heat and cook the mixture until the desired thickness is achieved. Be patient during this process, as the sauce will continue to thicken as it simmers. 9. Season to taste: Adjust the taste of your sauce or soup with salt, pepper, or other seasonings as per your preference and the dish you are making. 10. Strain the sauce (optional): If necessary, strain your sauce through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any remaining lumps and achieve a smoother consistency. By following these steps, you will have created a perfect roux tailored to your specific dish. Practice makes perfect when it comes to making roux, so don't hesitate to experiment and refine your skills over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Instructions: Given a simple high-school level math question, you are required to solve it and provide the final answer. The final answer is always a single number. These questions can range from a variety of topics like simple arithmetic, solving equations, converting a quantity from one unit to another, finding remainders/GCD/LCM, finding probabilities etc. Each question has only one correct answer. This answer can be a positive or negative integer, a fraction or a decimal number. If the answer is a negative number use the hyphen (e.g. -42) symbol for the minus sign. For decimal numbers, do not add extra zeros after the decimal point. For fractional numbers, separate the numerator and denominator using a forward slash (e.g. 3/25).

The neutral indicator does not have a significant impact on the overall sentiment. Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment The overall sentiment leans towards Neutral because the sentence expresses both a mildly negative and a positive view towards Johan Olsson, making it difficult to classify it as strictly positive or strictly negative.

Context:This is normal ! We ca n't always have the smooch we want when we want it . We are both stressed about money and work ( lack of both ) at the moment . A is not by nature a worrier , but she 's worrying now . Question What may be the reason for their worrying ? Answer:","completion":"There could be several reasons for the individuals, particularly A, worrying in this context. Here, I will provide a detailed analysis of various factors that could be contributing to their anxiety and stress. 1. Financial stress: As mentioned, both A and B are experiencing issues related to money and work. Financial stability plays a crucial role in maintaining one's mental well-being, as it provides a sense of security and comfort. A lack of financial stability could create anxiety, as it can make it challenging to meet daily living expenses, repay debts, or save for future needs. 2. Job insecurity: The mention of the lack of work suggests that they might be going through precarious employment situations, such as unemployment, underemployment, or unstable job tenures. Job insecurity can be emotionally distressing, as paid work contributes not only to one's livelihood but also to one's identity and self-esteem. The fear of losing a job or difficulty finding one can be a major source of anxiety, often affecting one's mental well-being. 3. Relationship strain: Money and work-related stress may be causing tension and strain in their relationship. It's common for couples to experience strain under financial difficulties or unemployment, as these situations can lead to feelings of inadequacy, frustration, and insecurity. This tension can disturb the communication and emotional connection in the relationship, leading to further worry. 4. Personal predisposition to anxiety: While it's mentioned that A is not a worrier by nature, it's possible that prolonged stress has activated latent anxiety tendencies within her. Moreover, the current situation might have reached a tipping point, wherein even a resilient individual like A cannot help but worry about the present challenges they're facing. 5. Social pressure: Societal norms often dictate the expectation to be financially secure and professionally successful. In situations where individuals are unable to meet these expectations, they may feel additional pressure, which can manifest as stress and worry. They could be concerned about what others might think of their current financial and employment situation. 6. Uncertainty about the future: The future can be inherently uncertain, especially in times of financial and job-related stress. A and B may be worrying about how long their situation will last and whether they will be able to overcome these challenges. This fear of the unknown and fear of failure can exacerbate stress and anxiety. In summary, the reasons for the individuals' worrying in this context could be multifaceted, involving factors such as financial stress, job insecurity, relationship strain, personal predispositions to anxiety, social pressure, and uncertainty about the future. These challenges may have created a perfect storm of stress, making it increasingly difficult for A and B to maintain a sense of calm and well-being. Support, open communication, and seeking professional help when needed can be effective in coping with such issues and reducing their worry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Justin Bieber Leads List Of Celebrity 100 Newcomers If you thought it was impossible for a 17-year-old to debut on our list of the most powerful people in entertainment at No. 3, just behind Oprah Winfrey, Justin Bieber proves you can never say never. One of our stars to watch last year, the teen heartthrob hit the list thanks to 500 million views on YouTube and a concert movie that hauled in 100 million at the global box office. Bieber has more than 9.6 million followers on Twitter, more than Kim Kardashian, Ashton Kutcher and President Obama. In the past year, Bieber made nearly 40 million from touring. Endorsement deals, music sales and merchandising bumped him to a total of 53 million. Not too shabby for a kid barely old enough to drive. Usher, the man responsible for discovering Justin Bieber, also makes his debut on our list this year, coming in at No. 32. The R&B icon brought in 46 million in the past year from his concert appearances and album sales. He also earns from impressive sales of his back catalogue dating from the 90s. Fellow pop star Katy Perry has a lot to be happy about this past year. The California girl makes her first appearance on our list at No. 12, with total earnings of 44 million.

Kyle bought hamsters for the children, which annoyed Leslie because","completion":"Leslie always thought that having pets was a huge responsibility and would take up much of their time, effort and attention. Plus, she had a mild allergy to hamster fur, which would make things more complicated for her. Nevertheless, Kyle loved pets and thought that introducing them into their kids' lives would have a positive impact on their responsibility, emotional interactions, and companionship. When Kyle first brought the hamsters home, Leslie tried to hide her irritation, but it was clear that she was unhappy about the situation. Eventually, after some gentle prodding from Kyle, she shared her concerns about how the hamsters would be a burden on the household. The children, enthusiastic about their new pets, promised to take good care of them and give their mom enough space to avoid any allergy issues. The children chose to name the hamsters Pippin and Cocoa. Pippin was a feisty, energetic little hamster, full of enthusiasm and spunk. Cocoa, on the other hand, was calmer, gentle and very cuddly. For a while, things went smoothly, as the kids kept their promise to look after Pippin and Cocoa and Leslie managed to avoid any of her allergies flaring up. However, as time went on, the novelty of having hamsters started to wear off for the young kids. They began to spend less time cleaning the cage, feeding the pets, and playing with them. The responsibility of taking care of the hamsters started to shift back to Leslie, who would regularly chide the children for not living up to their promises, while secretly struggling with the fact that the fur was causing her more discomfort than she was willing to admit. Seeing that Leslie was having a hard time coping with the situation, Kyle stepped in and took over. He started to spend more time with the hamsters, understanding their unique personalities, and ensured they were well taken care of. He also spent more hours taking care of chores around the house, which gave Leslie some much-needed relief from the children and some time to enjoy her hobbies and to catch up on her favorite TV shows. Despite her initial frustrations, Leslie began to see the value of having pets in their children's lives as she watched how Kyle interacted with the hamsters, teaching the kids skills of empathy and compassion alongside responsibility. They even began to bond as a family over Pippin and Cocoa, with the children showing renewed interest in taking care of the hamsters, as they saw their parents make an effort. Soon enough, Leslie began to appreciate the antics of Pippin and Cocoa. While still not necessarily an avid fan of hamsters, she found herself cracking a smile as Pippin stuffed his cheeks full of food or raced around his wheel with abandon, and could even tolerate holding Cocoa for short periods of time, thanks to her gentle and cuddly personality. A small part of her started to feel relieved that Kyle had brought the hamsters into their lives. Realizing the positive impact the hamsters had on their family, Leslie confided in Kyle one evening when the children were asleep. She admitted that despite her initial annoyance and the difficulties they had faced, the new members of their household had made their family bond even stronger and taught them all valuable lessons. Together, Kyle and Leslie, along with the children, continued to grow and learn from their experiences with Pippin and Cocoa. They didn't just become better pet owners, but also a closer family, united by their shared responsibilities and understanding of the importance of compassion, empathy, and patience in life."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Given the background: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull","completion":"The phrase \\"is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull\\" would be considered negative. This statement indicates that the subject, presumably a crime drama television show or film, hasn't surpassed or even met the expectations of the evaluator. It's a negative review because it suggests that the content isn't engaging or unique enough to stand out from similar productions in its genre. Firstly, the phrase \\"standard crime drama fare\\" implies a lack of originality. It suggests that the show or movie falls into the usual or generic category of crime dramas. This is often construed negatively as it hints at a lack of innovation or creative approach to the subject matter. Secondly, the term \\"instantly forgettable\\" builds on the criticism by suggesting that the story or characters aren't compelling or memorable, which is a key element for any successful storytelling. It implies that the impact of the show or movie is so weak that it doesn't linger in the viewer's mind soon after watching. Lastly, the term \\"thoroughly dull\\" is undoubtedly negative. Labeling a show or film as \\"dull\\" bodes poorly as it implies that the plot, characters, or even the overall execution is boring or lacking excitement or intrigue. As a rule of thumb, no creator aims for their work to be perceived as dull. Overall, the phrase indicates dissatisfaction and disappointment, indicating a negative sentiment towards the crime drama being discussed. It criticizes not just certain aspects of the work, but seems to dismiss its overall value and appeal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jamie Dimon, Alibaba, and our crumbling regulatory standards FORTUNE — Mr. Dimon went to Washington, and Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba is looking to make it big in New York with an IPO. In light of the government shutdown and worldwide unrest, a reasonable reaction might be, “So what?” But if we had time-travelled directly to now from a decade ago, we’d probably have a more informed response to both incidents: alarm — followed by demands to our U.S. regulators and enforcers. J.P. Morgan JPM CEO Jamie Dimon’s visit to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder warrants a close look. Bloomberg’s Caroline Baum likened Dimon to “hero“ Hank Rearden from Ayn Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged, arguing that in facing down his judges, he is wrestling with the oppressive rule of the state. The New York Times had a slightly different, if not similarly disturbing, take. They called for readers to submit captions of the photo of Dimon’s visit to Holder. Wow, what fun. But let’s consider this: Wouldn’t every company CEO like the access available to Dimon — to visit the U.S. Attorney General personally and negotiate their way out of criminal charges? MORE: 4 debt ceiling scenarios freaking out traders The response to similar actions was markedly different 11 years ago. I remember, and maybe you do too, when Harvey Pitt resigned as SEC chief amid a series of uproars that concerned his coziness to accounting firms. One of Pitt’s pileup of controversies involved a meeting with Gene O’ Kelly, then CEO of KPMG, when that firm was under investigation related to the Xerox accounting scandal. (Full disclosure: Gene O, as he was called, and I co-authored an article together for American Banker in 1998.) Unlike the responses that we are witnessing toward the Dimon-Holder conclave, the reaction to the O’Kelly-Pitt sit-down was fiercely protective of the integrity of the enforcement process. With the past as our guide, we need to ask ourselves, why is there so little controversy over the J.P. Morgan CEO’s tête-à-tête with the U.S. A.G., the same attorney general who hasn’t prosecuted any financial chiefs post-crisis. Another situation we should be watching is the Alibaba IPO, which is expected to take place within the next year. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange refused to list the Chinese e-commerce company for governance concerns. So Alibaba is headed to the good ole’ U.S. of A. But wait a minute. When and how did the U.S. become a place where any company could list? What happened to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) being the premier worldwide exchange, which only listed the crème de la crème? Where we are now isn’t exactly a fluke. NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer promoted this path when he proclaimed loudly, even post-crisis, that high standards hurt the NYSE’s ability to attract listings. So today, there’s no badge of honor to be on the NYSE like there once was. If a company like Alibaba can’t list where they’d really like to, they can come here. And by allowing the NYSE to operate as they have, U.S. regulators have contributed to lowering governance standards internationally. The Council of Institutional Investors (CII) is not pleased with Niederauer’s stance and regulators’ laxity. Late last year, CII called on the U.S. exchanges to beef up listing requirements. Listing standards matter because they instill trust in our capital markets by providing some assurance about the quality of the listed companies. MORE: Why the 14th Amendment matters in the debt-ceiling crisis Clearly, Niederauer ‘s posture hasn’t been a magic bullet for the NYSE, anyway. The less well-known Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is taking over the NYSE as early as this month. Last week, SEC Chief Mary Jo White raised the conundrum of the dual function of exchanges as regulatory agents “even as they operate as for-profit entities.” But it’s unclear whether she will take aim at comparatively weak U.S. listing requirements that have been leapfrogged by jurisdictions like Hong Kong. The U.S. economy depends on our commitment to excel. Over the long term, we have attracted customers and capital to this country due to the superiority of our products and our markets. Lower aspirations provide no pathway to good paying jobs. By weakening U.S. standards, we become, at best, the second-choice provider. After all, we were not Alibaba’s first pick.

Movie plot title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news.

His highly technical and impeccably artistic performances set him apart from the rest of the field. 3. 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics - Evan Lysacek (United States) In a tight competition that saw the rivalry between Russia's Evgeni Plushenko and America's Evan Lysacek heat up, Lysacek emerged victorious by delivering clean and fluid programs that won over the judges. He became the first American male figure skater to win the Olympic gold since 1988. 4. 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics - Yuzuru Hanyu (Japan) Yuzuru Hanyu, at only 19 years old, became the first Japanese man to win the gold medal in men's figure skating. He set a new world record in the short program and managed to secure the gold despite a fall in his free skate performance. His unique combination of athleticism and artistry wowed audiences and judges alike. 5. 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics - Yuzuru Hanyu (Japan) Defending his Olympic title, Yuzuru Hanyu once again secured the gold medal in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Despite suffering a serious ankle injury months before the competition, Hanyu delivered a strong performance that cemented his status as one of the greatest figure skaters in history. It is essential to mention that the answer to this question would change in the future as new Olympic Games take place and new champions are crowned in men's figure skating.

Competitor In Chief Now that the election is over, the next president can stop worrying about how to get elected and start worrying about getting the country back on the right track. He doesn't get to choose the first order of business. The U.S. has no choice but to rebuild its financial system, now decimated as if by war. American households face the same urgent short-term challenge: Individuals, along with the nation, have spent beyond their means for years, and with the housing and stock market busts, are now being forced, painfully, to retrench. But even more important in the long term is the necessary adjustment the U.S. must make to maintain America's living standard. The next president has the chance to lead Americans through the global economic wilderness and into the 21st century world, one dramatically changed by the rise of China and India. For decades, China and India--each with more than a billion people--cut themselves off from the global economy. When they reconnected with the rest of the world by almost simultaneously embracing capitalism and globalization in the 1980s and 1990s, the first truly global labor pool began to form. Most Americans first felt the effects in the form of lower prices for goods and services. That is, American consumers got a break because of the rise of India and China, as cheap Chinese goods filled the Wal-Mart (nyse: WMT - news - people ) shelves. Now, the other shoe is dropping. After having had a free pass from Asian competition for decades, Americans today--not just unskilled factory workers but office workers, too--are starting to compete for jobs with Indians and Chinese. Well-educated white-collar employees in Asia are now working for and connected with American companies or their customers by inexpensive technology. All the while, Americans have been earning about 10 times more than Indians and Chinese for the same work. America's middle-class standard of living has already begun to fall. While companies benefited from double-digit productivity increases so far this decade, real income dropped 3% for middle-class households. Americans must come to terms with the fact that while they were glued to Survivor on TV, the world changed. They must be willing to upgrade their skills and change jobs or careers in response, or be content with a lower standard of living. The nation urgently needs to reinvent itself for the coming wave of still further competition from China and India, and it will be up to the next president to lead the way. There's a way to help Americans out of the current economic mess while they prepare to face global competition. The U.S. needs a 21st century-style Works Project Administration--Roosevelt's employment scheme that put millions of Americans to work building infrastructure and participating in the arts or education programs after the Great Depression. I'm not suggesting we create a vast federal agency that doles out meaningless jobs. The 21st century version would rely on the private sector to provide the jobs with targeted federal government spending, while counting on governments at the local, state and federal level to step up to both build a stronger safety net and foster business environments that encourage companies to thrive--and thus to hire. Call it the Competitiveness Project. It should have four components. First, it must rebuild America's physical and intellectual infrastructure, which needs 1.6 trillion in repairs and improvements, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Bridges and highways are crumbling. Many of the nation's airports are relics that don't belong in the world's superpower. Railroad lines, ports, even cellphone infrastructure is out of date. Not only would rebuilding wobbly infrastructure help companies in America compete, it would provide jobs for factory workers who have been laid off amid the recession or who have watched their jobs move to China and beyond. Our nation's intellectual infrastructure has also been neglected. Our future clearly lies in technological innovation, in creating jobs that require more brains than brawn. But government and companies alike have slowed their spending on basic research. That's like a farmer who refuses to spend money planting seeds. Second, America simply must fix its schools. A barrage of test scores shows that K-12 students are already far behind the world's academic leaders. American 15-year-olds were tied for 21st place in average math and science performance worldwide. When they grow up and go to work, they won't have the knowledge or skills to compete with better-educated foreigners, much less deserve to earn 10 times more for the same work like their parents do. The government must fix mediocre U.S. schools, and parents must insist that their children prepare more rigorously for the tough global competition at hand. American universities are still considered the best in the world but since the early 1990s, fewer and fewer Americans have been able to afford them. For most Americans, a college education has never been more crucial to maintaining their standard of living. A college education must be put back within financial reach of all Americans who qualify for admittance, especially during what promises to be a weak job market. In post-war years, the G.I. Bill helped upgrade the nation's workforce skills while giving returning soldiers an affordable college education. Now is a good time for a repeat of that initiative, certainly for those Americans who find a recession at home just as they return from their long deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Third, the nation must weave a new social safety net, not just to reflect our soon-to-be-higher unemployment rate but also to transition to today's truly global economy. Our current system of unemployment insurance dates to when people held jobs for 30 years with one company and then retired. It is a woeful mismatch to today's labor conditions. Americans face much higher lifetime job churn--that is one of the inevitable consequences of our new global labor market. But America's unemployment system now provides meager payments for a brief time to push the unemployed to take the first job available, even at much lower pay. Often, brief retraining would leave them--and the nation's tax base--better off in the long run. America's unemployment benefits should be reworked to allow workers to attend community colleges or training programs that can give them the kind of up-to-date skills companies need to compete in the global economy. Fourth, local and state governments especially must focus on economic development. The Council on Competitiveness suggests the U.S. embark on a campaign to create \\"regional innovation hot spots\\" that would help companies create jobs in the U.S. It's the high-tech, entrepreneurial version of the way China builds industrial parks to attract factories that hire thousands of Chinese workers. All these initiatives sound expensive, right? True, but like the 700 billion financial bailout, not spending to boost America's competitiveness would cause further pain in the short run and would cost far more in the long run. The U.S. is going to need an expensive stimulus plan to lift it out of recession amid the global downturn and should spend it on initiatives that will lay the foundation for a brighter future. Now that India and China have transformed themselves and rejoined the global economy, we are talking about nothing less critical than maintaining America's standard of living. It is our next president's greatest task. Let it be the next space race.

We have a math problem that looks like this: -203 * v + 98 * v - 15755 = 580 * v Let's think about what this means. We have some number (v) and we need to find out what it is. First, let's look at 'v' on the left side of the equation. We have -203 * v and 98 * v. We can combine them by adding -203 * v and 98 * v. It's like having a group of -203 v's and a group of 98 v's and putting them together. So, let's calculate that: (-203v) + (98v) = -105v Now, our problem looks like this: -105v - 15755 = 580v Next, we need to get all the 'v' terms on one side of the equation. Let's move the -105v from the left side to the right side by adding 105v on both sides: (-105v + 105v) - 15755 = 580v + 105v This simplifies to: -15755 = 685v Now, we just have one 'v' left, and we need to find out what number it stands for. We can do this by dividing both sides by 685: -15755 ÷ 685 = 685v ÷ 685 -23 = v So, the number we were searching for, or 'v', is -23.

Stanley Kirk Burrell (born March 30, 1962), better known by his stage name MC Hammer (or simply Hammer), is an American hip hop recording artist, dancer, record producer and entrepreneur. He had his greatest commercial success and popularity from the late 1980s, until the early 1990s. Remembered for his rapid rise to fame, Hammer is known for hit records (such as \\"U Can't Touch This\\" and \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\"), flashy dance movements, choreography and eponymous Hammer pants. A multi-award winner, M.C. Hammer is considered a \\"forefather/pioneer\\" and innovator of pop rap (incorporating elements of freestyle music), and is the first hip hop artist to achieve diamond status for an album. Before Hammer's successful music career (with his mainstream popularity lasting approximately between 1988 and 1998) and his \\"rags-to-riches-to-rags-and-back saga\\", Burrell formed a Christian rap music group with CCM's Jon Gibson (or \\"J.G.\\") called Holy Ghost Boys. Some songs produced were called \\"Word\\" and \\"B-Boy Chill\\". \\"The Wall\\", featuring Burrell (it was originally within the lyrics of this song he first identified himself as K.B. and then eventually M.C. Hammer once it was produced), was later released on Gibson's album Change of Heart (1988). This was Contemporary Christian music's first rap hit ever. Burrell also produced \\"Son of the King\\" at that time, releasing it on his debut album. \\"Son of the King\\" showed up on Hammer's debut album Feel My Power (1987), as well as the re-released version Let's Get It Started (1988). With exception to later remixes of early releases, Hammer produced and recorded many rap songs that were never made public, yet are now available on the Internet. Via his record labels such as Bust It Records, Oaktown Records and FullBlast, Hammer has introduced, signed and produced new talent including Oaktown's 3.5.7, Ho Frat Hoo!, the vocal quintet Special Generation, Analise, James Greer, One Cause One Effect, B Angie B, The Stooge Playaz, DASIT (as seen on ego trip's The (White) Rapper Show), Teabag, Common Unity, Geeman and Pleasure Ellis; both collaborating with him and producing music of their own during his career.

Vivien Leigh (born Vivian Mary Hartley, and also known as Lady Olivier after 1947; 5 November 1913 - 8 July 1967) was an English stage and film actress. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress, for her iconic performances as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949. She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of Tovarich (1963). After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). Leigh was born Vivian Mary Hartley on 5 November 1913 in British India on the campus of St. Paul's School, Darjeeling. She was the only child of Ernest Richard Hartley, a British broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (nee Yackjee; she also used her mother's maiden name of Robinson). Her father was born in Scotland in 1882, while her mother, a devout Roman Catholic, was born in Darjeeling in 1888 and was of Irish descent. Gertrude's parents, who lived in India, were Michael John Yackjee (born 1840), a man of independent means, and Mary Teresa Robinson (born 1856), who was born to an Irish family killed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and grew up in an orphanage, where she met Yackjee; they married in 1872 and had five children, of whom Gertrude was the youngest. Ernest and Gertrude Hartley were married in 1912 in Kensington, London. In 1917, Ernest Hartley was transferred to Bangalore as an officer in the Indian Cavalry, while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in Ootacamund. At the age of three, young Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting \\"Little Bo Peep\\". Gertrude Hartley tried to instill an appreciation of literature in her daughter and introduced her to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, as well as stories of Greek mythology and Indian folklore. At the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) then situated in Roehampton, southwest London. One of her friends there was future actress Maureen O'Sullivan, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become \\"a great actress\\". She was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years, she attended schools in Europe, notably in Dinard, Biarritz, San Remo and Paris, becoming fluent in both French and Italian. The family returned to Britain in 1931. She attended A Connecticut Yankee, one of O'Sullivan's films playing in London's West End, and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. Vivian met Herbert Leigh Holman, known as Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in 1931. Despite his disapproval of \\"theatrical people\\", they married on 20 December 1932 and she terminated her studies at RADA, her attendance and interest in acting having already waned after meeting Holman. On 12 October 1933 in London, she gave birth to a daughter, Suzanne, later Mrs. Robin Farrington.

There, the man confronts Luke Fletcher (Donald O'Brien), a sneering crook in the employ of a rich and powerful landowner called Barret. The man tells Fletcher that Barret has swindled him and his son out of money for some non-existent land. The bitter altercation ends with the man shot dead right in front of his son. As the killer laughs sadistically, the little boy picks up his father's gun and shoots Fletcher dead.

Snake tells Roy that many have heard the story of the Silver Saddle, and its owner, the boy who avenged his father. He also knows that Roy Blood seems to leave a trail of dead men in his wake. This is why he wants to tag along: Snake collects items of value from the frequent corpses encountered at every turn in the Wild West.

Step 1: Combine like terms The equation given is 573*t + 674*t - 32400 = 347*t. We can combine the terms with t on the left side of the equation: (573*t + 674*t) - 32400 = 347*t Step 2: Simplify the left side of the equation Adding the coefficients of t together (573 + 674), we get: 1247*t - 32,400 = 347*t Step 3: Subtract 347*t from both sides of the equation To isolate t, we subtract 347*t from both sides of the equation: 1247*t - 347*t - 32,400 + 0 = 347*t - 347*t Step 4: Simplify the equation After subtracting 347*t from both sides of the equation, we get: 900*t - 32,400 = 0 Step 5: Add 32,400 to both sides of the equation Now, we need to isolate t further by adding 32,400 to both sides of the equation: 900*t - 32,400 + 32,400 = 0 + 32,400 Step 6: Simplify the equation After adding 32,400 to both sides of the equation, we get: 900*t = 32,400 Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 900 To completely isolate t, we divide both sides of the equation by 900: (900*t) / 900 = 32,400 / 900 Step 8: Calculate t After dividing both sides by 900, we arrive at the solution for t: t = 36"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her adulterous affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD. These files contain a rambling, meaningless diatribe by Cox on purported CIA activities. When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe the numerical data in the Coxes' bank records, and especially, Cox's diatribes, to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes' home to get more files from their computer.

In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of 11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate.\\" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \\"Roger's criticisms are fair.

Write some highlights for the following article: As Republican presidential candidates move closer to the key tests for their party's nomination, the highly charged topic of Israel and its conflict with Palestinians has come up with increasing frequency in speeches and debates. Most recently, Newt Gingrich sent a jolt through the discussion with his description of Palestinians as \\"an invented\\" people. His rivals, without disagreeing, accused Gingrich of speaking irresponsibly and potentially hurting Israel. Most people in the U.S. and around the world interpret the campaign pledges of love and support for Israel as an effort to win the Jewish vote. But the Jewish vote has little to do with it. The Republican candidates' passionate vows to support Israel have two objectives. First, they aim to capture the pro-Israel vote in a country where the vast majority of people side strongly with Israel and in a party where the most reliable primary voters, conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians, express intense feelings on the subject. Second, they seek to make President Barack Obama look weak on foreign policy with an issue people care about and where the GOP thinks it might score some points. There are many things you can say about how Obama handled the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The one thing you cannot say is that it succeeded. His early missteps managed to make Israelis and Palestinians feel betrayed by Washington. The very public pressure Obama exerted on Israel, has, according to some polls hurt his standing among Jews and among Israelis. But the president's change in tone later helped him with both groups. Most Israelis now say they view him favorably. Among American Jews, Obama's approval may have sunk significantly to the low 50s, but that is still considerably higher than the approval he enjoys nationwide. Despite the views of serious analysts and the calculations of conspiracy theorists, Jewish voters are hardly the point. The numbers confirm that a Republican fight for the Jewish vote would mostly amount to wasted energy. The number of Jewish-American voters barely registers when compared with the size of the pro-Israel vote. Barely 2% of American voters are Jewish compared with more than 60% who consider themselves pro-Israel. Worse for Republicans, a large and consistent majority of Jews vote Democratic. Obama won the Jewish vote by an incredible 78% in the last election. Most American Jews have voted for Democratic presidents for decades. Even if half of them voted for a Republican this year, the prize during the primary is hardly worth the effort. The pro-Israel vote is another matter. Americans support Israel so strongly that for every Jew in the U.S., there are at least 30 non-Jews who say they side with the Jewish state. Support for Israel is at near-record highs, making a pro-Israel position a winning formula for Republicans and Democrats. It's not just Republicans candidates who proclaim their commitment to Israel. Despite his strained relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama frequently asserts support. He expressed that sentiment in June at a Democratic National Committee event, saying that \\"Israel's security will always be at the top tier of considerations ... because it's the right thing to do, because Israel is our closest ally and friend ... it shares our values and it shares our principles.\\" Those are words pro-Israel voters, Jewish or not, want to hear. If Republican candidates were trying to help Israel rather than chasing votes, they might stop using it as a political issue. The most damaging change they can bring to the Jewish state's security is to turn support for Israel into a partisan matter. Until now, it is one of the few issues on which bitterly divided Republicans and Democrats usually agree. In fact, Gingrich's recent comments about Palestinians would not make him a lot of friends among Israelis. His incendiary remark -- that Palestine was never a state and Palestinians identified themselves as Arabs until recently -- does nothing to advance the cause of peace. However long Palestinians have seen themselves as a \\"people,\\" they now share a common history and view themselves as one. The obvious response to Gingrich's rhetorical Molotov cocktail is, so what? Gingrich seemed to imply Palestinians do not deserve a state. But the best conceivable way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is creating two states. That's why a majority of Israelis support the two-state solution. But for now, Republican candidates are worried about rounding up primary votes. One way to do that is by appealing to those with the most intense feelings and the greatest anxiety about Israel's security. More than 60% of conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians, according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, consider it \\"a very important goal\\" to protect Israel. For evangelicals, in particular, the issue could decide their voting choice. That's why Michelle Bachmann, for example, has spoken in almost mystical terms, saying \\"as a nation we have been blessed because of our relationship with Israel.\\" Mitt Romney says his first trip as president will be to Israel. All candidates -- except Ron Paul, who wants to cut all foreign aid -- make support for Israel a cornerstone of their foreign policy. Once the Republicans choose their candidate and the race becomes a two-person contest, both sides will try to show they are the most committed to maintaining the strongest of ties and the greatest commitment to Israel's security. It will be a quest for the backing of Jewish voters, but more importantly, an effort to entice the much larger pool of Americans who consider themselves supporters of Israel.","completion":"As Republican presidential candidates head into key tests for their party's nomination, the topic of Israel and its conflict with Palestinians has increasingly come up in speeches and debates.

Answer the following question: what is the meaning of the nigerian flag?","completion":"The Nigerian flag is a significant symbol that represents the rich and diverse culture, history, and unity of the people in Nigeria, which is the most populous African nation. Designed in 1959 by a Nigerian student named Michael Taiwo Akinkunmi, the flag officially came into use as Nigeria's national symbol on October 1, 1960, when the country gained independence from British colonial rule. The Nigerian flag consists of a horizontal tricolor that features three equally sized vertical bands of green, white, and green. Each color in the flag embodies a specific meaning that relates to different aspects of Nigeria's identity and the aspirations of its people: 1. Green: The two green stripes on Nigeria's flag symbolize the beauty, fertility, and abundant agricultural wealth present in the country. Nigeria is blessed with a diverse and rich environment, featuring diverse climate zones, numerous natural resources, and vast arable land. Agriculture has always been an integral part of Nigerian society, both culturally and economically. The vibrant green color celebrates this fertile aspect of the land and signifies the hope and potential for sustainable development and growth within Nigeria's agrarian sector. Additionally, green is generally considered a color of life, growth, and prosperity, connecting the nation to ecological consciousness and environmental preservation. 2. White: The white stripe in the middle of the Nigerian national flag represents peace, unity, and purity. As a multicultural nation with over 250 ethnic groups and more than 500 languages, Nigeria has experienced internal strife and discord over the years. The white color serves as a powerful reminder of the need to maintain harmony, overcome differences, and work together towards a common goal. By placing the color of peace between the two green stripes, the flag effectively connects both agricultural prosperity and ecological conscience to the essential role of peaceful coexistence. The white stripe accentuates the idea that lasting success and progress can only be achieved through tolerance, understanding, and compassion among Nigeria's diverse peoples. While the Nigerian flag does not feature any specific emblems or textures, its simplicity makes it a potent and easily recognizable symbol for Nigeria. The flag is commonly flown at government buildings, public institutions, and during national events. It also serves as an emblem of pride and patriotism for Nigerian citizens and the Nigerian diaspora. In conclusion, the meaning of the Nigerian flag is deeply intertwined with the country's rich history, cultural diversity, agricultural wealth, and aspirations for peace and unity. Through its tricolor design consisting of green and white, the flag powerfully signifies Nigeria's commitment to developing its agricultural and ecological potential while fostering a sense of solidarity and harmony among its citizens. As a national symbol, the Nigerian flag instills pride and a sense of identity, connecting Nigerians everywhere to the country's unique story and values."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The first question is asking about the possibility of recording a podcast interview using two lapel microphones connected to an iPhone through a splitter, with the intent of achieving separate vocal tracks for each input. The user also asks if they need special software or hardware to accomplish this task. The second question is inquiring about the use of a male-to-2-female audio splitter to connect a headphone and a microphone. While both questions involve the use of audio equipment and splitting devices, the purposes, objectives, and specific details of each scenario are different. In the first question, the goal is to achieve separate vocal recordings for two different inputs (the lapel microphones) on an iPhone, while the second question is specifically asking about the possibility of attaching a headphone and a microphone simultaneously using a single splitter. In regards to the first question, to record separate vocal tracks using two lapel microphones plugged into an iPhone with a splitter, you will possibly need a special app or hardware. Most built-in iOS voice recording apps do not support multitrack recording directly. However, you can use an app like Bossjock Studio or RØDE Reporter, which allows for recording and mixing multiple inputs. You might also want to invest in an external audio interface like the RØDECaster Pro or a mixer that is compatible with your iOS device. For the second question, male-to-2-female audio splitters designed for splitting headphone signals can cause issues when attempting to use them as an input and output splitter. Instead, you should use a dedicated headset splitter with separate headphone and microphone connectors explicitly designed for this purpose, such as the StarTech MUYHSMFF or similar products.

Which entity is this text about? Povenmire was born in San Diego, California on September 18, 1963, and grew up in the city of Mobile, Alabama. A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; by the time he was ten, his work was displayed in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that \\"every drawing he [Jones] did was beautiful to look at and had so much energy in it\\". In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh conceived the series Phineas and Ferb, based on their similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. Povenmire spent 14-16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing \\"It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on.\\" Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: \\"Usually that means they throw it in the trash later,\\" Povenmire recalled. Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, on the condition that he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States. Instead of a conventional script, the pair pitched the pilot by recording reels of its storyboard, which Povenmire then mixed and dubbed to produce action and vocals. The network approved the show for a 26-episode season. Povenmire left Family Guy to create the series. Povenmire and Marsh wanted to incorporate into Phineas and Ferb the kind of humor they had developed in their work on Rocko's Modern Life. They included action sequences and, with Disney's encouragement, featured musical numbers in every episode subsequent to \\"Flop Starz\\". Povenmire described the songs as his and Marsh's \\"jab at immortality\\", but the pair have earned two Emmy nominations for Phineas and Ferb songs to-date. A third Emmy nomination, for the episode \\"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\\" (2008), pitted the show against SpongeBob SquarePants, although neither nominee received the award due to a technicality. In 2010, Povenmire was nominated amongst several other Phineas and Ferb crew members for the Daytime Emmy Award for both \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\" and \\"Outstanding Original Song - Children's and Animation\\" for their work on the show, winning for \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\". The distinctive style of the animation legend Tex Avery influenced the show's artistic look. Like Avery, Povermire employed geometric shapes to build both the characters and the background. The style developed almost accidentally, with Povenmire's first sketch of title character, Phineas Flynn, which he produced while eating dinner with his family in a restaurant in South Pasadena, California. He doodled a triangle-shaped child on the butcher paper covering the table. He was so taken with sketch he tore it out, kept it, and used it as the prototype for Phineas and as the stylistic blueprint for the entire show.","completion":"This text is about Dan Povenmire, an animator and creator of the animated television series Phineas and Ferb, along with Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh.

Input: Psychotherapist Hal Raglan runs the Somafree Institute where he performs a technique called \\"psychoplasmics\\", encouraging patients with mental disturbances to let go of their suppressed emotions through physiological changes to their bodies. One of his patients is Nola Carveth, a severely disturbed woman who is legally embattled with her husband Frank for custody of their five-year-old daughter Candice. When Frank discovers bruises and scratches on Candice following a visit with Nola, he informs Raglan of his intent to stop visitation rights. Wanting to protect his patient, Raglan begins to intensify the sessions with Nola to resolve the issue quickly. During the therapy sessions, Raglan discovers that Nola was physically and verbally abused by her self-pitying alcoholic mother, and neglected by her co-dependent alcoholic father, who refused to protect Nola out of shame and denial. Meanwhile, Frank, intending to invalidate Raglan's methods, questions Jan Hartog, a former Somafree patient dying of psychoplasmic-induced lymphoma.Frank leaves Candice with her grandmother Juliana, and the two spend the evening viewing old photographs; Juliana informs Candice that Nola was frequently hospitalized as a child, and often exhibited strange unexplained wheals on her skin that doctors were unable to diagnose. While returning to the kitchen, Juliana is attacked and bludgeoned to death by a small, dwarf-like child. Candice is traumatized, but otherwise unharmed.Juliana's estranged husband Barton returns for the funeral, and attempts to contact Nola at Somafree, but Raglan turns him away. Frank invites his daughter's teacher Ruth Mayer home for dinner to discuss Candice, but Barton interrupts with a drunken phone call from Juliana's home, demanding that they both go to Somafree in force to see Nola. Frank leaves to console Barton, leaving Candice in Ruth's care. While he is away, Ruth accidentally answers a phone call from Nola, who, recognizing her voice, insults her and angrily warns her to stay away from her family. Frank arrives to find Barton murdered by the same deformed dwarf-child, who dies after attempting to kill Frank.The police autopsy reveals a multitude of bizarre anatomical anomalies: the creature is asexual, supposedly color-blind, naturally toothless, and devoid of a navel, indicating no known means of natural human birth. After the murder story reaches the newspapers, Raglan reluctantly acknowledges that the murders coincide with the sessions relating to their respective topics. He closes Somafree and sends his patients to municipal care with the exception of Nola.When Candice returns to school, two dwarf children attack and kill Ruth in front of her class, and abscond with Candice to Somafree. Frank is alerted of the closure of Somafree by Hartog. Mike, one of the patients forced to leave the institute tells Frank that Nola is Raglan's \\"queen bee\\" and in charge of some \\"disturbed children\\" in a property work shed.

Raglan tells him the truth about the dwarf children: they are the accidental product of Nola's psychoplasmic sessions; Nola's rage about her abuse was so strong that she parthenogenetically bore a brood of children who psychically respond and act on the targets of her rage with Nola completely unaware of their actions. Realizing the brood are too dangerous to keep anymore, Raglan plots to venture into their quarters and rescue Candice, provided that Frank can keep Nola calm to avoid provoking the children.Frank attempts a feigned rapprochement long enough for Raglan to collect Candice, but when he witnesses Nola give birth to another child through a psychoplasmically-induced external womb, she notices his disgust. The brood awakens and kills Raglan. Nola then threatens to kill Candice rather than lose her. The brood goes after her, Candice hides in a closet, but the brood begins to break through the door and try to grab Candice. In desperation, Frank chokes Nola to death, and the brood dies without its mother's psychic connection.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What's the most logical way to complete this passage? Some things you just know for a fact. First U.S. president: George Washington. First human to walk on the moon: Neil Armstrong. First to achieve powered flight: Orville and Wilbur Wright. Wrong. At least that's what Connecticut says. State lawmakers passed a bill this week to honor Gustave Whitehead, who they claim beat the Wrights by two years. Gustave who? Whitehead. According to a 1901 Connecticut newspaper account, Whitehead -- a German immigrant -- flew his aircraft 150 feet in the air for about a half mile over the city of Bridgeport. The claim has been backed up by a respected aviation reference guide. Crouch says the family \\"stuck one clause into that contract that said if the Smithsonian ever says anybody flew before the","completion":"Wrights, they have to give the airplane back.\\" The situation has led some to believe that the Smithsonian is hesitant to acknowledge Whitehead's achievements due to this contract and the potential loss of a significant historical artifact. However, the debate over who achieved powered flight first continues to rage on. The Smithsonian Institution, which has long upheld the Wright brothers' 1903 flight as the first successful powered flight, has defended this claim, citing a lack of solid evidence supporting Whitehead's achievements. The Ohio-based National Aviation Heritage Alliance stands behind the Smithsonian's stance, asserting that there is insufficient historical documentation to prove Whitehead's powered flight took place before the one made by the Wright brothers. Conversely, supporters of Whitehead's claim argue that the Connecticut newspaper account should be taken at face value, since it was published during a time when journalism was more focused on reporting actual events rather than sensationalism. They assert that the eye-witness accounts should be strongly considered as valid evidence of Whitehead's flight. Further fueling this argument is the recent discovery of a photograph believed to depict Whitehead's aircraft in flight, although its legitimacy has yet to be definitively proven. The debate over the true pioneers of powered flight remains contentious due to the high stakes at play. Recognizing Gustave Whitehead as the first to achieve powered flight would not only give credit where credit is due but would also alter the narrative of aviation history. As a result, the families of the Wright brothers, aviation historians, and institutions with vested interests in the traditional historical account are reluctant to accept Whitehead's achievements without irrefutable evidence. To summarize, the most logical way to complete this passage focuses on detailing the ongoing debate surrounding Gustave Whitehead's claim to be the first to achieve powered flight. A fair assessment must take into account the various viewpoints, interests, and pieces of evidence presented by each side, including the claims that the Smithsonian may be biased due to its contract with the Wright family, the lack of comprehensive documentation for Whitehead's flight, and the added complexities brought to the debate by recently discovered photographs. Until definitive evidence emerges and a consensus is reached, the question of who truly achieved the first powered flight will remain a point of contention among aviation enthusiasts and historians alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Noah Syndergaard sums up the Mets' heartbreaking loss to the Giants in one tweet Noah Syndergaard was unbelievable for the New York Mets in the National League Wild Card Game Wednesday night at Citi Field. In a one-game playoff against the San Francisco Giants, with the winner moving on to the NLDS to face the Chicago Cubs, Syndergaard pitched seven shutout innings, allowing two hits, walking three and striking out 10. He didn't allow a baserunner until the fourth inning nor a hit until the sixth. His stuff was so dominant that this sums it up perfectly: Noah Syndergaard threw 42 pitches 98+ mph tonight. That's more than the Phillies (41) and Indians (35) threw all year. #Thor After the game, Mets manager Terry Collins raved about his starter, saying it likely was the best game of his career. \\"I've got to rank this one tonight as good as any, under the circumstances,\\" Collins said. \\"Great command. I mean, focused like he always is. I tell you, he stepped up when we needed him. He stepped up last year when we needed him. He's grown so much, even though he's still very, very young. He's grown so much and matured so much as a pitcher. He's going to be really, really good.\\" That's all good, and yet it does nothing to mask the pain of coming out after seven innings and then watching the Giants' Conor Gillaspie hit a three-run homer in the top of the ninth, which would hold up in a 3-0 victory for San Francisco. The cameras panned to Syndergaard in the dugout and he was stunned. Well after the game, past 1 a.m. ET in New York, Syndergaard posted this tweet that perfectly sums up baseball.

Question: Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled. Question: suppose the lungs are functioning correctly happens, how will it affect the lungs will oxygenate less blood. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If the lungs are not functioning correctly, it will result in decreased oxygenation of the blood. The perturbation of proper lung function can have significant effects on the second effect mentioned, which is the filtering out of carbon dioxide by every cell in the body. Under normal circumstances, the lungs efficiently oxygenate the blood, and the oxygen-rich blood is carried throughout the body to deliver oxygen to the cells. The cells use oxygen to produce energy through cellular respiration and release carbon dioxide as a waste product. Carbon dioxide then binds to hemoglobin, forming carbaminohemoglobin, and is transported back to the lungs via the bloodstream, where it is exhaled. In the case of the lungs functioning incorrectly, the oxygenation of the blood will be lessened. As a result, there will be a reduced amount of oxygen available for the cells to perform cellular respiration. This can lead to a decreased production of energy within the cells, affecting their ability to perform essential functions and maintain overall health. Additionally, a lower level of oxygen in the blood may affect the rate at which carbon dioxide can be transported back to the lungs. The reduced oxygen concentration can alter the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, leading to less efficient binding and transportation of carbon dioxide. Consequently, carbon dioxide may accumulate in the bloodstream, resulting in a condition called hypercapnia. Hypercapnia can impair cellular function and negatively impact the acid-base balance in the body, leading to further complications. In summary, the supposed perturbation caused by the lungs functioning incorrectly will have a considerable effect on the second effect mentioned, the filtering out of carbon dioxide by every cell in the body. The reduced oxygenation of the blood can lead to less efficient cellular respiration, energy production, and potential accumulation of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whole families were pressed up against the railings at Largo Argentina, the square in Rome, craning their heads toward ... a hole in the ground. Rome is full of holes in the ground, many of them historically significant, but this one was extra special. It contained the remains of the theater and temple where Julius Caesar was assassinated. But the kids weren't there for the ancient general-turned-emperor, murdered by treacherous senators in 44 BC. They were there for the cats. Rome's kitty ruins. Rome's noble ruins are a favorite haunt of feral cats. The \\"gatti di Roma\\" star on postcards and wall calendars sold all over the city. The ruins at Largo Argentina host an open-air cat sanctuary that's more than just a good show for visiting and local children. The city's strays have been fed and watered at the site almost since it was first excavated in the 1920s. The 1990s brought an injection of funds into the Torre Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary, money that allowed more cats to be trapped, neutered and returned to their colony. Now, thousands of sterilizations are carried out each year -- around 30,000 and counting since 2000. More: How to Travel with Your Dog. Japan's cat islands. That's right: islands. Plural. Tashirojima in Miyagi Prefecture, is Japan's best-known feline isle. It usually goes by the name Cat Island. Dogs have been barred from Tashirojima for as long as anyone can remember. The island's cats vastly outnumber its human population. Tashirojima's furry inhabitants are well cared for by local fishermen, who hope to ensure a good catch by leaving offerings at a cat shrine. The island's most prominent structure, the Manga building and campsite, is embellished with a pair of pointy ears, in tribute to the island's lucky charms. Japan's other cat island, Ainoshima, is a little more remote, a 20-minute ferry ride from Shingu port in Fukuoka. A scrum of happy cats hangs out by the port, waiting for the next fishing boat or ferry to dock. In fact, the island represents a doubly incentive for the cats -- rugged Ainoshima is also a popular birdwatching site. More: The cat that saved a Japanese train station. Houtong, Taiwan.

The Houtong Coal Mine Ecological Park (Houtong Road, Ruifang District, New Taipei City; +886 2 2497 4143) was established to showcase the mining heritage of the town and surrounding hills. But visitors mostly come to photograph the 120 or so playful cats, who laze around the Cat Village and soak up the fuss -- and inevitable treats.

Precocious and virtuoso are just two of the words used to describe the 22-year-old playmaker ahead of Colombia’s World Cup quarter final against Brazil on Friday. Just 22, he is already Colombia’s top scorer at a World Cup and is the leading scorer so far at the 2014 tournament. For many, the player who wears the name James (pronounced 'Hamez') on his jersey has been a revelation at the World Cup. VIDEO Scroll down to watch James Rodriguez's silky skills. Star in the making: Colombia's No 10 has taken the World Cup by storm with five goals in four games. Trust: Playmaker James Rodriguez (right) talks to head coach Jose Pekerman. But for those who have followed his football career, there has been no surprise. They knew that he was talented, had a winning mentality and could give Colombians something they have been awaiting for a long time. He has been consolidating himself as the replacement of Carlos 'el Pibe' Valderrama, the leading figure of a national team that played in three World Cups in the 1990s. Faustino Asprilla, an ex-Colombia player from that generation, said that Rodriguez 'can be the best Colombian footballer in history.' His technical abilities have been exceptional and he has shown them off in Brazil. He scores with surprising ease. He has scored in each of Colombia’s matches, and he has done it with both feet and his head. Focused: Colombia's James Rodriguez shows off his juggling skills during training on Thursday. Wonderstrike: Rodriguez thumps a volley past Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera in the round of 16. In Colombia’s 2-0 win over Uruguay, he controlled the ball with his chest and shot from outside the area to score one the most stunning goals of the tournament. 'Football needs players of his characteristics for this spectacle,' Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez said. 'For the moment, he’s the best player at this World Cup. Despite his nickname, 'el Nino' arrived in Brazil with the curriculum of a veteran: eight years playing as a professional in Colombia, Argentina, Portugal and France. His professional debut came when he was 15 for Colombian team Envigado. Prepared: Rodriguez stretches during a training session in Fortaleza, Brazil. Rodriguez also became the youngest foreign player to debut, score and become a champion in Argentina, where his performances were a springboard for a move to Europe. In 2010, he moved to Porto, where he shared a dressing room with fellow Colombia team-mates Radamel Falcao, Fredy Guarin and, later on, Jackson Martinez. In Portugal, he won three league titles and the Europa League before signing with Monaco, which paid 45 million euros for his transfer last season. In Portugal, aged just 19, he married Daniela Ospina, the sister of Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. A devout Christian, Rodriguez goes to church, as does Falcao and other members of the Colombia squad. The faith seems to be a uniting element of the team, which usually gathers in a circle on the pitch and prays before matches. Team spirit: Rodriguez and his team-mates celebrate with a dance after his goal against Ivory Coast. Book mark: Colombia coach Jose Pekerman talks tactics with Carlos Sanchez. Star man: Pekerman has built his exciting Colombian side around Rodriguez. On social media sites, Rodriguez refers to himself in profiles as a 'son of God.' Usually shy and a man of few words, he got over a mild stuttering problem during his childhood. He is the son of an ex-footballer who left the family when Rodriguez was 3. It was his step-father who took Rodriguez to a football school when he was 5 and where he usually played with boys who were advanced. 'That boy played every match as if it were the last one he would play in his life,' said Armando Calderon, coach of the Tolimense Football Academy where Rodriguez played as a youth before turning professional with Envigado. 'James doesn’t accept losing, not even in PlayStation,' his mother, Pilar Rubio, said. From Envigado, he went to play for Banfield in Argentina when he was 16.

At Monaco, the young playmaker was reunited with Falcao, whose serious knee injury in January meant Rodriguez assumed more goal-scoring responsibilities in the final months of the season. He finished the season with 10 goals and 13 assists. Rodriguez soon extinguished any fears that without 'El Tigre,' Colombia wouldn’t be able to find its way to goal. 'His growth is permanent, mature,' Colombia coach Jose Pekerman said. 'He has a vision for the game, a good shot.' Rodriguez’s feats are transcending football, and comments about his talent are all over social media. 'Man watching this Colombian game I think I have my fav player in the world cup!' NBA player LeBron James said. 'Obviously his name help that out.'

Summarize: Diabetes UK says that up to 80% of foot amputations could be avoided if better care was in place. Patients are suffering because many areas do not have services in place to quickly deal with foot ulcers and infections. By 2015, the number of diabetes-related amputations is expected to rise to 7,000 a year. When diabetes, both Types 1 and Type 2, is present for many years, especially if it is poorly controlled, it can cause complications such as reducing blood flow to vessels in the feet and nerve damage which reduces sensation. This increases the risk of ulcers and infections that may lead to amputation. A report produced in collaboration with the Society for Chiropodists and Podiatrists and NHS Diabetes points out that people with diabetes are more than 20 times more likely to have an amputation than the rest of the population. It recommends that all hospitals have a multi-disciplinary footcare team as recommended in national guidelines. Figures suggest that 40% of hospitals currently do not have such teams in place. Every hospital also needs to be able to guarantee that people with urgent foot problems can be assessed by the right professionals within 24 hours, the report urges. This is because ulcers can deteriorate extremely quickly and a matter of hours can make the difference between keeping a foot and losing it. In addition people with diabetes who are at high risk for foot problems need to know what to look out for and what to do when a problem develops. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said it is unacceptable that every week people with diabetes who have treatable foot problems are having feet or toes amputated because they are not being treated quickly enough. \\"It is not as if this is a problem we don't know how to solve. \\"If every hospital had a multi-disciplinary footcare team and ensured access to that team within 24 hours, then that would make a huge difference to the amputation rates.\\" She added that some prevention work was so poor that people were not even asked to take their shoes off when attending their annual foot check. \\"This is not something that requires more money,\\" she continued. \\"In fact, putting these kind of systems in place can actually save money because the amputations that they prevent are so expensive. Matthew Fitzpatrick, spokesman for the College of Podiatry, said they strongly welcomed the recommendations. \\"The most important aspect is that patients appreciate how to check themselves and are seeking appropriate advice when they need it. \\"If they're worried then their local podiatrist should be the first port of call.\\" Summary:","completion":"Diabetes UK, an organization that helps people with diabetes, says that a lot of surgeries to remove feet could be avoided if hospitals take better care of people. Right now, there aren't enough services to quickly help with sores and infections on feet caused by diabetes. Because diabetes can make it hard for blood to get to the vessels in the feet, it makes it easier for these sores and infections to happen and they can sometimes lead to a surgery to remove the foot. The report, supported by three organizations, advises that hospitals should have special teams to take care of feet, and people with urgent foot problems should be seen by professionals within a day. The report also says patients with diabetes should know how to check their feet for signs of sores and infections. The CEO of Diabetes UK also said that it's important for people with diabetes to receive treatment quickly to avoid unnecessary surgeries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Scientists added a record of 715 more planets to the list known to the world beyond the solar system, astronomers said on Wednesday, in February 2014. The additions include four planets about 0.5-2 times as big as Earth that are the right distance from their parent stars for liquid surface water, which is believed to be fit for life. The discoveries were made with the NASA's planet-hunting Kepler space telescope. The telescope, launched in 2009, spent four productive years observing 160,000 target stars for signs of planets passing by, within the telescope's sight. The numbers of planets announced at a NASA press conference on Wednesday increased Kepler's confirmed planets from 246 to 961. Combined with other telescopes' results, the total number of planets beyond the solar system now is nearly 1,700. \\"We almost doubled, just today, the number of planets known to humans,\\" astronomer Douglas Hudgins, head of planet exploration at NASA Headquarters in Washington, told reporters on a conference call. Many planets' discovery is due to a new technique that analyzes potential planets in _ rather than one at a time. The method was developed after scientists realized that most planets, like those in the solar system, have similar worlds orbiting a common parent star. The newly found planets strengthen the evidence that small planets, two to three times the size of Earth, are common throughout the galaxy . \\"Generally, wherever (Kepler) can see them, it finds them,\\" said astronomer Sara Seager, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \\"That's why we have confidence that there will be planets like Earth in outer space.\\" Like the solar system, which has eight planets plus Pluto and other so-called \\"dwarf planets,\\" the newly found planets belong to families.

Socialite Ching (Angelica Lee), who also attended the party, identified Ling (Karena Lam) as the prime suspect because she found out that Ling was the only stranger presented in the ball room.

During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed. Ling was released uncharged due to insufficient evidence as police believed Ching could be framing her for cheating with her boyfriend. Rather than quickly disappear, Ling starts stalking Ching, apparently jealous that Ching could have everything Ling wanted without an effort while Ling has to fight for it. Ching, at the beginning, sees that as a form of harassment, but soon twists it around and follows Ling instead. Ling seems accepting of this, showing her the darker side of life living as a poor girl compared to Ching's rich-girl background.

Q:The answer to the question: Who does the visitor attempt to take after the knitting woman? is inside the article: Brink has recently taken Pud's (Bobs Watson) parents in an auto wreck. Brink later comes for Gramps. Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the crotchety old Gramps orders Mr. Brink off the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or apparition. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can. Pud's busybody Aunt Demetria has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spends much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy. Brink takes Granny Nellie in a peaceful death just after she finishes a bit of knitting. When Mr. Brink returns again for Gramps, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is.

Its spiral arms wind in both directions, which makes it nearly impossible for astronomers to determine the rotation of the galaxy. Astronomers theorize that a galaxy merger with a smaller companion galaxy near the core of the main galaxy could have led to the unusual spiral structure. NGC 5253, a peculiar irregular galaxy, is located near the border with Hydra and Messier 83, with which it likely had a close gravitational interaction 1-2 billion years ago. This may have sparked the galaxys high rate of star formation, which continues today and contributes to its high surface brightness. NGC 5253 includes a large nebula and at least 12 large star clusters. In the eyepiece, it is a small galaxy of magnitude 10 with dimensions of 5 arcminutes by 2 arcminutes and a bright nucleus. NGC 4945 is a spiral galaxy seen edge-on from Earth, 13 million light-years away. It is visible with any amateur telescope, as well as binoculars under good conditions; it has been described as \\"shaped like a candle flame\\", being long and thin (16 by 3). In the eyepiece of a large telescope, its southeastern dust lane becomes visible. Another galaxy is NGC 5102, found by star-hopping from Iota Centauri. In the eyepiece, it appears as an elliptical object 9 arcminutes by 2.5 arcminutes tilted on a southwest-northeast axis. Answer this question: How many more light-years away is NGC 4622 than NGC 4945?","completion":"Imagine a light-year is like a really long ruler, and it helps us measure how far away things are in space. NGC 4622 is 200 million light-years away, and NGC 4945 is 13 million light-years away. Now, let's use subtraction like taking away cookies from a jar. If we take away the 13 million light-years from the 200 million light-years, we get 187 million light-years.

Here is an article: Outbursts of panic gripped several Paris neighbourhoods Sunday where vigils were being held in the wake of this weekend's suicide attacks, but they were false alarms, French law enforcement officials said. A crowd at Place de la République apparently panicked after hearing firecrackers, one of the officials said. Someone reached out to police in the plaza out of fear, and when officers arrived with weapons drawn, the spooked crowd scurried, a security official said. CBC's Thomas Daigle, reporting from the French capital, said calm was soon restored. Vigils and church services were being held for victims of Friday night's attacks, which left 129 dead and more than 300 wounded following in a series of co-ordinated assaults on restaurants, a concert venue and a soccer stadium. A man carries two children after panic broke out among mourners paying their respects at the attack sites at restaurant Le Petit Cambodge and the Carillon Hotel in Paris, Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015. (Peter Dejong/Associated Press) Close to Place de la République, panic broke out near a small Cambodian restaurant and a bar that were the scenes of shooting on Friday night. Police were seen running with guns drawn, but a security official said there were no confirmed threats to the area. The security officials weren't authorized to be publicly named, in accordance with government policy. Earlier, French authorities said they have formally identified one of the suicide attackers who tried to storm the Stade de France, the country's national stadium, as well as another man who attacked a restaurant in central Paris. One of the men was 20 and the other was 31. Both were French nationals living in Belgium. A third man, who died in the assault on the Bataclan concert hall, was identified earlier as 29-year-old Ismael Mostefai, a Frenchman with known ties to Islamic radicalism. The 29-year old, from Courcouronnes, south of Paris, was identified from a severed finger found at the concert hall. Mostefai was one of the attackers who detonated suicide belts there. Initially silent after the ordeal, survivors who endured two hours of being held hostage at the concert hall — where 89 of the victims were slain — have started sharing their memories. People had to go through security at all six entrances to Notre Dame Cathedral for Sunday's special mass to pay tribute to victims of the Paris attacks. (Jessica Rubinger/CBC ) A French survivor of the rampage said Sunday that he was struck by how young the gunmen were. Julien Pearce, a journalist at Europe 1 radio, was at the Bataclan on Friday night to attend the concert by the U.S. rock band Eagles of Death Metal. He said when the three attackers stormed in, \\"it took me few seconds to realize it was gunshots.\\" Pearce and his friends immediately got down on the ground to avoid the random shots, then ran and crawled into a tiny dark room next to the stage. \\"There was no exit, so we were just in another trap, less exposed, but still a trap,\\" he said. Pearce said he could discreetly look out and see one of the assailants. \\"He seemed very young,\\" he said. \\"That's what struck me — his childish face, very determined, cold, calm, frightening.\\" Once the attackers reloaded, Pearce said, his group ran across the stage to an emergency exit, helping a wounded woman out. Looking back, he saw \\"dozens and dozens of entangled, bullet-riddled bodies in a pool of blood.\\" A couple contemplates the growing memorial of flowers and candles near Le Carillon, one of the restaurants attacked. (Nahlah Ayed/CBC) Minutes before and eight blocks away, gunmen began firing into the Petit Cambodge restaurant, where a 24-year-old man from Britain said he remembers shards of glass flying past his head. The man told The Independent on Sunday he and others dropped to the floor. He ended up lying next to a woman who had been shot in the chest. More than 100 bullet cartridges were found throughout the restaurant. Around the corner, British-Danish psychotherapist Mark Colclough told reporters he was with a colleague on de la Fontaine-au-Roi Street when he saw a gunman dressed all in black fire at the Bonne Bière café before targeting a pizzeria called Casa Nostra across the street. He described the gunman swivelling left and right as he opened fire first on the window of a car and then patrons of the two establishments. A Belgian official said Sunday that seven people have been detained in Belgium as part of the investigation into the massacre. The official told The Associated Press that two of the seven attackers were French men living in Brussels. As the investigation continued, an unidentified French police official was quoted as saying three Kalashnikov assault rifles were found inside a car used in the attacks. There was a heavy police presence at Notre Dame Cathedral, where a mass was to be held for victims. Two cars are known to have been used in the attacks: a Volkswagen Polo parked at the Bataclan concert hall and a Seat, a Spanish-made vehicle, where the arms were found. The Seat appeared to be have been involved in the carnage at Paris bars and restaurants, and was found in the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil on Sunday. In addition, French police have issued a photo and wanted notice in their search for a suspect at large. The notice, released Sunday evening, is for Salah Abdeslam, a 26-year-old man born in Brussels. It warns people who see him that he is dangerous, saying \\"do not intervene yourself.\\" About 3,000 French troops were in the streets of Paris on Sunday, in part to try to make the city's residents feel safe. Museums and theatres remained closed for a second day. Notre Dame Cathedral was closed to tourists, but open to church-goers wishing to attend services. The famous cathedral held an evening mass for attack victims. \\"Off to the side, dozens of police stand at the ready in bulletproof vests,\\" CBC's Nahlah Ayed reported. A police official said the heavy security was because the tourist attraction is a \\"sensitive site.\\" Everyone using the church's six entrances had to go through a security check. The bells of the 670-year-old church rang out 15 minutes before the service in a special homage to the victims. Streets, parks and stores were unusually empty for such a mild, clear day, and several city monuments were closed because of security reasons or to express their grief. Some Parisians and tourists defied the high security, walking past heavily armed soldiers in body armour to take pictures beneath the Eiffel Tower.

Question: Article: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog. Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation. \\"The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,\\" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery. The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are \\"extremely difficult, if not impossible\\" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said. The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face. The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants, Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue. Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers. Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant.

A family whose 13-year-old daughter was fatally hit by a car as she crossed the road to her school bus four years ago has been awarded 90 million in a wrongful death suit. Ashley Davis was hit by a car as she crossed Brinkley Road in Prince George's County, Maryland on September 1, 2009 - as her classmates looked on - and died in hospital two weeks later. Her parents claimed the school system failed to provide a bus stop on her side of the road, forcing her to cross the street - and failing to fulfill their promise to provide safe transportation to school. Loss: Ashley Davis, 13, was killed as she walked across the road to catch the school bus in 2009. After hitting Ashley, the car, a Lincoln Continental, struck a minivan and a 17-year-old boy, who was hospitalized but survived. John Costello, a lawyer for the family, told NBC Washington that the Prince George's County. School Board was 'negligent' towards Ashley. 'They had adopted a policy to. provide for safe transportation,' he explained. 'The policy was they were going to pick. up Ashley on her own side of the street. They never did. They forced her. to cross the street. She got killed crossing the street.' Her mother, Nycole Davis, spoke about her enduring grief. 'She was on her way,' she said. 'She was doing the right thing. She was going to. school. She was a good girl. She didn’t deserve this. If she didn't have to cross the street... she’d be graduating this year. She'd be going to prom this year.' Loss: Ashley, a high school freshman, suffered serious injuries in the crash and died two weeks later. Scene: She died as she was crossing this road outside her home; her family argued that the school had failed to pick her up on the correct side of the road - thus failing to safely transport her to school. Ashley was forced to walk over the. road to her bus after an original bus repeatedly failed to stop at the. right place, Costello said. The school board failed to provide a. safe bus stop for students who lived on the north side of the road,. according to court documents. At the end of the civil trial, the jury awarded the family 90 million plus medical expenses and funeral costs - one of the largest the county has ever seen, the Washington Post reported. 'The jury was upset that [the school board's] policy was not followed. for a full week and a little girl in her first year of high school ended. up suffering the consequences,' Costello said of the verdict. But lawyers warned the battle was not yet over. Ruling: A George's County Circuit Court jury awarded the family 90m but it will likely be appealed. NBC reported that often a verdict is capped around 100,000 when there is a lawsuit against a municipality. or school system, and Costello expected the board will appeal the verdict. Prince George's County Public Schools said: 'No judgment has been entered in this case. It is still under litigation.' But Ashley's mother said she did not care for the money. 'I didn't ask anyone to give me any money or anything like that,' she said. 'I just want someone held responsible for what happened to my daughter.' She added that her daughter was outgoing and popular, and enjoyed shopping, dancing and writing poetry.","completion":"This story is about a family whose 13-year-old daughter, Ashley Davis, was sadly hit by a car and died while crossing the road to get to her school bus.

These aircraft require advanced targeting systems and maneuverability to ensure high accuracy and minimal collateral damage to friendly troops and infrastructure. The primary purpose of the precision strike aircraft is to support friendly ground forces by attacking and suppressing enemy surface targets, such as vehicles, artillery, and infantry positions. They are also capable of engaging other tactical targets, such as communications infrastructure and command and control centers. Their deployment at the front lines allows them to react quickly to the rapidly changing conditions of a battle and to provide continuous support to ground troops. Several aircraft types are currently being used by the USAF for precision strike missions. These include: 1. A-10 Thunderbolt II: The A-10, commonly known as the \\"Warthog,\\" is specifically designed for close air support. Its heavy armor and powerful GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm rotary cannon make it highly effective at engaging and destroying heavily armored enemy vehicles, such as tanks and fortifications. The A-10 is also equipped with precision-guided munitions, like the AGM-65 Maverick and GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bomb, for engaging lighter targets and minimizing collateral damage. 2. F-15E Strike Eagle: The F-15E is a dual-role fighter that can perform both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. Although it is primarily employed as a strike aircraft, it can also provide close air support. The Strike Eagle is equipped with various targeting pods, which enable it to accurately engage ground targets with a range of precision-guided munitions, such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB). 3. F-16 Fighting Falcon: The F-16 is a multirole fighter that can perform both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. In its ground attack role, the F-16 can be equipped with precision-guided munitions and targeting pods, making it a versatile platform for close air support. Its agility allows it to react quickly to changing battlefield conditions and minimize the time spent in enemy airspace. 4. F-35 Lightning II: The F-35 is a fifth-generation multirole fighter and the newest addition to the USAF's inventory. Its stealth capabilities, advanced sensor suite, and plethora of precision-guided munitions enable it to perform close air support missions with high accuracy while remaining undetected by enemy air defense systems. These precision strike aircraft are usually deployed at the front lines of a battle, where they can provide close air support in coordination with ground forces. Their tactical role focuses on eliminating immediate threats to friendly troops, allowing them to advance and capture objectives. The precision strike aircraft of the USAF are a valuable asset in ensuring battlefield success and in safeguarding the lives of U.S. ground forces during combat operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Depending on the program, it just might change your view of the world for the better. Science has shown that exposure to certain programs can make a huge impression, especially if you've had limited exposure to a particular group in the past. This latest study presented to the Society for Personality and Social Psychology found a nationally representative sample of people who watched some episodes of a show called \\"Little Mosque on the Prairie\\" had less prejudice toward Muslims and Arabs after watching the show. This sitcom depicts life in a new mosque in small-town Canada. The characters are positive and fight over issues common in many spiritual communities: what dish to cook for a big celebration or what role women should play in the service. While the group experiences prejudice from airport security and from a radio host in the town, the characters handle the experiences with good humor and the joke is on those who are prejudiced.A new study found people who watched a sitcom with positive depictions of Muslims had less bias after watching the showWhen tested several weeks later, the attitudes toward Muslims improved Question:\\"So many people don't know any _, and here they are introduced to their community by their TV set.

Is the question \\"What 's the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle ?\\" asking about an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric entity?","completion":"The question \\"What's the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle?\\" is asking about a description of a specific location, which is associated with a number of mysterious incidents and unexplained phenomena. To provide a detailed answer on this topic, we delve into the background, geographic details, popular theories, and scientific explanations related to the Bermuda Triangle. The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is an area in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean that is roughly defined by its three vertices: Miami, Florida; Bermuda; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. It covers an area of around 440,000 square miles of ocean. Since the early 20th century, the region has been surrounded by mystique due to the unexplained disappearance of ships and aircraft, many without a trace. These incidents have given rise to various theories, some supernatural and others scientifically plausible, providing a range of possible explanations for the occurrences in the Bermuda Triangle. Some of the popular supernatural theories include: 1. Paranormal or extraterrestrial activity: Some speculate that the disappearances within the Bermuda Triangle are due to encounters with otherworldly beings or aliens. 2. The lost city of Atlantis: The legend of the mythical city of Atlantis has fueled theories that its powerful energy sources may interfere with ships and aircraft within the Triangle. However, while such theories can be intriguing, many scientists and researchers refute these supernatural explanations and present more plausible explanations: 1. Human error and navigational challenges: One of the most logical explanations is human error in navigation or operations, leading to accidents or vessel loss. The area is heavily traveled, increasing the probability of accidents. 2. Weather phenomena: The region can experience frequent hurricanes, tropical storms, and other severe weather conditions that can endanger or sink vessels. Waterspouts and rogue waves can also contribute to disasters at sea. 3. Compass variations: The Bermuda Triangle has been known to exhibit local magnetic anomalies, which can cause compass deviations. This might lead to navigational issues, as compass misreadings could send ships and planes off course. 4. Oceanic methane hydrates: Methane hydrates are present in some parts of the ocean floor. In the event of their gas release, water density would decrease, causing a ship to lose its buoyancy and sink rapidly. However, this explanation is still under debate and has not been conclusively proven. 5. The Gulf Stream: The Gulf Stream, a powerful and fast-moving ocean current, passes through the Bermuda Triangle. This current can rapidly sweep away debris and wreckage from incidents, leaving behind no trace of the accidents. In conclusion, the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle refers to a specific location where unexplained disappearances of ships and aircraft have fueled various supernatural and scientific theories. While supernatural explanations captivate the imagination, scientific theories such as human error, weather phenomena, and compass variations are more plausible and offer a more grounded perspective on the incidents within the Bermuda Triangle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given these facts, what happens with the formation of the embryo among the following options: - Plants growth - Plant reproduction - oxidation reaction - cancer - sex - cell death - It expands - fertilization The answer to this question is:","completion":"Plant reproduction. The formation of an embryo is a crucial step in the process of plant reproduction. When fertilization occurs, the sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote, and this single-celled structure eventually develops into a multicellular embryo. The embryo is surrounded by a protective seed coat and contains the genetic information necessary for the growth and development of a new plant. In more detail, plant reproduction can be classified into two types: sexual and asexual reproduction. During sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of haploid cells from the male and female reproductive structures, the formation of an embryo plays a pivotal role. Here is an outline of the process: 1. Pollination: Pollen grains, containing the male gametes (sperm cells), are transferred from the anther (male reproductive structure) to the stigma (female reproductive structure) of a flower, either through self-pollination or cross-pollination. 2. Fertilization: A pollen tube grows from the pollen grain through the style and into the ovary. The sperm cells travel down the pollen tube, and one of them fuses with the egg cell in the ovule (located inside the ovary), leading to fertilization. 3. Embryo formation: Upon fertilization, the zygote forms and begins to divide, eventually developing into an embryo. The embryo contains a shoot apical meristem, which will give rise to the aerial parts of the plant, and a radicle, which will develop into the plant's root system. Additionally, it contains one or two cotyledons (seed leaves) that serve as the initial food source for the developing seedling. 4. Seed development: The ovule, containing the embryo, transforms into a seed. The outer layer of the ovule becomes the seed coat, which provides protection and helps to prevent germination in unfavorable conditions. 5. Dispersal and germination: Seeds are dispersed by various mechanisms, such as wind, water, or animals, and find suitable conditions to germinate. During germination, the embryo absorbs water, causing the seed coat to rupture, and begins to grow. The radicle emerges first, forming the primary root, followed by the shoot apical meristem, which pushes its way through the soil and develops into the plant's stem and leaves. In summary, the formation of an embryo is a fundamental step in the process of plant reproduction. It occurs through the fusion of sperm and egg cells, leading to the development of a new plant from a single-celled zygote into a complex multicellular organism. This process allows for the perpetuation of genetic information and the continuation of plant species across generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Michael has become bored with his passive life style, and has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby. He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. Who will increase the size of their muscles less? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Robert will increase the size of his muscles less compared to Michael. This is because Michael has chosen to take up weightlifting as a hobby and exercises with weights several times a week, while Robert is mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. Weightlifting, an anaerobic exercise, focuses on contracting skeletal muscles against resistance, leading to increased muscle size and strength. When a person consistently engages in this type of exercise, they stimulate the growth of muscle fibers, improving both muscle mass and overall muscle performance. On the other hand, exercising infrequently or being inactive, as Robert is, leads to muscle atrophy—gradually losing muscle mass and strength. This \\"use it or lose it\\" principle applies to all muscles; without regular use, muscles will grow weaker and smaller in size. In summary, because Michael consistently exercises with weights several times a week while Robert exercises infrequently, Michael's muscles will grow larger and stronger, whereas Robert's muscles will increase in size and strength less noticeably."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - chesapeake bay - underpants - seychelles - fishing boat - cooking pot Answer:","completion":"A very bad place to find a crab, in line with common sense, would be underpants. While crabs can naturally be present in various aquatic environments and are typically caught via fishing boats or found in cooking pots, encountering a crab within one's underpants is definitely an unusual and disturbing experience. Chesapeake Bay, Seychelles, fishing boats, and cooking pots are all locations where finding a crab could be logically expected or even desired. Chesapeake Bay and Seychelles are coastal regions with abundant marine life, and it is only natural for crabs to inhabit such ecosystems. Fishing boats, being vessels designed for commercial and recreational fishing, can be expected to have crabs on board as part of their catch or as bait for larger fish. Cooking pots are also a common place to find crabs when they are being prepared as food in various cuisines. On the other hand, finding a crab in one's underpants would not only be painful and uncomfortable (as crabs have sharp claws that could pinch the skin), but also highly surprising and alarming. There is no logical reason for a crab to be present in undergarments, considering these environments are drastically different from the crab's natural aquatic habitat. Furthermore, having a crab in one's underpants would imply a serious breach of hygiene and personal boundaries. In summary, underpants are the option most in line with common sense as the worst place to find a crab due to the reasons mentioned above. It is an unexpected, uncomfortable, and potentially hazardous situation to have a crab in one's underwear, whereas the other options provided are places where crabs can be found or utilized in a more natural or expected context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To date, Stone Sour have released six studio albums Stone Sour (2002); Come What(ever) The band released a song called \\"The Pessimist\\" as a free download on their Facebook page on March 27, 2012. The song was previously only available on the iTunes deluxe version of the soundtrack to Transformers: Dark of the Moon. They also released their first DVD Live at Brighton in the same year, capturing their performance on November 7, 2010. It was announced via Instagram on May 3, 2012 that bassist Shawn Economaki had parted ways with the band on amicable terms. He was replaced in the studio by current Skid Row bassist Rachel Bolan. Stone Sour started recording their fourth studio album in early 2012. Corey Taylor stated that the album would end up being a double album or concept album, and described the album's sound as \\"Pink Floyd's The Wall meets Alice in Chains's Dirt\\". It was later announced that the new material would be released as two separate albums. The first album, House of Gold & Bones - Part 1 was released worldwide on October 23, 2012, and the second album House of Gold & Bones - Part 2 was released worldwide on April 9, 2013. The project also has a 4-part graphic novel series that accompanies the albums, telling the linear storyline featured in the twin albums' lyrics. The first two songs from Part 1, \\"Gone Sovereign\\" and the first official single, \\"Absolute Zero\\" were released for radio airplay in mid/late August 2012. The first single from House of Gold & Bones Part 2 was \\"Do Me a Favor\\". It was released digitally on February 12. Guitarist Josh Rand stated in an interview with O2 Academy that there was a song recorded for Part 1, an instrumental which was deemed 'not up to par' by the band. The song will likely be released in the future once James Root and Josh Rand do 'some stuff to it guitar-wise'. On October 5, 2012, Johny Chow of Fireball Ministry and Cavalera Conspiracy was announced as the bassist for the band on the House of Gold & Bones tour cycle. Stone Sour subsequently played Soundwave Festival 2013 in Australia and on the Sunday at Download Festival 2013. Guitarist James Root did not tour with Stone Sour in the winter of 2013, as he had to take a brief hiatus from the group to work on .5: The Gray Chapter with Slipknot, although it was later revealed that he was fired from the band due to musical differences. He claimed that the band wanted to focus on \\"radio play and money,\\" in which Root fought against, and that led to a split. Christian Martucci filled in for Root during that period.","completion":"The text is about the American rock band, Stone Sour. Established in Des Moines, Iowa in 1992, the band was active until 1997 before a brief hiatus. They reunited again in 2000, with some changes in membership occurring over the years. As of 2006, the band members included Corey Taylor on lead vocals and guitar, Josh Rand as the guitarist, and Roy Mayorga as the drummer. Former members Joel Ekman, Shawn Economaki, and Jim Root, who played drums, bass guitar, and guitar respectively, left Stone Sour in 2006, 2011 and 2014. As of the text's statement, the band has produced six studio albums and among their releases is a song titled \\"The Pessimist,\\" which was initially exclusive to the iTunes deluxe version of the soundtrack to Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but was later released as a free download. Stone Sour's first DVD, capturing a live performance, was also released in 2012. Later that same year, bassist Shawn Economaki amicably left the band and Rachel Bolan, Skid Row's bassist at the time, stepped in to replace him. The band started recording their fourth studio album in 2012, with the implication that it may be a double or concept album. The final decision was to release the material as two separate albums titled \\"House of Gold & Bones - Part 1\\" and \\"House of Gold & Bones - Part 2\\". These albums were accompanied by a 4-part graphic novel series that lined up with the storyline in the albums' lyrics. During the recording process of these albums, a song deemed unsatisfactory by the band was withheld from the first album. Guitarist Josh Rand hinted at the possibility of this song's release after being improved upon in the future. In October of the same year, Johny Chow of the bands Fireball Ministry and Cavalera Conspiracy stepped in as the bassist for the duration of Stone Sour's House of Gold & Bones tour. Stone Sour experienced another shake-up in their lineup when guitarist James Root took a break from the band to work on a Slipknot album in the winter of 2013 but was later said to be fired from the band due to musical differences.

I could not even get passed the first story. This movie should not be compared to Tales from the Crypt. What is going to happen to the fate of our low budget movie industry? Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"There is a negative tone to this product review. The title of the review, \\"tales from the grave,\\" suggests a reference to the content of the movie, which may not necessarily indicate a positive or negative perception. However, upon reading the actual content of the review, it is clear that the reviewer holds a negative opinion of the film. The first sentence of the review states, \\"I wish I could have given it 0 stars.\\" This explicitly highlights the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the movie and is a strong indication of a negative tone. The use of the phrase \\"0 stars\\" emphasizes that the reviewer does not believe the movie is even worthy of the lowest possible rating. Furthermore, the reviewer describes the movie as \\"horrible\\" and they could not even get past the first story. This indicates that the reviewer had an intensely negative experience with the film, finding it unbearable to watch. The comparison made between the movie in question and \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" is done in a negative context. The wording used – \\"This movie should not be compared to Tales from the Crypt\\" – suggests that the reviewer is offended by the idea of associating the movie they are reviewing with another, presumably more well-regarded, film. Finally, the reviewer's concern about the fate of the low-budget movie industry further emphasizes the negative tone. The implication is that the movie is so poor in quality that it could negatively influence the entire industry, casting doubt on its future. Overall, the tone of this product review is decidedly negative, as the reviewer strongly communicates their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the movie, as well as their concern for the future of low-budget films based on the quality of the film in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let's add 432 to both sides of the equation to move the constant: 0 + 432 = -24*m -432 + 432 Which simplifies to: 432 = -24*m Next, to remove the coefficient of m (-24), we need to divide both sides of the equation by -24: 432 / -24 = (-24*m) / -24 This simplifies to: -18 = m (Since 432 divided by -24 equals -18.)

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is cell Y moving up or down the concentration gradient? Hint: Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy.

Second question: Would you characterize Edward Snowden as a hero, a patriot, both, or neither? Why? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Options: (A). no; (B). yes;","completion":"First, let's discuss Edward Snowden and his actions before addressing both questions: Edward Snowden is a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who leaked classified information from the NSA in 2013. This information revealed extensive global surveillance programs, many of which were conducted by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance. The leaked documents brought light to the mass surveillance of internet activity, phone records, and foreign government leaders. Now, let's address each question separately: 1. Is Edward Snowden a hero? Answering this question requires a discussion of whether Snowden's actions had a positive or negative impact on society and citizens' rights. To determine if he is a hero, we must consider if his motives were genuine, as well as the consequences of his actions for both the USA and the world. On one hand, supporters argue that Snowden is a hero who defended citizens' rights and uncovered governmental abuse of power. They believe he ignited an important global conversation about privacy and government surveillance, leading to increased awareness about digital privacy and eventual legislative changes. On the other hand, critics assert that Snowden compromised national security by revealing classified information, which potentially weakened intelligence operations against terrorist organizations and other threats. They argue that his methods were irresponsible and dangerous, and that he should have reported his concerns to appropriate oversight bodies instead of leaking classified information to the media. 2. Would you characterize Edward Snowden as a hero, a patriot, both, or neither? Why? Characterizing Edward Snowden involves discussing whether his actions were heroic and patriotic, or not. A hero is someone who takes personal risks for the greater good, whereas a patriot is a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies or detractors. Arguing that Snowden is a hero implies that one believes his actions were taken with the intention of benefiting society. People who hold this view may think he was willing to sacrifice his personal safety and freedom to expose violations of citizens' privacy rights. If one believes that Snowden's actions were primarily motivated by a love for his country and a desire to protect its ideals of freedom and democracy, then they might consider him a patriot. If one believes that Snowden's actions demonstrate both heroic and patriotic qualities, labeling him as both a hero and a patriot would be appropriate. Conversely, if one concludes that his actions were neither heroic nor patriotic, then neither label would apply. In summary, while the first question focuses on whether Snowden's actions were heroic, the second question asks for a broader characterization that includes heroism, patriotism, both, or neither. So, the answer to whether the two questions are asking the same thing is (A) no. The second question expands the scope of characterization, while the first question solely focuses on heroism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Math Problem Solve 1903 = 942*v + 40525 for v.","completion":"To solve the equation 1903 = 942*v + 40525 for v, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable v In order to isolate the term with the variable v, we need to eliminate the constant term (40525) from the right side of the equation. To do that, we'll subtract 40525 from both sides of the equation to keep it balanced. 1903 - 40525 = 942*v + 40525 - 40525 Step 2: Simplify the equation Now, simplify the left side of the equation by performing the subtraction: -38522 = 942*v Step 3: Solve for v To solve for v, we'll now divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of v (which is 942) to isolate the variable: -38522 / 942 = 942*v / 942 Step 4: Simplify and determine the value of v Now, simplify the equation by performing the division: v = -40.89 (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, the value of v in the given equation is approximately -40.89."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: - The fire surrounds the vicinity - The animals are trapped - Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - The survivors must find a new habitat - Conflict with other animals occur. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"Based on the chronological flow of the events described, the first step of the process seems to be \\"The fire surrounds the vicinity.\\" Before diving into further details, it's important to understand what this means in the context of wildlife and nature. When we say \\"the fire surrounds the vicinity,\\" we are referring to a wildfire or a forest fire that breaks out in a certain area, most likely a forested region replete with diverse fauna. It could be instigated due to numerous reasons, such as natural factors like lightning, volcanic eruptions, or even through human activities like arson, discarded cigarettes, unattended campfires etc. Such fires tend to spread rapidly, assisted by wind, geography, or density of the vegetation around. As the wildfire spreads, it engulfs its immediate surroundings, creating a combustion zone where the temperatures rise extraordinarily. This extreme heat is not only destructive but also leads to the formation of a convective column of rising hot air and gases, which further fuels the fire. Once the fire starts, it's almost immediate that the vicinity - the area surrounding the initial point of the fire outbreak - is surrounded. The fire at this scale is incredibly hard to control, especially if the conditions are dry. The surrounding vicinity, home to thousands of flora and fauna species, now face an immediate and severe threat. In the ecological context, this event marks the beginning of a domino effect, leading to the subsequent steps outlined in the question – the entrapment of animals, the destruction of habitats, survivors having to find new habitats and then conflicts arising in these new habitats due to increased competition for resources. However, it's important to note, that in human intervention contexts, the first step is usually preparation and prevention efforts, such as creating fire prevention plans, raising awareness, ensuring that there’s an effective system in place for detecting and combating wildfires, and managing forests to maintain their health and resilience. These measures aim to ensure that the first step in the above-described process, does not occur, or at least to minimize its scale and impact if it inevitably does. In conclusion, it appears that 'The fire surrounds the vicinity' is identified as the first step in the process for the scenarios described in your question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a title for this article: This 2012 photo shows Farragut North station, which doesn’t look much better now, with the ceiling still under repair and the escalator to the right of the brown pylon shut for rehabilitation. (Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post) The debate, such as it was, over Metro’s weekend track work program occurred in 2011. During the first half of the year, Metro managers outlined their plans for an increasingly aggressive approach to rehabilitating a deteriorating system. They described plans to make station closings a more frequent part of the weekend rebuilding activities.They did not want to shut down entire lines, but did consider ending the night-owl service on Friday and Saturday nights to speed up the rebuilding. That was rejected, but other basic elements of the plan remain in place, including the weekend combinations of station shutdowns on some lines and track-sharing around other work zones. Extended disruptions on long holiday weekends became a regular part of the program. The black-out dates with no service disruptions were to be very limited: Cherry Blossom Festival, July 4, Thanksgiving weekend, demonstrations and “select events,” Christmas and New Year’s. There wasn’t a great deal of public discussion about this plan. But there’s been plenty since, as Metro has pretty much stuck with the program, rarely altering its track work schedule because of events likely to draw big crowds. In the nation’s capital, Metro managers say, there’s always a big crowd for something — sometimes for several somethings at once. This Sunday afternoon, for example, the University of Maryland is holding a graduation ceremony in College Park and D.C. United is playing at RFK Stadium. Ballston has the Taste of Arlington street festival. Metro’s weekend work on the Green, Orange and Red lines is bound to affect people attending those events. We’ve got at least a few more years of this, and the impact on weekend travelers, communities and businesses continues to evolve. I’ve received complaints about last weekend’s disruption on the west side of the Orange Line, and plan to have a letter about that in my Sunday column. But here’s another that also will convey the bewilderment and frustration of people who get caught up in these disruptions. Dear Dr. Gridlock: Friday night [May 10], over 37,000 fans attended the Nats-Cubs game, and 20,000 attended the Caps playoff game. With nearly 60,000 sports fans attending these two events, and both ending between 9:30 and 10 p.m., why didn’t Metro consider delaying the start of their weekend track work until maybe midnight so these folks could get home? My brother had been more or less forced to park at the West Falls Church Metro station because of the unmoving inbound traffic on I-66. When he took the Orange Line to get back to his car, the trip was terminated at Ballston because it was a few minutes after 10 p.m. So here there is a trainload of mostly Nationals fans fighting to get on the three shuttle buses available; in a few minutes they were joined by a couple of trainloads of Caps fans, and the added enjoyment of a sudden cloudburst. Eventually he managed to share a taxi to West Falls Church. A large percentage of the fans who ride Metro to sporting events are not regular Metro users, as evidenced by the huge lines for the fare card machines before and after the games. It seems to me that if Metro is trying to lure more commuters out of their cars and into the transit system, treating them like this can only turn them completely off and kill any chance of their becoming regular Metro users. These were publicly advertised events, and a little common sense would have made it immediately evident that shutting down large chunks of the system before these folks had a chance to complete their trips was a really bad if not incredibly stupid idea. – Mike Kelley, Alexandria Title:","completion":"\\"Metro's Weekend Work and Big Events: A Tricky Balance for Travelers\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hunter was born in New York City, the son of Gertrude (nee Gelien) and Charles Kelm. His mother, from Hamburg, was a German Roman Catholic immigrant, and his father was Jewish. Hunter's father was reportedly abusive, and within a few years of his birth, his parents divorced. Tab grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (nee Sonnenfleth) Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song \\"Young Love,\\" which was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart) and became one of the larger hits of the Rock 'n' Roll era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. He had the hit, \\"Ninety-Nine Ways,\\" which peaked at No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. His success prompted Jack L. Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the Warner Bros. studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival Paramount Pictures), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter. Hunter's acting career was also at its zenith. William Wellman used him again in a war film, Lafayette Escadrille (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, Gunman's Walk (1958), a film that Hunter considers his favorite role. Hunter starred in the 1958 musical film Damn Yankees, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington, D.C.'s American League baseball club. The film had originally been a Broadway show, but Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant by Douglass Wallop. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director George Abbott was only interested in recreating the stage version word for word. He also starred in They Came to Cordura (1959), with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth. Sidney Lumet starred him opposite Sophia Loren in That Kind of Woman (1959).

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. What did the author say about the Australian sun?

Powerful thunderstorm caused flight delays at New York's airports - including Newark and JFK on Saturday. Temperatures reached 90 degrees in some states. Rain welcome in areas hit by drought. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Thunderstorms Bring Rain and Relief to the East Coast Hey kids! Let me tell you about something cool that happened recently. There were some big thunderstorms on the east coast of the United States. A thunderstorm is like a big, noisy rain party up in the sky. It happens when lots of heavy clouds come together, and it can bring lots of rain, thunder, and lightning. These thunderstorms soaked a few places, like the coast of a state called Georgia, another state called South Carolina, and the top part of Florida, which is shaped like a boot. All these places got a whole lot of water from the sky. Now, you might wonder if the people living in these places were sad and upset because they got wet. But actually, they were quite happy. Some places were very dry and in need of water, so the rain from the thunderstorms was like a breath of fresh air for them. This is because a drought had been affecting these areas. A drought is when a place does not get rain or water for a very long time. But there was a little bit of a problem with this big rain party. In New York, which is another state far up north, there were more thunderstorms. And these storms were so loud and wild that they made some airplanes wait before they could fly. Airports like Newark and JFK had many flights that were slowed down because of the thunderstorms. But soon enough, the storms passed, and the airplanes could fly again. And guess what? It was also very hot in some of the places. It was almost like being at the beach! In some states, it was so hot that it was 90 degrees outside. That's VERY warm! When it's that hot, it's important to stay cool and drink plenty of water. So, in the end, the thunderstorms brought rain to those who needed it, made the east coast cooler than before, and taught us all that sometimes nature can have a little bit of excitement. The earth needs water to live, and storms like these help bring it where it's needed the most. So, even though thunderstorms can sometimes be loud and scary, they also help the earth stay happy and healthy!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question 2: Seeviduva word meaning in Tamil? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To address these questions, we'll approach each question one by one and provide detailed responses. Question 1: How does hyperbolic lens reduce spherical aberration? Step 1: Understand the concept of spherical aberration Spherical aberration is an optical problem that occurs when light rays passing through a lens do not converge at a single focal point. This issue arises mainly due to the shape of the lens, as spherical lenses have a varying surface curvature. As a result, off-axis rays have different focal lengths compared to the on-axis rays, leading to blurred and distorted images. Step 2: Understand the concept of hyperbolic lens A hyperbolic lens, on the other hand, has a non-spherical surface with a hyperbolic profile. This unique shape eliminates the need for uniform curvature, which is the primary cause of spherical aberration in conventional lenses. Step 3: Explain how the hyperbolic lens reduces spherical aberration The hyperbolic lens reduces spherical aberration because its shape enables all incoming light rays to focus on the same point, regardless of whether they are off-axis or on-axis. This improved focusing ability of the hyperbolic lens significantly reduces blurriness, distortion, and spherical aberration, producing clear and sharp images. Question 2: Seeviduva word meaning in Tamil? Step 1: Identify the language and context The requested meaning is for a word in Tamil, which is a Dravidian language predominantly spoken in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry. Step 2: Understand the word \\"Seeviduva\\" The word \\"Seeviduva\\" doesn't seem to be a proper Tamil word. There may be some error in the spelling or transliteration. Ensuring the proper spelling or context will improve the chances of identifying the correct meaning. Step 3: Provide the best possible answer given the information Without the correct spelling or context, providing an accurate meaning for \\"Seeviduva\\" in Tamil is impossible. Kindly provide the correct spelling or context, and I would be happy to help with the meaning. To answer your final question: No, the answers to the two questions will not be the same, as they cover entirely distinct subjects.

Q: Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation. Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. I'm gay and around March last year began getting close with a bisexual friend of mine. By 'close' I mean platonically so. I did have feelings for him but he didn't feel the same way. We spent a lot of time together, spoke a lot, and seemed to think very highly of each other. I got a big red flag when he tried to make out with me at a party we were both at. This wasn't uncommon behaviour for him, but I took issue with it being directed at me. I forgave him -- he was drunk, after all -- but asked him not to do it again because it was messing with my feelings a little bit. He tried it twice more on two separate occasions before I finally decided I needed some space to deal with my feelings properly. The decision to distance myself was a complicated one; I knew our mutual friends were fed up with him and were on the brink of ditching him, but at the same time I felt suffocated in the relationship and wanted that to end. The problem was that he would be completely alone (he didn't have much of a family at the time) and I didn't want that for him. Nonetheless, I chose to distance myself anyway and made it clear why. I thought that the least helpful thing would be to freeze him out without explanation and that knowing would perhaps make things easier to process. This lasted for a week. It turned out we were, once again, both present at the same house party. I avoided talking to him and generally stuck to chatting with random people and seeing how it went. Little did I know he was going to try to hang himself in the home-owners garage, or at least that is what it looked like. After seeing him stumble in there, I figured I ought to check on him because I knew there were loads of dangerous tools in rather precarious places and he might knock something over and hurt himself or something. Well, I caught him as I did and we ended up having a long -- rather touchy, on his side of things -- conversation about what was going on. He blamed me for all of it and told me that it was because I'd made him feel guilty. He explained that he loved me, that things could be different if he wasn't afraid of his sexuality, and how he wanted me to promise I wouldn't leave him. Foolishly, I made that promise, if only because I wanted it to make him feel better. The next day I spoke to him about it because I couldn't really sleep after seeing him all strung up like that. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help. He said no, but that he would consider the account of everything I'd told him and get back to me. In spite of saying very little about anything else, he told me to discount what he said about loving me. At this point, I just rolled my eyes and waited patiently for a reply that I didn't get. Instead, I heard three different versions of that same story from our mutual friends all over the course of the next month, all which painted me in a bad light. I began to wonder if there was something terrible I'd done but deluded myself into thinking I hadn't. This time I was a little more direct and asked him about it straight up. He then admitted that he was self-harming and blamed it on me, again. From that point onwards I have had recurrent dreams about it and have not been able to absolve my guilt for something which, I can reason now, was not my responsibility. Our mutual friends speculated that he was self-harming, based on something they'd noticed, and I confirmed it for them hoping they'd treat him a little better. A week later all of our mutual friends had ditched him, and to this day I don't really know why. I can make some educated guesses, but I've never heard any proper explanations. Either way, I thought it was unfair for them to ditch him despite knowing what they did. This meant that I was the only person he really had any more, which wasn't great for me but I accepted that and tried to help. I stayed up night after night to keep him company and, combining that with the guilt of what he'd accused me of, I became very depressed. I gradually isolated myself from everybody but him and neglected the advice of all the friends who told me to stop helping him. I wasn't going to, though, because they were unwilling to give him a second chance and he'd still be all alone. Suddenly he froze me out and started trying very hard to get back in with these mutual friends again. My poor judgement in isolating myself meant that it was now I who had nobody I was particularly close to anymore and, having become rather unpersonable and irritable in person, nobody was particularly interested in my company. Most of all, I felt betrayed. I'd tried to help him the best I could and after all they'd done to him he was in the process of ditching me in favour of them. I spoke to him about it and he called me selfish for talking about my feelings. I warned him about them -- they'd not only hurt him but countless people in the past, and I think they're pretty callous -- to which he accused me of attempting to manipulate him because, apparently, I wanted control over him. It was at this point I learned that he'd turned to drugs to cope. I told an official trained in pastoral support because I was no longer in a position to help at all and I didn't want to see him running himself into the ground like that. I know it has helped him in the long-run, and it has also meant that his family are looking out for him a lot more now and making sure they're present in his life. We argued at this point more than we talked normally. I often got angry and was generally scathing to him in these instances, and he'd accuse me of doing all sorts of heinous things that I wouldn't even dream of doing. Depression worsened and my feelings for him hadn't gone, neither had the guilt or the dreams, and any attempt to talk to him about any of this he took severe issue with. On one occasion I lashed out verbally and, I'm told, really hurt him. I remember that I was not pleasant whatsoever and I take responsibility for that. After this, he nearly hit me at another house party and I decided I'd had enough. He ended up in with our mutual 'friends' -- who, at this point, had ditched me -- and I wondered if I'd been so unreasonably terrible that this was what I deserved. I decided to go see a counsellor from this point onwards. I hadn't spoken to him in four months and have only recently been in contact with him again. The dreams haven't gone and neither has the guilt, and I've asked him if I can talk to him about it. I understand it might be hard for him to talk about all of that stuff, but I feel that if I can reconcile what happened and understand my place in it all I might be able to sleep properly again. Having asked him, he refused on the basis that I'd try to manipulate him again (not that I see where I did this in the first place) and try to turn him against his friends. I pushed for it and he's finally agreed. I'm asking here if I'm the arsehole in this situation because my current friends all become very shifty when I ask them for advice. I don't want to push him, but I'm at a point in my life where I can't afford to be losing sleep over something I think can be ended like this. Thanks in advance.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Staying sane, to a large degree, is about feeling like you are in control of your life. While we cannot control everything, calmly dealing with problems and setting long-term goals will give you a sense of agency and control. Staying sane is about knowing your needs and wants and feeling like you can fulfill them. While it is easy to get caught up in negative emotions, we should remember to talk about what makes us happy.

Please answer this question: How many violins are in a string quartet?","completion":"A string quartet typically consists of four musicians playing stringed instruments, such as violins, viola, and cello. Within a standard string quartet formation, there are two violins, one viola, and one cello. These four instruments work together to create a harmonious blend of sound, with each instrument having its distinct role in the ensemble. The two violinists in a string quartet play different parts or roles. The first violinist usually holds the responsibility of playing the higher melodic lines or lead melodies, often taking on a more prominent role in the performance. This violinist is also sometimes referred to as the concertmaster or leader of the ensemble. The second violinist, on the other hand, plays an equally important role by providing harmony, counter-melodies, and rhythmic support to complement the first violin. The second violinist's part is generally written in a lower register than the first violin. As for the other two instruments in the string quartet, the viola and cello also have crucial responsibilities in creating the overall texture and sound of the ensemble. The viola, being larger and slightly lower in pitch than the violin, supports the middle harmonies, providing richness and depth to the music. The cello, with its larger size and even lower pitch, serves as the backbone of the ensemble by playing the bass lines, offering a resonant, grounding foundation for the other instruments. The balance of different registers within a string quartet allows for a vast range of musical possibilities, from intricate contrapuntal works to lush romantic harmonies. The string quartet genre has a rich history, with some of the greatest composers in classical music history, such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Joseph Haydn, having contributed to the development and evolution of the form. In conclusion, a string quartet typically includes two violins, with each violinist fulfilling a specific yet complementary role in the ensemble. The presence of a viola and a cello further diversifies the music, and together, the four instruments create a blend of sound that is both captivating and sophisticated, making the string quartet a beloved and valued chamber music ensemble."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer choices: - pollen - infertility - gametes - orchids - seeds - no physical contact - honeybees - isolation A:","completion":"Fertilization is the process of fusion between two gametes, which results in the formation of a new single cell called a zygote. This process is a significant initial step in sexual reproduction, as it allows for the combination of genetic material from two parent organisms, facilitating genetic diversity within offspring. The cause of fertilization, as mentioned in the question, is indeed the usage of gametes. To provide further context and explanation of the answer choices given: 1. Gametes: The correct answer is gametes, as fertilization is facilitated by the fusion of male and female gametes. The male gamete, called a sperm cell, fuses with the female gamete, known as an egg or ovum, leading to the formation of a zygote. 2. Pollen: Pollen is not directly responsible for fertilization but plays a critical role in plant reproduction by transporting male gametes to female reproductive structures. Pollination is the process of transferring pollen from the male reproductive organs (the anthers) of a flower to the female reproductive organs (the stigma) of the same or another flower. Upon reaching the stigma, the pollen tube grows, transporting the sperm cells to the ovule where fertilization occurs. 3. Infertility: Infertility is a condition that results in the inability to conceive or achieve a successful pregnancy. It does not cause fertilization but rather impedes or prevents it from occurring. 4. Orchids: Orchids are a family of flowering plants that reproduce sexually through the process of fertilization. They are not a direct cause of fertilization but rather an example of organisms that undergo the process to produce offspring. 5. Seeds: Seeds are developed after fertilization has taken place in a plant. They are the mature ovules containing an embryo and are not responsible for causing fertilization. 6. No physical contact: Fertilization typically requires some degree of physical contact between the male and female gametes, although in some cases, such as artificial insemination, the contact could be indirect. No physical contact does not cause fertilization. 7. Honeybees: Honeybees are pollinators that play an essential role in plant reproduction, particularly in the transfer of pollen from the male to female reproductive structures in flowers. While they are not a direct cause of fertilization, they significantly contribute to the pollination process, which ultimately enables fertilization to occur. 8. Isolation: Isolation hinders the process of fertilization, as it restricts the accessibility of male and female gametes to each other, thereby preventing their fusion. Isolation does not cause fertilization. In summary, among the given answer choices, fertilization is caused by the usage of gametes. Gametes are specialized reproductive cells, and their fusion forms a zygote, which goes on to develop into a new organism. Other answer choices either facilitate or hinder the process but are not the direct cause of fertilization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The retreat to Texas is mentioned in both the premise and the hypothesis.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work. But I can use this background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. What is an answer for this question: Who is exposed to sounds that are less dangerous? The answer is:","completion":"Alexander is exposed to sounds that are less dangerous. This is because Alexander works in a library where he is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work. The environment in a library is generally quiet and peaceful, as opposed to Jeremy's workplace, the construction site, where he operates a jackhammer and a large welding machine. These machines create high-decibel noises that can be dangerous as they have greater intensity and loudness. According to the information provided, every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound results in 10 times greater loudness, and high-decibel sounds can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Thus, Alexander's work environment is comparatively safer in terms of noise exposure in contrast to Jeremy's construction site work environment."},{"prompt":"Given the question: You are given a new situation: Bob and Andy were two nature enthusiasts.

In both contexts, the word \\"charge\\" refers to the price/cost or monetary value that someone assigns to a service or a product. The word \\"charge\\" can be understood as the fee that needs to be paid in exchange for receiving a particular good or service. In the first sentence, \\"How much do you charge for lunch?\\", the speaker is inquiring about the cost of a lunch meal. They want to know the price that they need to pay in order to enjoy the lunch being offered. In this case, \\"charge\\" signifies the amount that needs to be paid for the lunch. In the second sentence, \\"This fellow charges 100 for a massage.\\", the speaker is referencing someone who provides massage services. The cost or fee to receive a massage from that individual is 100. Here, \\"charge\\" is again about the payment that the service provider expects to receive for rendering their services.

Many Poles, especially among the intellectual and professional classes, opposed Soviet influence and Communist rule, and in 1956 the regime faced its first real test. Does it follow that \\"The Russians remained in Poland for two more decades.\\"? Choose your answer from: i. yes. ii. it is not possible to tell. iii. no.","completion":"ii. It is not possible to tell. The information provided outlines the opposition faced by the communist regime in Poland in 1956, mainly from the intellectual and professional classes. It does not, however, provide a direct correlation or timeline in regards to the duration of Russian presence in the country. To provide a more comprehensive response, it's necessary to explore more historical context. The Soviet influence in Poland began after World War II, with the Soviet Union occupying and installing a pro-Soviet communist government. Throughout the following decades, various events and uprisings took place as a result of dissatisfaction and opposition to the communist regime and Soviet influence. One significant event in this context is the Polish Crisis of 1956 (the year mentioned in the question), during which Władysław Gomułka, a reformer, rose to power as the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, with Soviet approval. Gomułka introduced some reforms and eased Poland's adherence to Soviet policies. In 1980, the Solidarity movement, led by Lech Wałęsa, emerged and gained significant momentum as a trade union and political organization in opposition to communism. The movement eventually led to negotiations with the communist government, resulting in the 1989 Round Table Talks, which paved the way for the reestablishment of democracy in Poland. The fall of communism in Poland occurred in 1989, and the gradual disintegration of the Soviet Union began around the same time, ultimately leading to its dissolution in 1991. In conclusion, it is important to note that while the question's statement about opposition to the communist regime in 1956 is accurate, it does not provide enough information to determine whether \\"The Russians remained in Poland for two more decades.\\" However, based on the broader historical context, we know that significant events in the 1980s and 1990s, such as the rise of the Solidarity movement and the fall of communism, led to a substantial decline in Soviet influence in Poland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (José Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clichéd comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins The answer is:","completion":"The final step in the process outlined is the generation of electricity, which is achieved through the conversion of the spinning turbine's mechanical energy into electrical energy using a device called a generator. To elaborate on this process, let's break it down into the following steps: 1. The process begins with the combustion of coal in a boiler. Coal, a fossil fuel, is primarily composed of carbon and hydrocarbons. When burned, it releases the chemical energy stored in its bonds in the form of heat. This heat is then used to produce steam by heating water in the boiler, which is present in abundance within the power plant system. 2. The steam that is produced is under high pressure due to the intense heat from the burning coal. This high-pressure steam is what provides the force necessary to drive the turbine and create mechanical energy. The steam is directed through a series of pipes and then onto the blades of a turbine, which is essentially a machine with numerous rotating blades (or vanes) mounted on a central shaft. 3. The high-pressure steam flows across the turbine blades, causing them to rotate rapidly. The steam's kinetic energy is transferred to the blades, which in turn causes the central shaft to rotate. The process of the steam transferring its energy to the blades and causing them to spin is continuous as long as there is a steady supply of high-pressure steam. 4. As the turbine spins, its mechanical energy must be converted into electrical energy. This is achieved using a generator, which is connected to the spinning shaft of the turbine. Inside the generator, there are large coils of wire (known as the stator) that remain stationary, while a rotating component (the rotor) consists of magnets. As the rotor spins with the turbine shaft, its magnetic field moves past the stationary coils of wire, inducing a flow of electric current within the coils. This is based on the principles of electromagnetic induction, which were first discovered by physicist Michael Faraday in the early 19th century. In conclusion, the final step of the mentioned process is the generation of electricity by converting the turbine's spinning mechanical energy into electrical energy through the use of a generator. This electricity is then transmitted to a power grid, which distributes it to households, businesses, and other users in the area served by the power plant. The entire process, starting with burning coal and finishing with electricity generation, is known as a coal-fired power plant or a thermal power plant. These plants have been a significant source of power generation worldwide, although there is growing concern about their environmental impacts, leading to a shift towards cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We can see that: - Both involve a man sitting - The premise specifically mentions the man is in the shadows, and shadows are formed when an object blocks light, causing the area behind it to be darker. Therefore, sitting in the shadows implies that the man is sitting in a place where the light is not reaching. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise. Based on our assessment in step 3: We can conclude that the hypothesis (\\"A man is sitting out of the light\\") is a plausible conclusion given the premise (\\"A man sits on steps in the shadows\\"), as the information in the premise aligns with the hypothesis.

Q:One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it. Williamson County population : 226,257 Wayne County population : 16,583 I ran a business with my father, graduated from a high school that was ranked 24/273 instead of one ranked of 223/273 in the state. The woman I married would not be the same, nor where I live and the lifestyle I now live, the jobs I have been able to get, the places I have been able to go, traveling around the US and to Canada and soon further abroad.

Question: This article: Cleveland was named on July 22, 1796, when surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company laid out Connecticut's Western Reserve into townships and a capital city. They named it \\"Cleaveland\\" after their leader, General Moses Cleaveland. Cleaveland oversaw design of the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on Public Square, before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814. In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, its waterfront location proved to be an advantage, giving access to Great Lakes trade. The area began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal. This key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected the city to the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and Hudson River, and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway. Its products could reach markets on the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Growth continued with added railroad links. Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836.In 1836, the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring Ohio City over a bridge connecting the two. Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its annexation by Cleveland in 1854. The city's prime geographic location as a transportation hub on the Great Lakes has played an important role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland serves as a destination for iron ore shipped from Minnesota, along with coal transported by rail. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in Cleveland. In 1885, he moved its headquarters to New York City, which had become a center of finance and business.Cleveland emerged in the early 20th century as an important American manufacturing center. Its businesses included automotive companies such as Peerless, People's, Jordan, Chandler, and Winton, maker of the first car... contains an answer for the question: What was the nickname of the city that was named on July 22, 1796 during the early 20th century?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The article provided does not explicitly mention the nickname of the city of Cleveland during the early 20th century. However, Cleveland has been historically known for various nicknames, such as \\"The Forest City,\\" \\"Metropolis of the Western Reserve,\\" \\"Sixth City,\\" and \\"The Rock and Roll Capital of the World.\\" Among these nicknames, \\"The Forest City\\" and \\"Sixth City\\" are most relevant to the early 20th century time period. \\"The Forest City\\" nickname originated in the 1830s and continued into the 20th century due to the city's abundance of green spaces and tree-lined streets. As an important manufacturing and commercial center, Cleveland has always been dedicated to preserving its environment, giving birth to this popular moniker. Another relevant nickname of Cleveland during the early 20th century is \\"Sixth City.\\" This nickname gained prevalence as a result of Cleveland's rapid growth and expansion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By the 1920s, Cleveland had become the sixth largest city in the United States, hence earning the nickname \\"Sixth City.\\" In conclusion, while the article does not directly provide a specific nickname for Cleveland during the early 20th century, based on historical context and other sources, the nicknames \\"The Forest City\\" and \\"Sixth City\\" can be considered the city's most relevant nicknames during that period."},{"prompt":"Q:I have a new situation: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect. But I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. What is an answer for this question: Which friend studied more about short wavelength solar energy? A:","completion":"Neither friend specifically focused on studying short wavelength solar energy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A transitional statement can help the person get ready for unexpected bad news. Although you want to get to the point right away instead of beating around the bush, you do want to at least prepare the person for the prospect of upsetting news. You can use phrases such as: \\"I have some sad news to tell you\\", \\"I've just received a call from the hospital: there has been an accident and...\\"; or \\"I've been talking to your specialist and...\\", \\"There is no easy way to say this but...\\" or \\"There's some really bad news you need to know...\\" etc. As you narrate the events, react to the emotions of the other person as they arise by acknowledging and addressing them. The most important part of breaking news is how well you respond to the other person's emotions. Make the connection between the identification of the emotions and the cause, and make it clear to the recipient that you get the connection. Do this by acknowledging their response, such as \\"This is a clearly a terrible shock\\" or \\"I can see that you're really upset and angry about what has happened\\", and so forth. Doing this lets the person know you get their pain or other reaction and that you've tied it to the news you've just relayed, without passing any judgment, making any assumptions, or trying to minimize their emotions. Everyone won't ask questions or demand answers after hearing upsetting news. Some people may just sit there in shock. It may take time to let the news sink in. If he or she does that, place your arm around the person’s shoulders and simply sit with him or her in a display of sympathetic solidarity. When comforting the person, keep in mind social and cultural conventions to avoid making the situation worse. It's all very well delivering bad news but there must be a strategy for after delivery of it. Action can help prevent a person from going into a state of shock, and can give them a sense of being involved or doing something to resolve, manage, deal with, or face the results of the bad news. Help to decide how to handle the news. If a person has died, how will the friend or relative cope? If a cat died, how will the owner honor it? If someone lost their job, how will they find a new one? Perhaps you can offer to take the recipient somewhere, such as visiting a hospital, gathering belongings, seeing a counselor, going to the police, or whatever is needed. Make it plain what is likely to happen next, especially with relation to your own involvement. If you're a doctor delivering bad news about treatment, for example, you might outline the next steps for the patient continuing to visit you. Simply letting the person know when you'll be around or back again to check on them can be a help in and of itself. Whatever promises you make to assist the person who has received bad news, be sure to follow through on what you've said you'll do. Give the person your time where possible, and be accepting of their need to grieve where relevant. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the importance of using transitional statements and effective communication to gently prepare someone for unexpected bad news, reacting to their emotions with understanding, providing comfort and support while being mindful of social and cultural conventions, and assisting them in navigating the aftermath by offering guidance or taking action to help handle the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Among the options provided, a \\"big house\\" directly refers to a large, possibly extravagant residence, indicating the place where the wealthy gentleman might live. In contrast, the other choices do not necessarily correlate with the lavish lifestyle of a wealthy individual: - Europe: While Europe is home to many wealthy individuals, it is a continent and not a specific living situation. There are wealthy people all around the world, and the gentleman in question could reside anywhere, not just Europe. - Tuxedo: A tuxedo is a type of formal attire typically worn on special occasions. It does not pertain to a place where someone would live or indicate whether the wearer is wealthy or not. - Palace: Although palaces are typically known to be grand and luxurious, they are usually associated with royalty or historically significant buildings. While a wealthy individual could potentially live in a palace-like mansion, the term \\"palace\\" does not specifically refer to a private residence. - Men's room: A men's room is a public restroom designated for men and has no relevance to the living situation of a wealthy gentleman.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Thomas \\"Tom\\" Sawyer is the title character of the Mark Twain novel \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" (1876). He appears in three other novels by Twain: \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (1884), \\"Tom Sawyer Abroad\\" (1894), and \\"Tom Sawyer, Detective\\" (1896). Hypothesis: Tom Sawyer appeared in four different Mark Twain books over the course of 15 years.","completion":"Upon analyzing the given paragraph, we learn that Thomas \\"Tom\\" Sawyer is indeed the title character of Mark Twain's novel \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\\" which was published in 1876. Furthermore, he is also a character in three other novels by the same author: \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (published in 1884), \\"Tom Sawyer Abroad\\" (published in 1894), and \\"Tom Sawyer, Detective\\" (published in 1896). The hypothesis states that Tom Sawyer appeared in four different Mark Twain books over the course of 15 years. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, we have to confirm two claims within it: that Tom Sawyer appeared in four books and that these books were published within a 15-year period. Regarding the first claim, the paragraph indeed confirms that Tom Sawyer appeared in a total of four Mark Twain novels: \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\\" \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" \\"Tom Sawyer Abroad,\\" and \\"Tom Sawyer, Detective.\\" To assess the second claim, we should examine the time span between the publication of the first and the last novel. The earliest novel, \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\\" was published in 1876, while the latest, \\"Tom Sawyer, Detective,\\" was released in 1896. Calculating the time that passed between these two books, we arrive at the following result: 1896 (the publication year of the last novel) - 1876 (the publication year of the first novel) = 20 years. This information reveals that the four novels featuring Tom Sawyer as a character were published over the course of 20 years, rather than 15. In conclusion, based on the provided paragraph, the hypothesis is partially correct. While Tom Sawyer did indeed appear in four different Mark Twain novels, the time span between the publication of the first and last books was 20 years, not 15 as the hypothesis suggests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's how I would do this step-by-step and my justification for each step: Step 1: Observe the service during your visit to the restaurant. Justification: By carefully observing the service, you can provide accurate and specific feedback about the staff. Step 2: Make mental or written notes of positive and negative aspects of the service. Justification: By noting specific incidents and the behavior of the staff members, it will be easier for you to report back to the manager later on. Step 3: Ask to speak with the manager before leaving the restaurant. Justification: Speaking to the manager while you are still at the restaurant allows you to give immediate feedback and ensures that your observations are fresh in your mind. Step 4: Be respectful and clear when discussing your experiences with the manager. Justification: Communicating in a respectful manner will make it more likely that the manager will take your feedback seriously and consider implementing improvements in the service. Step 5: When praising good service, mention the specific staff members who provided excellent service. Justification: By identifying the staff members who provided outstanding service, the manager can recognize and reward them accordingly, encouraging them to keep up the good work. Step 6: When discussing negative aspects, provide constructive criticism instead of blaming specific staff members. Justification: Offering suggestions for improvement focuses on finding a solution to the issue rather than placing blame, which promotes a positive and collaborative atmosphere.

Serial's Adnan Syed granted new trial In a Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2016 file photo, Adnan Syed enters Courthouse East in Baltimore prior to a hearing.(AAP) A US judge on Thursday ordered a new trial for a man convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend, whose case was turned into a global sensation by a hit podcast. Adnan Syed, 35, the son of Pakistani immigrants, was sentenced to life imprisonment 16 years ago for the murder of Hae Min Lee in suburban Baltimore. The case was largely ignored in the media until it was taken up by weekly podcast \\"Serial\\" and turned into a blockbuster when an American journalist revisited the story and cast doubt on Syed's guilt. Judge Martin Welch in Baltimore granted Syed's request for a new trial in a court document issued Thursday. \\"We won a new trial for Adnan Syed,\\" tweeted his defense lawyer Justin Brown. Maryland state prosecutors had fought against the move, insisting that Syed was given a fair defense and there was no need to reopen his case. The podcast, a mix of investigative journalism, first-person narrative and dramatic storytelling, focused its first season entirely on Syed's story in a nail-biting 12 episodes. The show cast doubt on whether Syed received proper representation at trial and whether he had in fact murdered Lee. At trial, prosecutors argued that Syed strangled Lee after school in the parking lot of a Best Buy electronics store, jealous that she was seeing another, older man after they broke up. Both were honor students and children from immigrant families -- Syed's from Pakistan and Lee's from South Korea -- who had concealed their relationship from their conservative parents. The show was downloaded more than 5 million times on the Apple iTunes store. It is also available at www.serialpodcast.org.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by. But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\" Do you have any questions?","completion":"Oh sure, sweetie, this might look a little complicated, but I'll try to make it easier for you. Imagine there is a big house called Women's Haven in a place called Tarrant County where ladies can go if they've been hurt or treated very badly. These poor ladies need special help from people called lawyers to make things right, especially for big grown-up stuff like who gets to keep the kids or their things when they don't want to live with the mean person anymore. But there's a problem. Some of these ladies don't have a lot of money and can't pay the lawyer. They may have some money but not enough to pay for this big help, and so they can't get all the legal help they need. The good news is that something called the federal Violence Against Women Office (like a big, special group meant to help these ladies) has given a lot of money to the Women's Haven. This money will be used to pay for another lawyer as well as help from law students from a nearby university. Even better, the money will fix this problem where some ladies aren't able to get help because they can't pay. And it's a big help for the law students too, as they get to learn and practice on real-world cases. Don't worry, though, because even though they are learning, they'll be doing great help.

She is in love with the woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), but her parents Cesaire (Billy Burke) and Suzette (Virginia Madsen) have promised wealthy blacksmith Adrian Lazar (Michael Shanks) that Valerie will marry his son Henry (Max Irons) hoping Valerie will marry into wealth so she and they can live off Lazar's money.Valerie plans to run away with Peter, but their plans are put on hold when the town sirens erupt, telling the couple that the werewolf who terrorizes their village has struck again. On closer inspection of the victim (found among a field of haystacks), it is found to be Lucy, Valerie's older sister. The townspeople offer a monthly sacrifice to the beast and stay away from the woods but Lucy ventured there after discovering that Valerie had been promised in engagement to Henry, whom Lucy loved.Adrian, Henry, Peter, Cesaire, and the other men venture out into the woods to a mountain cave hunt the Wolf. Against Henry's protest, the group splits into two groups and Henry and his father are attacked. The others manage to behead the wolf, but it kills Adrian in the process. The men bring back the head of a common gray wolf, thinking it is the one that has been terrorizing the village.Valerie sees Suzette crying over Adrian's body and confronts her. Suzette admits that she and Adrian once had an affair and that Lucy is actually his daughter as well as Henry's half-sister. This is the reason why she could not be offered to him. Valerie also learns that Cesaire is seemingly unaware of this.The townspeople decide to celebrate the death of the wolf, but their preparations are interrupted by the arrival of famous witch hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), who reveals that the townspeople did not slaughter the real Wolf because it would have changed back into its human form if they did.

Q: What is the term for the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid? A: Pick your answer from: * the starting point. * the mixture point. * the pressure point. * the melting point. Answer:","completion":"The term for the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid is the melting point. In the provided paragraph, it distinctly states that \\"the melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid.\\" As a result, the accurate answer from the given choices is the melting point. Understanding the concept of the melting point is essential in various fields such as chemistry, physics, and materials science. This physical property depends on factors like pressure, molecular structure, and presence of surrounding substances. Generally, the melting point is specific to a given substance, and it helps in both identifying and characterizing various materials. When heat is applied to a solid substance, its temperature will rise until the melting point is reached. At this point, the substance starts changing from solid to liquid phase. This transition occurs as the energy provided by heat weakens the bonds holding the particles together in a solid-state, allowing them to move more freely and form a liquid. One important thing to note is that the melting point is not the same as the freezing point. While the melting point pertains to the temperature at which a solid turns into a liquid, the freezing point refers to the temperature at which a liquid converts back into a solid. Nonetheless, for many substances, the melting and freezing points are identical under normal atmospheric pressure. Examples of such substances include water and most metals. So, to reiterate, the accurate term for the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid is the melting point, as directly obtained from the original paragraph."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - David Harbater (born December 19, 1952) is an American mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, well known for his work in Galois theory, algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry. - \\"Not to be confused with his wife Michèle Raynaud, who is also a French mathematician working in algebraic geometry.\\" - The term proposition has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other \\"propositional attitudes\\" (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of declarative sentences. Propositions are the sharable objects of attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and utterance-tokens which are not sharable, and concrete events or facts, which cannot be false. - In abstract algebra , Abhyankar 's conjecture is a 1957 conjecture of Shreeram Abhyankar , on the Galois groups of algebraic function fields of characteristic p. The soluble case was solved by Serre in 1990 and the full conjecture was proved in 1994 by work of Michel Raynaud and David Harbater . The problem involves a finite group G , a prime number p , and the function field of nonsingular integral algebraic curve C defined over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p. The question addresses the existence of Galois extensions L of K ( C ) , with G as Galois group , and with restricted ramification . From a geometric point of view L corresponds to another curve C , and a morphism : C C. Ramification geometrically , and by analogy with the case of Riemann surfaces , consists of a finite set S of points x on C , such that restricted to the complement of S in C is an étale morphism . In Abhyankar 's conjecture , S is fixed , and the question is what G can be . This is therefore a special type of inverse Galois problem . The subgroup p ( G ) is defined to be the subgroup generated by all the Sylow subgroups of G for the prime number p. This is a normal subgroup , and the parameter n is defined as the minimum number of generators of G / p ( G ) . Then for the case of C the projective line over K , the conjecture states that G can be realised as a Galois group of L , unramified outside S containing s + 1 points , if and only if n s. This was proved by Raynaud . For the general case , proved by Harbater , let g be the genus of C. Then G can be realised if and only if n s + 2 g. - Algebra (from Arabic \\"\\"al-jabr\\"\\" meaning \\"reunion of broken parts\\") is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians. - In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an algebraic structure is a set (called carrier set or underlying set) with one or more finitary operations defined on it that satisfies a list of axioms. - In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is . An example in three variables is . - In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers , , and satisfy the equation for any integer value of greater than 2. The cases and have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity. - In abstract algebra, field extensions are the main object of study in field theory. The general idea is to start with a base field and construct in some manner a larger field that contains the base field and satisfies additional properties. For instance, the set Q(2) = {\\"a\\" + \\"b\\"2 | \\"a\\", \\"b\\" Q} is the smallest extension of Q that includes every real solution to the equation \\"x\\" = 2. - In mathematics, more specifically in the area of modern algebra known as Galois theory, the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory, so named in honor of Évariste Galois who first discovered them. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory. Using Galois theory, certain problems in field theory can be reduced to group theory, which is, in some sense, simpler and better understood. - The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private, Ivy League university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as \\"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\\", Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges. - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \\"hypothesis\\" and \\"theory\\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research. - In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. The term \\"abstract algebra\\" was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra. - In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them. - Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros. - In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part . It was proposed by , after whom it is named. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Although the last half of this film was previously considered lost, it has been found and will be available on DVD and TCM in 2008. The film starts with a tongue-in-cheek flashback with Fairbanks as D'Artagnan (with broad winks at the audience), fighting and defeating a tavern-full of swordsmen just to return a mysterious lady's handkerchief. Through a lap-dissolve, d'Artagnan becomes the modern Kansan Ned Thacker, who was born during a tornado and whose mother read him swashbuckling novels while in the womb. After several episodes where Ned gets into trouble trying to defend women (and a cute cameo by Zasu Pitts), we meet Marjorie Daw, whose mother wants her to marry the rich sleazeball Forrest Vandeteer. They run into trouble on a cross-country automobile trip, and are rescued by Fairbanks when he converts his Ford into a railcar to cross a desert washout. At the El Tovar hotel, we meet the villainous Navajo Chin-de-dah, who lives in a secret cliff-house deep in the Grand Canyon, who leads Forrest and Marjorie to his lair with \\"forced marriage\\" on his mind. With the assistance of one of Chin-de-dah's henchmen, Ned Thacker descends the cliffs on a rope and effects a rescue. While the villain is a very unfortunate Indian stereotype, the footage of the Grand Canyon and Canyon de Chelly is spectacular, and taken in the spirit it was intended, this is a fun, somewhat carelessly constructed romp, and a good example of why Douglas Fairbanks was so popular. In the surviving material shown at the Buster Keaton Festival, some confusion is caused when Forrest Vandeteer's name changes to Forrest Barris part way through, probably because of a difference in the source material. Answer:","completion":"Question: How does Ned Thacker manage to save Marjorie Daw and put an end to the villainous plans of Navajo Chin-de-dah in the movie?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase \\"amazing\\" gives an unmistakable positive sentiment, signaling that the reviewer had a great experience at this particular location. 2. They mention they've been frequent visitors (\\"We've gone here almost every Monday since we moved here and love it\\"), which further solidifies the positive sentiment. This kind of loyalty towards a place is usually due to satisfaction with the services or products offered. 3. There's excitement about their deals and promotions (\\"You cannot beat the half-priced appetizers or drink specials that last ALL DAY on Monday's for football season\\") which shows that the user values the affordability and that they feel they are getting a great deal. 4. The mention of a few particular dishes (\\"my husband and I usually share an onion ring tower and a pizza\\") without any negative aspect implies they enjoy the food. 5. Terms like \\"Great food, great service\\" used here again confirm the positive sentiment about the restaurant's main offerings. 6. The comment \\"worth the wait\\" might suggest there's usually a crowd or a waiting time, but the reviewer makes it clear that they believe the quality of the experience outranks any inconvenience, which again, reiterates a positive sentiment. In conclusion, this review very clearly presents a positive sentiment towards the restaurant."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Passage: Alice Tate is an upper-class New York housewife, who spends her days shopping, getting beauty treatments, and gossiping with her friends. She has been married to wealthy Doug for fifteen years, and they have two children, who are being raised by a nanny. One day, she has a brief encounter with Joe Ruffalo, a handsome jazz musician. She finds herself mysteriously attracted to him and experiences Catholic guilt for these feelings. This inner turmoil manifests itself in a backache. She is referred to Dr. Yang, an Asian herbalist who puts her under hypnosis. She reveals that what initially attracted her to her husband were in fact his superficial qualities: looks and money. She also reveals her feelings about Joe. Dr. Yang gives Alice ancient herbs that make her act on her feelings toward Joe Ruffalo. They agree to meet. When the herbs wear off, Alice is appalled at her behavior. She does not go to meet him as planned. The next herbs she receives turn her invisible. She spies on Joe going to visit his ex-wife Vicky. Much to prudish Alice's horror, they make love in Vicky's office. Alice is now glad she did not go to meet Joe. However, the next herbal remedy allows Alice to communicate with the ghost of her first lover, Ed. He encourages her to find out more about Joe.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. With a title like that, it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did NOT appeal to me. Granted, there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse \\"shock\\" tactics... The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a \\"grabby\\" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he is going to kill them all. She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... Surely, \\"I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave\\" was intended as an unofficial sequel to \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton.

Options: A. feelings B. sexual excitement C. sparks fly D. problems E. unwanted pregnancy Answer:","completion":"C. sparks fly Out of the given options, \\"sparks fly\\" is the most suitable and in line with common sense for a machine shop scenario. Flirting can often be described as a situation where there's a hint of attraction or romantic interest between two individuals, and the metaphor \\"sparks fly\\" is commonly used to depict the initial stages of this attraction or chemistry. In a machine shop, which is typically a setting involving metalwork, welding, and various mechanical operations, it's quite normal to witness sparks flying due to the nature of the work being performed. In this context, the term \\"sparks fly\\" can figuratively represent the interaction and connection between two individuals in the form of teasing, playful remarks, or subtle hints at romantic interest. While the other options may also relate to flirting in various ways, they don't fit well with the machine shop scenario. Feelings (A) and sexual excitement (B) directly relate to emotions and attraction, but don't connect to a machine shop setting.

In order to do so, follow these steps: Step 1: Add 2538*k to both sides of the equation. This will eliminate the -2538*k term on the right side of the equation. -2556*k - 180 + 2538*k = -2538*k + 2538*k Combine the terms: (2538*k - 2556*k) - 180 = 0 Step 2: Subtraction of the k terms: -18*k - 180 = 0 Step 3: We want to isolate k completely, so add 180 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant (-180) on the left side of the equation. -18*k = 180 Step 4: To find the value of k, we'll now divide by -18 on both sides of the equation: k = 180 / -18 Step 5: Simplify the equation: k = -10 So, the solution for the given equation -2556*k - 180 = -2538*k is k = -10."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The largest population centres of the Sinhalese diaspora are mainly situated in Europe, North America and Australia. The city of Melbourne contains just under half of the Sri Lankan Australians. The 2011 census recorded 86,412 Sri Lanka born in Australia. There are 73,849 Australians (0.4 of the population) who reported having Sinhalese ancestry in 2006. The Sinhalese language was also reported to be the 29th-fastest-growing language in Australia (ranking above Somali language but behind Hindi language and Belarusian language). Sinhalese Australians have an exceptionally low rate of return migration to Sri Lanka. In the Canada 2011 Census, 7,220 people identified themselves as of Sri Lankan Canadians, out of 139,415 Sri Lankans. There are a small amount of Sri Lankans in India, scattered around the country, but mainly living in and around the North India and South India regions. Sri Lankan New Zealanders comprised 3% of the Asian population of New Zealand in 2001. The numbers arriving continued to increase, and at the 2006 census there were over 7,000 Sri Lankans living in New Zealand. The Sri Lankan American number about 12,000 in the U.S. The New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest Sri Lankan community in the United States, receiving the highest legal permanent resident Sri Lankan immigrant population, followed by Central New Jersey and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Many Sri Lankans in Italy have migrated to Italy since the 1970s. Italy was attractive to the Sinhalese due to perceived easier employment opportunities and entry, compared to other European countries. It is estimated that there are 30,000-33,000 Sinhalese in Italy. The major Sinhalese communities in Italy are located in Lombardia (In the districts Loreto and Lazzaretto), Milan, Lazio, Rome, Naples, and Southern Italy (Particularly Palermo, Messina and Catania). Though British Sri Lankans people in particular and Sri Lankans in general have migrated to the UK over the centuries beginning from the colonial times, the number of Sinhalese people in the UK cannot be estimated accurately due to inadequacies of census in the UK.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family.

Question: Wesker believes that doing what will pacify the T-virus? Movie plot title: Resident Evil: Afterlife Movie plot: The Alice clones (Milla Jovovich) attack Umbrella HQ, Tokyo, slaying the entire branch except for Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who escapes in a tiltrotor plane and detonates a bomb that leaves a massive sinkhole; however, the real Alice boarded beforehand. Wesker injects her with Anti-Virus before the autopilot crashes the plane. Only Alice survives. Months later, Alice travels to Alaska in an airplane, tracking broadcasts from a safe haven called Arcadia; however, she only finds abandoned planes, and is attacked by feral Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of L.A., where they find survivors living in a prison surrounded by infected. They meet Luther West (Boris Kodjoe), Wendell (Fulvio Cecere), Crystal Waters (Kacey Barnfield), Bennett (Kim Coates), Kim Yong (Norman Yeung), and Angel Ortiz (Sergio Peris-Mencheta). With their help, Alice lands on the prison's roof and learns Arcadia isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no-one from it has responded to the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, Chris (Wentworth Miller), who insists he's falsely imprisoned, and will reveal an escape route for freedom. Alice goes to the showers to wash up, but catches Wendell attempting to peep. They are attacked by a group of infected that dug into the prison, and take Wendell; she manages to kill them. Desperate, they free Chris, who reveals Claire's his sister, and the prison has an armored car they can use to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins breaking down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine and it would take a week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for Arcadia in Alice's airplane. The Axeman breaks down the gate,...

Clyde Austin \\"The Glide\\" Drexler (born June 22, 1962) is an American retired professional basketball player. During his career, he was a ten-time All-Star, and named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. Drexler won an Olympic gold medal in 1992 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\\"The Dream Team\\") and an NBA Championship in 1995 with the Houston Rockets. He is a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee (being inducted 2004 for his individual career, and in 2010 as a member of the \\"Dream Team\\") On February 14, 1995, with the Blazers out of serious contention for a championship, Portland honored Drexler's request to be traded to a contender and sent the Blazer great back home to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Otis Thorpe in mid-season, right before the trade deadline. Despite finishing the regular season with a record of 47-35, which placed the Rockets 6th out of 8 playoff teams in the Western Conference, Drexler and long-time friend Hakeem Olajuwon helped propel them to an improbable second consecutive championship in 1995, sweeping the Orlando Magic. In his third and final NBA Finals appearance, Drexler averaged 21.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game. During the 1995 NBA Playoffs, Drexler was ejected during a game between the Rockets and the Phoenix Suns by referee Jake O'Donnell, which allegedly stemmed from a personal feud between the two at the time. This would turn out to be the last NBA game O'Donnell would referee, as he was not assigned any further games in the playoffs that year, and eventually retired a few months later. In 1996, on ESPN's NBA Today, O'Donnell commented, \\"I wouldn't give Clyde Drexler much leeway because of the way he reacted with me all the time. I thought at times he would give cheap shots to people, and I just would not allow it.\\" On February 13, 2009, Drexler participated in the NBA All-Star Weekend's Celebrity Game.

Navigating the ups and downs of the industry, Ray must balance the pressures of his work with his passion for innovation and design. However, his life changes forever when he stumbles upon a set of blueprints that hold the key to making an architectural masterpiece which could redefine the skyline of the city. Act 1: Ray is introduced as a hard-working, down-to-earth construction worker who takes pride in his occupation. He works alongside his long-time friends and colleagues and boasts a strong bond with them. In his free time, Ray is a passionate architect who dreams of designing a skyscraper that will make a lasting impact on the skyline. One day, Ray finds a rolled-up set of blueprints hidden in a corner of the construction site. Intrigued, he takes them home to study, only to discover that they contain plans for an incredible skyscraper unlike any other in existence. His excitement turns into obsession as he spends countless hours making adjustments and enhancements to the design. Act 2: As Ray becomes increasingly fixated on the blueprints, his work performance at the construction site begins to suffer. His friends and colleagues notice the change in his behavior, but he remains tight-lipped about his secret discovery. To make matters worse, Ray learns that a rival construction company is vying to purchase the land where he believes the groundbreaking tower could be built. Determined not to let the opportunity slip away, Ray tries to pitch his idea to the construction company's owner. However, he's dismissed and ridiculed due to his lack of formal architectural education. Refusing to give up, Ray enlists the help of a gifted young architect named Chloe, who shares his vision for the project and offers to present it under her name. Act 3: As Chloe and Ray work together to perfect their design, they form a strong connection and ultimately fall in love. At the same time, Ray's colleagues rally behind him, sensing that his secret project is something extraordinary that could change their lives. Together, they decide to enter the design in a prestigious architectural competition that carries a cash prize large enough to secure the land for construction. In the final act, Ray's former boss - who had initially dismissed his ideas - sees their skyscraper project presentation, and is awestruck by the innovative design. Despite the intense competition, Ray and Chloe's skyscraper wins the contest. The construction team celebrates their victory and begins the process of realizing Ray's dream, constructing the one-of-a-kind tower that will forever alter the city's iconic skyline. As the construction of the skyscraper commences, Ray and Chloe's relationship continues to flourish, and the team becomes a symbol of hope and perseverance to thousands - proving that ordinary people can indeed achieve extraordinary dreams."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Not all will be saved, and perhaps not all deserve to be saved. There are low-quality schools just as there are low-quality businesses. We have no duty to save them simply because they exist. But many promising institutions that deserve to continue are threatened. They are doing a fine job educationally, but they are caught in a financial squeeze, with no way to reduce rising cost or increase income significantly. Raising tuition doesn't bring in more income, for each time tuition goes up, the enrollment goes down, or the amount that must be given away in student aid goes up. Schools are bad businesses, whether public or private, not usually because of mismanagement but because of the nature of the enterprise. They lose money on every customer, and they can go bankrupt either from too few students or too many students. Even a very good college is a very bad business. It is such colleges, promising but threatened, that I worry about. Low enrollment is not their chief problem. Even with full enrollment, they may _ . Efforts to save them, and preferably to keep them private, are a national necessity. There is no basis for arguing that private schools are inherently better than public schools. There are many examples to the contrary. Anyone can name state universities and colleges that rank as the finest in the nation and the world. It is now inevitable that public institutions will be dominant, and therefore diversity is a national necessity. Diversity in the way we support schools tends to give us a healthy diversity in the forms of education. In an imperfect society such as ours, uniformity of education throughout the nation could be dangerous, In an imperfect society, diversity is a positive good. Supporters of public higher education know the importance of sustaining private higher education.

He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the painting that was completed in 1896 and presented to Patriarch Gerogije later that year? Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements.

Question: Who picks up David at the crime scene? Title: Wonderland Movie plot: John Holmes and Dawn SchillerLos Angeles, June 29, 1981. We are first introduced to the teenage girlfriend of legengary porn actor John Holmes - the underage Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth). She is on the streets and is picked up by a holy roller named Sally (Carrie Fisher) after she and Holmes break up. She eventually calls Holmes to come and get her. Holmes (Val Kilmer) arrives at the apartment and they have sex and snort cocaine in the bathroom before being discoverd and flee the holy roller's house.After a 'drug-run' to a house located on Wonderland Avenue in the wooded Laurel Canyon neighborhood, Holmes and Dawn check into a motel where they both get high from snorting more cocaine and freebasing. The next morning (June 30), Holmes leaves Dawn to travel to an answering service in Santa Monica to check his phone messages and mail where he has it sent, leaving Dawn alone in the motel room with her pet dog to keep her company. He tells her that he will return in a few hours, but Holmes does not return. During the night, Dawn is woken up by a disturbing vision of violence. The next morning, (July 1) Dawn continues to remain alone the whole day.While watching TV of the late afternoon news, Dawn sees a newscast that states four people were murdered at a rowhouse on Wonderland Avenue in Laurel Canyon, the same one she had been to with Holmes the day before. Shortly thereafter, Holmes finally arrives back at the motel room, looking tired and dishevelded, and wearing different clothes then when he left two days prior. He does not want to talk about where he was and instead takes a valum pill and goes right to sleep.The story eventually moves onto two city detectives, Nico and Cruz (Ted Levine and Franky G), investigating the crime scene and their contact with Holmes.

Q:What is the missing first step of the following process: - Cells with chlorophyll in them capture the light energy - Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stoma - Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts of themselves - Plants absorb minerals through their roots - Plants convert these inputs into sugars - Sugars can be used as energy sources - Oxygen and water are also produced - Excess water and oxygen are released through stoma and other parts of the plant. A:","completion":"A: The missing first step of the following process is the process of photosynthesis, which is the fundamental mechanism through which plants produce their own food. Photosynthesis enables plants to capture and convert the energy from sunlight into glucose (sugar), which can then be used as an energy source to support plant growth and development. The detailed explanation for this complex process can be provided as follows: 1. Photosynthesis Process Initiation: The first step is triggered by the presence of chlorophyll, a pigment that allows the plant to absorb and capture the sunlight energy. Chlorophyll is found in organelles called chloroplasts, which are present in plant cells. 2. Light Energy Capture: Cells with chlorophyll in them capture the light energy, which is a vital component for the process of photosynthesis to occur. 3. Carbon Dioxide Absorption: Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their stomata, small openings located mainly on the undersides of leaves. 4. Water Absorption: Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts of themselves. This water is essential for the process of photosynthesis. 5. Mineral Absorption: In addition to water, plants also absorb essential minerals from the soil through their roots, which play crucial roles in various biochemical processes, including photosynthesis. 6. Conversion to Sugars: With the combination of light energy, carbon dioxide, water, and minerals, plants are able to convert these inputs into sugars, such as glucose, through a series of chemical reactions. 7. Energy Source Utilization: The sugars produced through photosynthesis can be used as energy sources to fuel plant growth, maintenance, and reproduction. 8. Oxygen and Water Production: In addition to sugars, photosynthesis results in the production of oxygen and water as byproducts. 9. Excretion of Excess Water and Oxygen: Excess water and oxygen are released through stoma and other parts of the plant, allowing the plant to maintain an optimal balance of these substances while continuing the process of photosynthesis. In summary, the missing first step in the given process is the initiation of photosynthesis, which encompasses all the subsequent steps and allows plants to convert light energy into sugars and other essential substances for their growth and development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: A year after the song was published Dresser's brother Theodore, who later became a famous novelist, privately claimed to have authored its lyrics. In 1917, after Dresser's 1906 death, Theodore made his controversial claim public in a newspaper article. Already a controversial figure because of his open support for communism and tendency to make negative comments about his home state, Theodore's claims were ridiculed in many papers and by prominent Hoosiers who dismissed it as a hoax. Although Theodore never retracted his assertion that he wrote the first verse and chorus of the song, he downplayed the importance of his alleged contribution in later years. It is possible that Theodore did give his brother the idea for the song, and may have even authored a portion of the lyrics, some of which reflect his writing style. The line stating \\"where I first received my lessons, nature's school\\" is a possible link, reflecting Theodore's obsession with nature during his youth and his belief that it held the answers to life, a topic he wrote of on several occasions.Dresser died penniless after his publishing business failed. Known for his generosity, he also had a tendency to overspend and give money to his friends and family. In addition, copyrights to Dresser's music were poorly managed after the Haviland and Dresser Company went bankrupt in 1905. Maurice Richmond Music, who purchased the bankrupt company's copyrights, gave Ballard MacDonald and James Hanley permission to use two bars from Dresser's ballad in a song they published in 1917.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Remember former Republican legislator Charlie Fuqua, running again for legislature with financial support from the Arkansas Republican Party and U.S. Reps. Tim Griffin and Steve Womack, among others? We've mentioned some excerpts from his book, \\"God's Law: The Only Political Solution.\\" I have more for you today. To save space, I've omitted the Biblical citation for Fuqua's endorsement of the death penalty for rebellious children. Fuqua doesn't think execution would have to be used often on children who defied their parents, but suggests the deterrent effect of its legality would be beneficial. Verbatim, from the writing of Charlie Fuqua, a former lawyer for the Arkansas Department of Human Services: The maintenance of civil order in society rests on the foundation of family discipline. Therefore, a child who disrespects his parents must be permanently removed from society in a way that gives an example to all other children of the importance of respect for parents. The death penalty for rebellioius children is not something to be taken lightly. The guidelines for administering the death penalty to rebellious children are given in Deut 21:18-21: … This passage does not give parents blanket authority to kill their children. They must follow the proper procedure in order to have the death penalty executed against their children. I cannot think of one instance in the Scripture where parents had their child put to death. Why is this so? Other than the love Christ has for us, there is no greater love then [sic] that of a parent for their child. The last people who would want to see a child put to death would be the parents of the child. Even so, the Scrpture provides a safe guard to protect children from parents who would wrongly exercise the death penalty against them. Parents are required to bring their children to the gate of the city. The gate of the city was the place where the elders of the city met and made judicial pronouncements. In other words, the parents were required to take their children to a court of law and lay out their case before the proper judicial authority, and let the judicial authority determine if the child should be put to death. I know of many cases of rebellious children, however, I cannot think of one case where I believe that a parent had given up on their child to the point that they would have taken their child to a court of law and asked the court to rule that the child be put to death. Even though this procedure would rarely be used, if it were the law of land, it would give parents authority. Children would know that their parents had authority and it would be a tremendous incentive for children to give proper respect to their parents. To date, Congressman Griffin and Republican Party Chair Doyle Webb have criticized some of the things Fuqua has said. Womack has said nothing. But no party official has demanded money back or urged Fuqua to withdraw from the race. Majority control of the legislature is far too important for Republicans to abandon a candidate, no matter how extreme. Which tells you a little something about Republican majority governance. Still waiting for Republican leadership, too, on the question of endorsement of sitting Republican Rep. Loy Mauch of Bismarck, who we've quoted repeatedly in defense of slavery and harshly critical of GOP patron saint Abraham Lincoln. Mauch scorns Lincoln as a Nazi and Marxist. The Republican representative is a follower of the neo-Confederate League of the South. Republican officials also haven't pulled endorsements and financial support for slavery apologist Republican Rep. Jon Hubbard of Jonesboro. UPDATE: Columnist John Brummett asked U.S. Rep. Tim Griffin if he'd like to add Loy Mauch to his list of regretted campaign contributions (to be distinguished from withdrawal of party endorsement). He got this response ( pay wall ; apparently it isn't pay feature): The congressman wrote back, “I read a sample of Rep. Mauch’s statements, and they range from outrageous to historically inaccurate and anachronistic to downright odd. As we all know, both parties have folks that say ridiculous things, but I would not have financially supported Mauch had I known about these statements. And yes I am requesting that he give the money to charity.” Note the weasel words \\"financially supported.\\" Griffin presumably would vote for Mauch over Jesus, were Jesus to run in the party to which his philosophy is most naturally inclined these days, the Democrats. Of course, as Mauch tells us, Jesus condoned slavery, too. UPDATE II: U.S. Rep. Steve Womack's staff, which normally ignores requests for information from the Arkansas Times, hastened to volunteer that they HAD made a statement about Hubbard and Fuqua, but not Mauch: I am disheartened by Jon Hubbard and Charlie Fuqua's recent statements and do not support or agree with their views. Offering donations to their campaigns—and to all other Republican candidates seeking office in the Arkansas Legislature this fall—should not suggest otherwise. In light of their new agreeability I've asked two followups: 1) what about Loy Mauch? and 2) does the congressman urge votes for these candidates despite their pronouncements? A campaign spokesman responded to Question 1, but not Question 2 (which is an answer in itself): The congressman does not support the comments made by Mr. Mauch in the least. UPDATE III: Congressmen Griffin and Womack, this is the more appropriate statement, Twittered this morning by Republican Sen. Davy Carter: I am proud to endorse Rep. James McLean for State Rep. Dist. #63. It has been an honor to work with James the past four years, and I look... McLean is Fuqua's Democratic opponent. Carter would earn Hall of Fame status if he endorsed Harold Copenhaver, who's opposing Hubbard, or David Kizzia, who's opposing Mauch. Neither of them are legislative colleagues, but a stump would be better in either case. UPDATE IV: When I did my rundown early Saturday morning of Republican Party contributions to extremist candidates, Fuqua had not filed his latest campaign report. It came on-line yesterday. Add as financial supporters: * House Republican Leadership PAC — 2,000. * Independence County Republican Party — 500 * Michelle and former Republican legislator Jim Bob Duggar — 250.

Arkansas Republicans are speaking out against \\"offensive\\" statements by a GOP state representative who... (Associated Press) The claims were made in books written, respectively, by Rep. Jon Hubbard of Jonesboro and House candidate Charlie Fuqua of Batesville. Those books received attention on Internet news sites Friday. On Saturday, state GOP Chairman Doyle Webb called the books \\"highly offensive.\\" And U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, a Republican who represents northeast Arkansas, called the writings \\"divisive and racially inflammatory.\\" Hubbard wrote in his 2009 self-published book, \\"Letters To The Editor: Confessions Of A Frustrated Conservative,\\" that \\"the institution of slavery that the black race has long believed to be an abomination upon its people may actually have been a blessing in disguise.\\" He also wrote that African-Americans were better off than they would have been had they not been captured and shipped to the United States. Fuqua, who served in the Arkansas House from 1996 to 1998, wrote there is \\"no solution to the Muslim problem short of expelling all followers of the religion from the United States,\\" in his 2012 book, titled \\"God's Law.\\" Fuqua said Saturday that he hadn't realized he'd become a target within his own party, which he said surprised him. \\"I think my views are fairly well-accepted by most people,\\" Fuqua said before hanging up, saying he was busy knocking on voters' doors. The attorney is running against incumbent Democratic Rep. James McLean in House District 63. Hubbard, a marketing representative, didn't return voicemail messages seeking comment Saturday. He is running against Democrat Harold Copenhaver in House District 58. The November elections could be a crucial turning point in Arkansas politics. Democrats hold narrow majorities in both chambers, but the GOP has been working hard to swing the Legislature its way for the first time since the end of the Civil War, buoyed by picking up three congressional seats in 2010. Their efforts have also been backed by an influx of money from national conservative groups. Rep. Crawford said Saturday he was \\"disappointed and disturbed.\\" \\"The statements that have been reported portray attitudes and beliefs that would return our state and country to a harmful and regrettable past,\\" Crawford said. U.S. Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., kicked off the GOP's response Saturday by issuing a release, saying the \\"statements of Hubbard and Fuqua are ridiculous, outrageous and have no place in the civil discourse of either party.\\" \\"Had I known of these statements, I would not have contributed to their campaigns. I am requesting that they give my contributions to charity,\\" said Griffin, who donated 100 to each candidate. The Arkansas Republican House Caucus followed, saying the views of Hubbard and Fuqua \\"are in no way reflective of, or endorsed by, the Republican caucus. The constituencies they are seeking to represent will ultimately judge these statements at the ballot box.\\" Then Webb, who has spearheaded the party's attempt to control the Legislature, said the writings \\"were highly offensive to many Americans and do not reflect the viewpoints of the Republican Party of Arkansas. While we respect their right to freedom of expression and thought, we strongly disagree with those ideas.\\" Webb, though, accused state Democrats of using the issue as a distraction. Democrats themselves have been largely silent, aside from the state party's tweet and Facebook post calling attention to the writings. A Democratic Party spokesman didn't immediately return a call for comment Saturday. The two candidates share other political and religious views on their campaign websites.

Please answer the following question: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: when did canada gain their independence from britain?","completion":"Canada gained its independence from Britain through a gradual process that took place over several years. The journey towards independence was marked by milestones such as the enactment of the British North America Act (BNA Act) in 1867, the Statute of Westminster in 1931, and the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982. Here is an overview of this process: 1. British North America Act (1867): Also known as the Constitution Act, 1867, the BNA Act marked the beginning of the Confederation of Canada. The act united the British colonies of Canada (which were separated into two provinces, Ontario and Quebec), Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into a single Dominion of Canada, with a federal system of government. This was the first step towards Canadian independence, as the new nation was granted the right to self-govern in domestic matters. However, Britain retained legislative control over certain aspects of governance, such as foreign policy and constitutional amendments. 2. Statute of Westminster (1931): The Statute of Westminster was a significant milestone in asserting Canada's legislative independence from Britain. Until this point, Canadian laws were subject to British approval, as were those of several other self-governing dominions within the British Empire. The Statute of Westminster changed this by granting these dominions full legal freedom, equal to that of the United Kingdom. While the British Parliament could still enact laws relating to the dominions, it could do so only at the request and with the consent of the respective dominion. This statute provided Canada with more control over its affairs, such as foreign policy and defense. 3. Patriation of the Canadian Constitution (1982): Before the patriation of the Canadian Constitution, Britain continued to maintain some control over Canada's constitutional framework. Any amendments to the BNA Act required the approval of the British Parliament, as it was still an act of their legislature. This changed in 1982, when the Canadian Constitution was patriated, thereby bringing it entirely under Canadian jurisdiction. The repatriation process involved the passing of the Canada Act 1982 by the British Parliament and the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, by the Canadian Parliament. The Constitution Act, 1982, included the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which serves as the fundamental law of the country and outlines various civil rights and liberties. It also established a framework for constitutional amendments, eliminating the need for Canadian requests to the British Parliament. In conclusion, while it is convenient to look for a specific date or event to signify Canada's independence from Britain, it is important to understand that the process was gradual and involved a series of milestones. These milestones, namely the British North America Act in 1867, the Statute of Westminster in 1931, and the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982, highlight the process of gaining political autonomy and developing a distinct Canadian identity separate from that of Britain."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Kirina is approached by Kinjo and two ninjas. Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, but Kinjo was not among them. The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving Kinjo motivation to kill Paul and Takeda. On the island, Paul spends time with the drunken blacksmith Oshima, who is constructing a sword for Takeda, and the old man teaches him about smithing and swordsmanship. Mieko explains the history of the two clans' conflict and the samurai concepts of courage and honor.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Walt Whitman was born in 1819 in Long Island, New York. Whitman received most of his education outside of the classroom. At the age of eleven, he worked in a law office as an office boy where he became interested in reading. He was soon reading the works of famous authors like William Shakespeare and Homer, and was well on his way to becoming one of America's most well-known poets. By the time Whitman was seventeen years old, he had already worked as a printer's learner, a worker, and a learning games to help his students with spelling and maths. In his early twenties, however, he gave up teaching to pursue a full-time career as a journalist and poet. When Walt Whitman first appeared as a poet, his arrival onto the American literary scene was met with controversy. His first collection of poems, Leaves of Grass, was so unusual that no commercial publisher would print the work. In 1855 Whitman published, at his own expense, the first edition of his collection of twelve poems. Whitman's poetic style was uncommon I the sense that he wrote poems in a form called parallelism , in which his goal was to copy the flow of the sea and the quickly-passing nature of human emotion. A common theme in Whitman's poetry is self-realization. In his work, Whitman moves from conventional patterns of rhyme to create a unique rhythm and a multi-layered, but truly American voice. \\"Although Whitman was considered a revolutionary by many, there is little doubt he loved his country deeply.\\" In his writing, he used slang and various images, or voices, to create a sense of national unity. For Whitman, the \\"proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.\\" Whitman has undoubtedly become a part of the cultural history and image of America.

The shoemaker agreed and told the man that they would be ready on Thursday. However, the man received a job offer in another country and left without collecting his shoes. Twenty years later, the man returned to his hometown and decided to visit the shoemaker to find out if his shoes were still there or not. He explained to the shoemaker that he had left a pair of shoes for repair twenty years ago and asked if they were still in the shop. The shoemaker asked for the man's name, and upon hearing it was Smith, he went to the back of the shop to look for the shoes. After a few minutes, he returned with a pair of brown shoes. The shoemaker then told the man, \\"Here they are. One pair of brown shoes. I'm a bit busy now, but they'll be ready on Thursday.\\" This response indicated that although the shoes were still at the shop, the shoemaker had not repaired them. After twenty years, the shoemaker still had not completed the repair as he remained busy with other work. This situation shows that option A is the correct answer – his shoes were still there, but the shoemaker didn't repair them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1895 - October 26, 1952) was an American stage actress, professional singer-songwriter, and comedian. She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. In August, 1950, McDaniel suffered a heart ailment and entered Temple Hospital in semi-critical condition. She was released in October to recuperate at home, and she was cited by United Press on Jan. 3, 1951, as showing \\"slight improvement in her recovery from a mild stroke.\\" McDaniel died of breast cancer at age 57 on October 26, 1952, in the hospital on the grounds of the Motion Picture House in Woodland Hills, California. She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel. Thousands of mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements. In her will, McDaniel wrote, \\"I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias in my hair and in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses. I also wish to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery\\"; Hollywood Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, is the resting place of movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Its owner at the time, Jules Roth, refused to allow her to be buried there, because, at the time of McDaniel's death, the cemetery practiced racial segregation and would not accept the remains of black people for burial. Her second choice was Rosedale Cemetery (now known as Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery), where she lies today. In 1999, Tyler Cassidy, the new owner of the Hollywood Cemetery (renamed the Hollywood Forever Cemetery), offered to have McDaniel re-interred there. Her family did not wish to disturb her remains and declined the offer. Instead, Hollywood Forever Cemetery built a large cenotaph on the lawn overlooking its lake. It is one of Hollywood's most popular tourist attractions. McDaniel's last will and testament of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, where she had been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions in that day preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed. Despite evidence McDaniel had earned an excellent income as an actress, her final estate was less than 10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than 11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in a glass case in the university's drama department. Did Hattie end up being buried in Hollywood Cemetery?","completion":"No, Hattie McDaniel was not buried in the Hollywood Cemetery. After her death in 1952, the owner of Hollywood Cemetery, Jules Roth, refused to allow her to be buried there due to the cemetery's practice of racial segregation at that time.

We investigated whether cytochrome c release participated in SMC death induced by 7-ketocholesterol and whether the processes were reversible.', 'SMC cultures derived from the rabbit aorta were exposed to 25 microM 7-ketocholesterol. Cytochrome c and Bax were studied by means of immunofluorescence and immunoblotting, apoptosis by the TUNEL technique and mitochondrial structure by transmission electron microscopy.', '7-Ketocholesterol induced rapid upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bax and its translocation from cytosol into the mitochondria (4 h). This was followed by mitochondrial cytochrome c release (65% at 8 h) into the cytosol, which was almost complete at 16 h. The mitochondria became spherical and ultracondensed, without showing signs of lysis. They clustered around the nucleus and were wrapped by wide cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Cytochrome c release was not blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, in contrast to DNA fragmentation and SMC loss. Interestingly, upon removal of 7-ketocholesterol after 16 h and re-exposure to serum for 24 h, the mitochondrial cytochrome c content, their transmembrane potential and TUNEL labelling normalised and SMC loss decreased. However, none of these cell death markers was rescued when the SMCs had been exposed to the oxysterol for 24 h.","completion":"What happens to the mitochondrial structure after being exposed to 7-Ketocholesterol for 8 hours?"},{"prompt":"Q:Dialogue: Daniel: Hey, Ashley.

The game is the culmination to a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season. The next game, Super Bowl LI, scheduled for February 5, 2017, will follow the 2016 regular season. - The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football franchise based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In his book about psychedelic music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley Smile as a work of the \\"ultimate psychedelic rock library\\". Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice...

The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Input: Passage: Black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.As of 2017, an estimated 700 grizzly bears were living in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with about 150 grizzlies living wholly or partially within Yellowstone National Park. The grizzly was initially listed as a threatened species in the contiguous United States on July 28, 1975 by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The grizzly bear was taken off the endangered species list in 2007. Opponents of delisting the grizzly expressed concerns that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures were needed to ensure a sustainable population. A federal district judge overturned the delisting ruling in 2009, reinstating the grizzly; however, the grizzly was once again removed from the list in 2017. In September 2018, a US district judge ruled that the grizzly's protections must be restored in full, arguing the Fish and Wildlife Service was mistaken in removing the bear from the threatened status list. Regardless of the rulings, hunting is prohibited within Yellowstone National Park. Hunters who legally hunt animals outside park boundaries may transport the carcass through the park with a permit. Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000—the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid‑1990s; this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the National Elk Refuge, immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.

The qloja machines are designed with advanced technology that allows users to experience a whole new way of moving, providing both comfort and efficiency. As they take their first few steps, many users are initially cautious, unsure of how to balance and adjust their stride to accommodate the unique sensation. But soon, they become more confident and realize that the qloja machines intuitively adapt to their movements, making their walking experience smoother and more enjoyable. As the users walk, they notice that the weight of their bodies seems to be distributed evenly across their entire foot, alleviating pressure points and reducing fatigue. The qloja machines not only assist in walking, but also help to improve posture and correct any imbalances that may be present. With every step, the users feel their leg muscles being gently engaged, providing a low-impact workout that can greatly benefit individuals with joint or mobility issues. The qloja machines are equipped with various sensors that can detect changes in terrain and adjust accordingly to maintain a consistent and comfortable walking experience. Downhill slopes and uneven surfaces are no longer a problem, as the devices automatically adapt to provide optimum support and cushioning. Even on surfaces that typically cause discomfort or difficulty, such as sand or gravel, the qloja machines can navigate with ease. In addition to providing physical benefits, the qloja machines also have a positive impact on mental well-being. As users walk, they can enjoy the freedom of movement without the usual strains and stresses on their joints and muscles, allowing them to better appreciate the beauty of their surroundings and feel more connected with their environment. Furthermore, the qloja machines' advanced technology includes an array of customizable settings, allowing users to fine-tune their walking experience to suit their individual preferences. For instance, those who prefer a more buoyant stride can adjust the device's settings to increase the feeling of walking on air, while others can opt for a more grounded experience that still provides the benefits of reduced strain and improved posture. As people continue to explore the potential of the qloja machines, they begin to dream of new possibilities and applications for this breakthrough technology. From hiking to dancing, these devices open a world of opportunities for individuals who would have previously been limited by physical constraints. The qloja machines are not just a means of transportation, but rather a key to unlocking the human potential for mobility and innovation."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Context_1 : Can Live Music (Live 1971–1977) is a double live album by the band Can, released in 1999 and recorded in the UK and West Germany between 1972 and 1977 (despite the title referencing 1971). It originally came as an item in the now out of print Can box set. Context_2 : Zips (also Siggies or Geeps) is a slang term often used as a derogatory slur by Italian American and Sicilian American mobsters in reference to newer immigrant Sicilian and Italian mafiosi. The name is said to have originated from mobsters' inability to understand the faster-speaking Sicilian dialects, which appeared to \\"zip\\" by. Other theories include pejorative uses such as Sicilians' preference for silent, homemade zip guns. According to still another theory, the term is a contraction of the Sicilian slang term for \\"hicks\\" or \\"primitives.\\" The older Sicilian mafiosi of pre-Prohibition known as \\"Mustache Petes\\" (who eventually were deposed by American-born mobsters during the Castellammarese War) were also referred to as zips. Context_3 : Shiv (possibly from the Romani word \\"chivomengro\\", \\"knife\\"), also \\"chiv\\", is a slang term for any sharp or pointed implement used as a knife-like weapon. The \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" suggests \\"shive\\", a razor, documented in 1915, as the root word. In the 1920s, \\"shiv\\" was also a common slang term for a bladed weapon, mostly a knife. In the United States, an improvised prison knife is also often called a shank. Context_4 : Shmohawk or schmohawk is a slang term that might have derived from \\"schmo\\", a slang term meaning \\"fool\\". The HBO television show \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" gave the word recent notoriety, and HBO even sells a \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" schmohawk mug. Earlier uses of the word can be found in the \\"Crusader Rabbit\\" animated cartoon \\"Crusader and the Schmohawk Indians\\", released in 1950 and in Saul Bellow's 1958 novel \\"Henderson the Rain King\\". Context_5 : Ghosts is a 2006 drama film directed by Nick Broomfield, based on the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster. The title is a reference to the Cantonese slang term \\"Gweilo\\" (鬼佬), meaning \\"ghost man\\", used for white people. Context_6 : Dongo may refer to: The mix between a dingo and any other dog is referred to as a \\"Dongo\\" and also is a slang term for male genitalia. Dongo is also reported to be, but is not widely used, as a slang term in Australia as a substitute for the color orange. Context_7 : Nose, Iranian Style is a 2005 Iranian documentary film directed by Mehrdad Oskouei. It is about nose jobs (rhinoplasty) in Iran, which statistically has the most of any country. The documentary employs a semi-comedic tone, with the title referencing the earlier film \\"Divorce, Iranian Style\\". \\"Nose, Iranian Style\\" relates the trend to politics, with it and the 2007 documentary \\"\\" connecting it to the importance of appearance, given the taboo of men and women directly and socially interacting. However, Oskouei said the film was truly a critique of excessive consumerism. Context_8 : Gweilo or gwailou (, pronounced ] ) is a common Cantonese slang term for Westerners. In its unmodified form, it applies only to European ethnicities and has a history of racially deprecatory use. Cantonese speakers frequently use \\"gwailou\\" to refer to Westerners in general use, in a non-derogatory context, although whether this type of usage is offensive is disputed by both Cantonese and Westerners alike. Context_9 : Beard is a slang term describing a person who is used, knowingly or unknowingly, as a date, romantic partner (boyfriend or girlfriend), or spouse either to conceal infidelity or to conceal one's sexual orientation. The American slang term originally referred to anyone who acted on behalf of another, in any transaction, to conceal a person's true identity. The term can be used in heterosexual and homosexual contexts, but is especially used within LGBT culture. References to beards are seen in mainstream television and films, and other entertainment.

Quintessentially British: glass designer Geoffrey Baxter In last week’s article I looked back to see how in 1834, three years before Queen Victoria ascended the throne, an entrepreneurial wine merchant, James Powell, purchased Whitefriars, a relatively obscure 17th-century London glassworks, and how over the following 100 years he and his descendants, as James Powell & Sons, transformed it into a decorative glass manufacturer of international standing. This week I want to focus on how the company (which changed its name back to Whitefriars Glass Ltd, in 1962) revived former glories after the severe economic downturn of the Second World War, and how Geoffrey Baxter, a Royal College of Art graduate who joined the firm in 1954, became one of the leading players in post-war British design. Some of the stylistic groundwork for Baxter’s now much sought-designs was laid down in the late 1930s in Scandinavia, where companies such as Orrefors, in Sweden, began to produce new, organically shaped pieces that were to prove such a success in the post-war Europe of the late 1940s and 1950s. This Soft Modern style was initially taken up at Whitefriars by designer James Hogan, just before the war, and then after it by chief designer and managing director William Wilson. When Baxter joined much of his initial output, in the form of coloured (often two-tone) cased and mould-blown pieces, displayed the smooth, clean, organic lines characteristic of contemporary Scandinavian design. However, during the 1960s he began to develop his own highly distinctive style. As before, nature provided much of the inspiration, but now organic texture rather than organic shape became the focus. Baxter experimented with numerous methods of producing texture – including lining the glass moulds with materials as diverse as tree bark, bricks, copper wire, and nail heads – and most proved highly effective, as the illustrated examples reveal. They also convey Baxter’s equally distinctive use of colour. You should note that some colours are more desirable to current collectors than others. For example, as a rule-of-thumb Tangerine commands a quarter to a third the price of, Aubergine and Pewter about half the price of, the greenish-grey coloured Willow, while pale green Meadow or vibrant Kingfisher blue will cost, in an equivalent vessel, about twice as much. However, all encapsulate not only Baxter’s individual style, but also much of the spirit of the vibrant, dynamic, pop-and-rock driven Swinging Sixties and early Seventies. It wasn’t, however, just texture and colour that defined Baxter’s style and captured the essence of the time. A third element, and the one that does most to distinguish him from his Scandinavian contemporaries, is his use of form: shapes such as Banjo, Totem, TV, Coffin, Nuts & Bolts and, above all, the amusingly asymmetrical and now iconic Drunken Bricklayer, are not only significantly less austere, more geometric, more urban, and far quirkier than their Scandinavian counterparts, they are also in these respects quintessentially British.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who volunteers because he is interested in Betsy? Answer the above question based on the context below: Travis Bickle, a 26-year-old honorably discharged U.S. Marine, is a lonely, depressed young man living in isolation in New York City. He takes a job as a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the city's boroughs. He also frequents the porn theaters on 42nd Street and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include aphorisms, such as \\"You're only as healthy as you feel.\\" Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer, as a pretext to talk to her, and takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he naively takes her to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed, so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom. Travis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city. His worldview is furthered when an adolescent prostitute and runaway, Iris, enters his taxi, attempting to escape her pimp, Sport. Sport drags Iris from the taxi and throws Travis a crumpled 20 bill, which continually reminds Travis of her and the corruption that surrounds him. A similarly influential event occurs when an unhinged passenger gloats to Travis of his intentions to murder his wife and her lover. Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent; however, Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided context, the last name of the person who volunteers because he is interested in Betsy is not mentioned explicitly. Travis Bickle is the one who becomes infatuated with Betsy and volunteers to talk to her; therefore, the last name you are seeking is Bickle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Now, I have a new situation: Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere.

Step 1: Identify the location of the ozone hole In the given background information, it is mentioned that the loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Step 2: Relate the location of the ozone hole to the research teams The Russian research team was located in Antarctica, where the ozone hole is present. The Canadian team, on the other hand, was located near the North Pole, where no ozone holes were found. Step 3: Consider the health risks associated with ozone depletion Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. Increased exposure to UV radiation, particularly due to the presence of an ozone hole, can lead to an increased risk of skin cancers and eye cataracts in humans. Step 4: Compare the exposure to UV radiation for each team As the Russian research team was in Antarctica, where the ozone hole is present, they were more exposed to higher levels of UV radiation. The Canadian team, being in a location with no ozone holes, would experience lower levels of UV radiation. Step 5: Determine which team was more exposed to skin cancers Since the Russian research team in Antarctica was more exposed to higher levels of UV radiation due to the presence of the ozone hole, they were at a greater risk of developing skin cancers as compared to the Canadian team near the North Pole, who were exposed to lower levels of UV radiation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When disaster happens, you might find yourself without water, gas and electricity. You might even need to leave your home right away. So you are supposed to plan for the bad situations before the disaster comes. Here are some suggestions: First, have a family meeting. Plan a way to get your family members together if they can't find each other after the disaster. Choose two places for everyone to go to if it isn't safe to return home. The first should be near your house. You can go there in an emergency like a fire. The second meeting place should be outside your neighborhood. Next, choose a person outside your area who can help your family get in touch with each other. After a disaster, it is often easier to communicate over a long-distance call than a local one. The person can pass messages between your family members. Then, get a family disaster _ ready. It should include things your family needs. It can help you survive at least for three days like bread, water, medicine and things like that. Put them in a bag so you can carry it if you leave in a hurry. When doing it, remember that different people have different needs. Include special things necessary for elderly or young members of your family.

Passage:DeFilippo became quarterbacks coach at Fordham in 2000 upon graduating from James Madison. The following year, DeFilippo enrolled at the University of Notre Dame to be a graduate assistant for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. In the 2001 season, DeFilippo helped coach wide receivers and tight ends on Bob Davie's staff, then in 2002 worked with quarterbacks under Tyrone Willingham. From 2003 to 2004, DeFilippo was again quarterbacks coach at a Division I-AA program in New York City, Columbia, under Bob Shoop. He then moved up to the NFL in 2005 as offensive quality control coach for the New York Giants under Tom Coughlin and held that position until 2006. In 2007, DeFilippo joined Lane Kiffin's staff on the Oakland Raiders as quarterbacks coach and remained on staff in 2008 when Tom Cable replaced Kiffin during the season. DeFilippo became quarterbacks coach for the New York Jets under Rex Ryan in 2009. The Jets that year finished 9-7 and in the playoffs, defeated the Cincinnati Bengals and San Diego Chargers to make their first trip to the AFC Championship Game in 11 years, before losing to their former division rival Indianapolis Colts 17-30.

The Jets that year finished 9-7 and in the playoffs, defeated the Cincinnati Bengals and San Diego Chargers to make their first trip to the AFC Championship Game in 11 years, before losing to their former division rival Indianapolis Colts 17-30. Explanation: This part tells us that DeFilippo joined the New York Jets as quarterbacks coach in 2009. This was the year the Jets made it to the AFC Championship Game under head coach Rex Ryan, which they lost to the Indianapolis Colts. Part #2: Identify whether the passage contains relevant information to answer the question. Usage: The passage states that the Jets made their first trip to the AFC Championship Game in 11 years in 2009.

Subsequent to these developments, Randall Collins (2004) formulated his interaction ritual theory by drawing on Durkheim's work on totemic rituals that was extended by Goffman (1964/2013; 1967) into everyday focused encounters. Based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the term for the energy not generated during group gatherings, such as totemic rituals?","completion":"The original question asks for a term referring to energy not generated during group gatherings, particularly in the context of interaction ritual theory.

Here, the scary monsters are -87*i, -1580 and -334. To find out the candies (which means solving for 'i'), we need to send the monsters away or make them happy. So, what we have to do is, move the 1580 and 334 away from the -87*i. How do we do that? We use our magic wand that can add or subtract. First, we add 1580 and 334, but remember, buddy, since they're monsters you have to make it opposite, that means instead of subtracting, we're adding them and we get 1914. But wait, we still have a monster clinging on, that's -87. We want to get rid of him too! To do that, we're going to divide our number 1914 by -87 (this is like splitting up candy evenly between friends). So, divide 1914 by -87, and we get approximately -22 (Note that it's negative because our monster was negative and hence, shared negative candies). And there you go!

His mother, who was also a country music singer, taught him how to play guitar when he was five. When he was seven years old, his mother placed him onstage to open for Loretta Lynn. His mother and father later divorced, and afterward, he moved to live with his father. Context: In December 1999, Stone was aboard an airplane which skidded off a snowy runway at O'Hare Airport in Chicago; there were no injuries. Stone began piloting ultra-light airplanes as a hobby in 1999 and 2000. In March 2000, he suffered a broken left ankle, cracked rib, concussion, and bruised kidney after crashing his plane in Robertson County, Tennessee, and was briefly hospitalized before he resumed touring. Stone later said that the accident made him decide to quit flying planes. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, rumors circulated that Stone had been on one of the hijacked planes; a spokeswoman for the singer confirmed that he was at home with his family that day. Stone signed to Audium Entertainment in 2002 and recorded The Long Way. This album included seven new songs and acoustic re-recordings of \\"More Love\\", \\"Born in the Dark\\", and \\"I'd Be Better Off\\". One of the original songs on it was \\"POW 369\\", which was later recorded by Darryl Worley. Stewart Mason thought that it was \\"not nearly as suffocatingly slick\\" as Stone's previous albums, but questioned its commercial success. His next album did not come out until 2005, when he signed to the independent label Lofton Creek Records, recording the album In a Different Light. The album included a cover of \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", which was the first single, and re-recordings of \\"In a Different Light\\" and \\"Why Didn't I Think of That\\". A second album for Lofton Creek, My Turn, followed in 2007. It was led off by the single \\"Nice Problem\\". William Ruhlmann praised this album for having \\"a timeless country feel\\", also saying that \\"Stone sings with as much fervor and sincerity as ever.\\" Ken Tucker of Billboard wrote that \\"He sounds as good as ever and his music is still relevant\\". In 2013, Stone toured with Bryan White and Shenandoah as part of the \\"Reliving the 90s Tour\\". He also returned to acting, with roles in the films When the Storm God Rides and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde. Question: What was going on with Doug in 2000?

When they play for a long time they have to stop because they do what? A. feeling happy B. get hungry C. learning D. grow up E. injury The best answer is Answer:","completion":"B. get hungry Jimmy and Tim enjoy playing together, which involves engaging in various fun activities and games. When they indulge in these physical activities for an extended period of time, they expend a considerable amount of energy. The human body needs energy to function, and it derives this energy from the nutrients it receives from the food we consume. As Jimmy and Tim continue playing, their bodies burn more calories to compensate for the energy expended. Longer periods of playtime mean higher energy consumption, which triggers a natural response within their bodies to signal the need for more fuel. This need for replenishment manifests itself as hunger. Thus, when Jimmy and Tim play for a considerable length of time, they have to stop because they get hungry. The other options provided can be excluded for the following reasons: A. Feeling happy: Although playing together may cause Jimmy and Tim to feel happy, it is not a reason for them to stop playing. In fact, their happiness would likely encourage them to continue playing. C. Learning: Although learning can be a byproduct of playing together, such as improving teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills, it is not a reason for them to stop playing. Furthermore, learning is a continuous process that happens throughout their lives. D. Grow up: Growing up is a slow and gradual process that occurs over several years. It is not an immediate event that would cause Jimmy and Tim to stop playing. E. Injury: While there is always a possibility of sustaining an injury during playtime, it is not guaranteed. It is essential to ensure that Jimmy and Tim play safely to minimize the risk of injury. Injuries are generally not an expected outcome of playing, so it is not an accurate answer in this context. Therefore, the best answer is B. get hungry, as it highlights the most reasonable reason for Jimmy and Tim to stop playing after a long period of time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Frankie Laine (born Francesco Paolo LoVecchio; March 30, 1913 - February 6, 2007) was an Italian American singer, songwriter, and actor whose career spanned 75 years, from his first concerts in 1930 with a marathon dance company to his final performance of \\"That's My Desire\\" in 2005. Often billed as \\"America's Number One Song Stylist\\", his other nicknames include \\"Mr. Rhythm\\", \\"Old Leather Lungs\\", and \\"Mr. Steel Tonsils\\". His hits included \\"That's My Desire\\", \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\", \\"Mule Train\\", \\"Cry of the Wild Goose\\", \\"A Woman In Love\\", \\"Jezebel\\", \\"High Noon\\" Even after his discovery by Carmichael, Laine still was considered only an intermission act at Billy Berg's. His next big break came when he dusted off a fifteen-year-old song that few people remembered in 1946, \\"That's My Desire\\". Laine had picked up the song from songstress June Hart a half a dozen years earlier, when he sang at the College Inn in Cleveland. He introduced \\"Desire\\" as a \\"new\\" song--meaning new to his repertoire at Berg's--but the audience mistook it for a new song that had just been written. He ended up singing it five times that night. After that, Laine quickly became the star attraction at Berg's, and record company executives took note. Laine soon had patrons lining up to hear him sing \\"Desire\\"; among them was R&B artist Hadda Brooks, known for her boogie woogie piano playing. She listened to him every night, and eventually cut her own version of the song, which became a hit on the \\"harlem\\" charts. \\"I liked the way he did it\\" Brooks recalled; \\"he sings with soul, he sings the way he feels.\\" He was soon recording for the fledgling Mercury label, and \\"That's My Desire\\" was one of the songs cut in his first recording session there. It quickly took the No. 3 spot on the R&B charts, and listeners initially thought Laine was black. It also made it to the No. 4 spot on the Mainstream charts. Although it was quickly covered by many other artists, including Sammy Kaye who took it to the No. 2 spot, it was Laine's version that became the standard. \\"Desire\\" became Laine's first Gold Record, and established him as a force in the music world. He had been over 7,000 in debt, on the day before he recorded this song.\\" His first paycheck for royalties was over five times this amount. Laine paid off all of his debts except one--fellow singer Perry Como refused to let Laine pay him back, and would kid him about the money owed for years to come. The loan to Laine during the time when both men were still struggling singers was one of the few secrets Como kept from his wife, Roselle, who learned of it many years later. A series of hit singles quickly followed, including \\"Black and Blue\\", \\"Mam'selle\\", \\"Two Loves Have I\\", \\"Shine\\", \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\", \\"Monday Again\\", and many others.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Migration Period art denotes the artwork of the Germanic peoples during the Migration period (ca. 300-900). It includes the Migration art of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the Insular art or Hiberno-Saxon art of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic fusion in the British Isles. It covers many different styles of art including the polychrome style and the animal style. In the 3rd century the Roman Empire almost collapsed and its army was becoming increasingly Germanic in make-up, so that in the 4th century when Huns pushed German tribes westward, they spilled across the Empire's borders and began to settle there. The Visigoths settled in Italy and then Spain, in the north the Franks settled into Gaul and western Germany, and in the 5th century Scandinavians such as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes invaded Britain. By the close of the 6th century the Western Roman Empire was almost completely replaced with smaller less politically organized, but vigorous, Germanic kingdoms. Although these kingdoms were never homogeneous, they shared certain common cultural features. They settled in their new lands and become farmers and fishermen. Archaeological evidence shows no tradition of monumental artwork, such as architecture or large sculpture in permanent materials, but a preference instead for \\"mobile\\" art for personal display, usually also with a practical function, such as weapons, horse harness, tools, and jewelry which fastened clothes. The surviving art of the Germanic peoples is almost entirely personal adornment, portable, and before conversion to Christianity was buried with its owner. Much art in organic materials has no doubt not survived. Three styles dominate Germanic art. The polychrome style originated with the Goths who had settled in the Black Sea area. The animal style was found in Scandinavia, north Germany and England. Finally there was Insular art or the Hiberno-Saxon style, a brief but prosperous period after Christianization that saw the fusion of animal style, Celtic, Mediterranean and other motifs and techniques.

If it does entail, answer \\"yes\\", else answer \\"no\\". sentence1:employer has advantage over employer sentence1:employer is beating employer Output:","completion":"To complete this task, I will analyze the two given sentences and determine if the second sentence logically follows or is entailed by the first sentence. Step 1: Read and understand the sentences. Sentence1: Employer has advantage over employer. (Note: There seems to be an error in this sentence as the word \\"employer\\" is repeated, so I will assume it should be \\"employee\\" for the second occurrence, making the corrected version: \\"Employer has advantage over employee.\\") Sentence2: Employer is beating employer. (Note: The word \\"employer\\" is again mistakenly repeated. I will assume the correct version should be: \\"Employer is beating employee.\\") Step 2: Analyze the meaning of each sentence. Sentence1: The employer has some sort of advantage or upper hand over the employee. Sentence2: The employer is beating the employee. This could be interpreted as the employer being better or winning in some aspect, or it could potentially imply a more literal sense of physical harm. Step 3: Compare the meaning of the two sentences and determine if Sentence2 is entailed by Sentence1. While both sentences involve the relationship between an employer and an employee and indicate some form of dominance by the employer, the extent and nature of this dominance differ. The first sentence mentions only an advantage, while the second sentence suggests a more severe form of dominance characterized by the verb \\"beating.\\" Decision: Sentence2 is not entirely entailed by Sentence1 due to the differences in the extent and nature of the employer's dominance over the employee.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

Answer the following question: Brad and Henry were two old friends in their 70's. Brad had very high levels of cholesterol, while Henry was healthier and had normal levels of cholesterol. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend takes a drug that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver? Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Brad is the friend who takes a drug that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This is because Brad has high cholesterol levels, and the drug mentioned in the hint, a statin, is designed to decrease blood cholesterol levels by inducing the expression of LDL receptors. These increased LDL receptors help remove cholesterol from the plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Process: - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"the rocks are where the oceans tides get water on them\\" happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, applying your proposed perturbation of \\"the rocks are where the oceans tides get water on them\\" would indeed affect the rate or speed at which weathering occurs, but not necessarily making it less or slower. First, it's important to note that weathering is the breaking down of rocks, soil, and minerals as well as materials through contact with the Earth's atmosphere, biota, and waters. The process you've described in your introductory question is called \\"freeze-thaw\\" or \\"frost weathering\\". It normally occurs in environments where there's a constant cycle of freezing and thawing, and it's especially effective in porous and permeable materials like rocks. Now, let's consider the scenario in your perturbation hypothesis. If the rocks are situated where ocean tides have frequent waters on them, this would have several implications for the process of weathering. 1. Increased Salt Crystal Growth: Salt water from the ocean can seep into the pores of the rocks. As the water evaporates, it leaves behind salt crystals that grow within the pores. As these salt crystals expand, it creates internal pressure in the rock which can cause it to crack and fragment. This kind of weathering is known as \\"salt crystal growth\\" or \\"haloclasty\\" and it can sometimes speed up the weathering process, not slow it down. 2. Increased Wetting and Drying: With the constant tidal action, these rocks will experience regular wetting and drying cycles. When rocks get wet, they absorb water and expand slightly, and when they dry, they contract. This repeated expansion and contraction over time can weaken the rocks causing them to crack and weather, a process more synonymous with \\"thermal stress\\". 3. Inhibition of Freeze-Thaw Weathering: However, one aspect that might slow down or reduce would be the actual freeze-thaw weathering you described earlier. Since the ocean has a moderating effect on temperature, rocks located near or at the tide line might not experience the frequent freezing and thawing cycles required for effective frost weathering. Thus, your assumed perturbation does indeed have an effect on the weathering process, but it might actually increase other forms of weathering while potentially reducing the freeze-thaw weathering. Weathering is a complicated process influenced by many factors and while certain conditions might slow one kind, they can often accelerate another. This is an area where multiple branches of science, including geology, climatology and even marine biology, intersect and contribute to the overall understanding of these processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. He is half Scottish; he owns two Scottish golf courses and was involved in a long-running legal battle over wind turbines off the Scottish coast. This is a man who gave evidence at Holyrood slamming the Scottish government's environmental policies, and engaged in a furious feud with former first minister Alex Salmond. Even in Presidential campaign mode, Mr Trump's first foreign trip as Republican nominee was to Scotland to his refurbished Trump Turnberry resort. It's fair to say he hasn't made many friends at Holyrood; every party leader has spoken out against him, and they fairly uniformly backed his rival Hillary Clinton. Here, I look at President-elect Trump's relationship with Scotland over the years. The 45th President is the (extremely) proud owner of two Scottish golf courses, at Menie and Trump Turnberry. The Aberdeenshire course was the subject of years of controversy after clashes with local residents, environmental agencies, wind farm manufacturers and council leaders. The Scottish government stepped in to give the green light to the scheme, deciding it was a project of national importance, and when it eventually opened in 2012 Mr Trump said it was \\"the greatest golf course anywhere in the world\\". But the businessman was infuriated by plans for a wind farm off the coast within view of the course, fighting the decision all the way through to the UK Supreme Court. Then in April 2014 Mr Trump bought Turnberry, one of Scotland's most famous golf courses. Never short on a rhetorical flourish, Mr Trump also suggested the new championship course might be \\"the world's best\\"; \\"the greatest canvas in all of golf\\". The President-elect was later accused of \\"blackmail\\" when he threatened to withhold Â£700m of investment from the two courses during a campaign to have him banned from entering the UK. Donald Trump appeared before Holyrood's economy, energy and environment committee in April 2012 as part of a probe into the Scottish government's green targets. The day got off to a telling start when a protestor outside the Scottish Parliament attempted to attach a balloon to the businessman's famous barnet. Inside, perhaps the most infamous exchange saw SNP member Chic Brodie ask Mr Trump if he had any evidence to support his claims about tourism, drawing the response: \\"I am the evidence\\". He also offered MSPs a stark image of a UK without wind farm subsidies: \\"Scotland, if you pursue this goal of having these monsters all over Scotland, Scotland will go broke. As sure as you are sitting there, Scotland will go broke.\\" On the whole, Mr Trump didn't offer a ringing endorsement of the Scottish government's policies. \\"From a practical standpoint, I think that your CO2 targets are absolutely ridiculous,\\" he said. \\"Here you are, destroying the financial wellbeing of Scotland to meet phoney and totally random CO2 targets, and a country that is making your turbines - by the way, China loves making turbines for Scotland and getting Scotland to pay it a lot of money - is doing so much damage to the atmosphere that there is nothing at all that you can do to bring it back through your so-called wind initiative.\\" Mr Trump and his team clashed in particular with Green MSP Patrick Harvie, who was subsequently terrifically proud to have been the subject of a complaint from the billionaire. Hard feelings clearly remain, with Mr Harvie dismissing the newly-elected President as \\"an arrogant and racist bully\\". The committee session closed with convener Murdo Fraser asking Mr Trump if he had thought of putting in an offer to buy Rangers Football Club. \\"Can I tell you that I may be thinking about it\\" Mr Trump replied, to laughter. Despite a growing rift with its politicians, Mr Trump continued to take a keen interest in Scotland's politics. On the eve of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, he tweeted \\"good luck\\" to the people of Scotland, \\"whatever their decision may be\\". \\"The whole world is watching - really exciting!\\" The day after the No vote, he said it was \\"a great decision\\". And while he said he looked forward to a round of golf with the then-first minister, he opined that \\"if Alex Salmond had not pushed ugly wind turbines all over Scotland, the vote would have been much better for him!\\" And in January 2015, following the collapse in the price of oil, Mr Trump was back on Twitter to opine that \\"If Scotland would have gone independent predicated on 100 - 150 oil, they would now be bust!\\" He also touched down in Scotland during his Presidential campaign, in the hours after the Brexit referendum. Shortly before stepping on Trump Turnberry soil, the billionaire tweeted that the \\"place is going wild over the vote\\". \\"They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!\\" Mr Trump's tumultuous relationship with Scotland is perhaps summed up by that with its former first minister, Alex Salmond. There were happier times; the pair were pictured grinning together in New York, where they dined out as part of the GlobalScot business ambassador programme which the American was later ejected from by Mr Salmond's successor Nicola Sturgeon. Their long-running feud stemmed from the controversy over the Menie golf course and the wind farm lawsuits; Mr Trump spent several years trolling Mr Salmond about \\"disgusting and inappropriate\\" wind farms via the medium of Twitter. He also took to social media to criticise Mr Salmond for the decision to release Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi. He claimed Mr Salmond had sought his support for the move; \\"I said 'no way!'\\" At one point in 2013 Mr Trump said the then-first minister \\"may be the dumbest leader of the free world\\", before the following year retreating somewhat: \\"I have to admit Alex Salmond is a tough, smart guy\\". Things came to a head late in 2015, when Mr Salmond described Mr Trump as a \\"three-time loser\\" who was having a \\"damaging impact\\" on the Scottish economy by \\"condemning\\" Turnberry to \\"Open Championship oblivion\\". Mr Trump shot back that the former first minister was \\"a has-been and totally irrelevant\\", adding: \\"Does anyone care what this man thinks? \\"He should go back to doing what he does best - unveiling pompous portraits of himself that pander to his already overinflated ego.\\" Mr Salmond responded by attempting to call out \\"Chicken Donald\\" on his weekly radio chat show. Disappointingly, the President-elect never found the time to call in, but did issue a statement describing the SNP MP as \\"an embarrassment to Scotland\\". The Trump Presidential campaign featured repeatedly during the Scottish Parliament elections of 2016, with candidates quizzed on the topic by authorities ranging from BBC politics correspondent Glenn Campbell to funnyman Gary: Tank Commander. None of the Scottish politicians seemed particularly convinced that Mr Trump could triumph. Nicola Sturgeon - who stripped Mr Trump of his GlobalScot status over his comments about Muslims - said in March that if President Trump came calling, she would be \\"on the other line\\". Willie Rennie said he would say \\"get off my phone\\". Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: \\"I think if Donald Trump phoned me my question would be 'can I have fries with that', because I don't think he'll have a job because I don't think he'll be President of the United States. I have too much faith in the people of the United States to ever let that man near the White House.\\" Not to be outdone, Kezia Dugdale told Gary that Mr Trump was an \\"arse\\", later urging him to \\"stop preaching hate\\". Only UKIP Scotland leader David Coburn offered Mr Trump a ray of hope during the Holyrood leaders debate, by saying he would invite him for a round of golf. But then, he also described a Trump presidency as a \\"terrifying prospect\\" which \\"makes Dr Strangelove, the movie about nuclear war, seem more like fact than fiction\\". Mr Coburn has subsequently voiced confidence that Mr Trump will make \\"a great President\\", while Ms Sturgeon has congratulated him on his win.

Write a title: A career best 143 by wicket-keeper Brendon McCullum enabled touring New Zealand to take a convincing 225-run first innings lead against hosts Bangladesh on the third of the Pan Pacific Sonargaon first Test at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in city","completion":"Title: \\"Brendon McCullum's Outstanding 143 Propel New Zealand to a Dominant 225-run Lead in the First Test, Overpowering Hosts Bangladesh at Bangabandhu National Stadium\\" Body: On the third day of the Pan Pacific Sonargaon first Test held at the prestigious Bangabandhu National Stadium, New Zealand wicket-keeper Brendon McCullum showcased an extraordinary performance, scoring a phenomenal career-best 143. This outstanding innings played a critical role in enabling the touring New Zealand team to take a commanding 225-run first innings lead against the hosts, Bangladesh. The day began with New Zealand resuming their innings, and McCullum, being the standout batsman of the day, took charge of the crease with determination and focus. His natural attacking instinct soon surfaced, with several boundaries and aggressive shot selections leaving the Bangladesh bowlers in disarray. Brendon McCullum, known for his ferocious batting style, combined power and finesse to reach a well-deserved century, demoralizing the opposing team's spirits further. Throughout his dominating innings, McCullum maintained a brisk strike rate and frequently pierced the gaps with laser-like precision, leaving the Bangladesh fielders helpless at times. The right-handed batsman managed to achieve this magnificent feat by playing a wide array of shots, ranging from powerful drives to delicate late cuts and stunning reverse sweeps. Displaying exceptional skills, his innings was also marked by an incredible six, which soared over the boundary with sheer force. McCullum's 143 was well-supported by notable contributions from other New Zealand players, which strengthened the team's overall performance. The middle-order batsman, Kane Williamson, played a mature knock of 76, forging a critically important partnership with Brendon McCullum at a time when the team needed stability. Their brilliant collaboration deflated the home team's confidence while bolstering their own, giving New Zealand the edge they needed to take control of the match. Conversely, Bangladesh's bowlers struggled to make any significant breakthroughs. Despite their best efforts to contain the Kiwi batsmen, they only managed to pick up a few wickets. New Zealand's relentless scoring piled the pressure on the hosts, who found it increasingly difficult to stage a comeback. With this impressive 225-run lead, New Zealand is now in a comfortable position heading into the following days of the Test. The match's momentum seemingly rests with the visitors, as Brendon McCullum's herculean effort has lifted the team spirit, with their eyes set on a potential victory. In contrast, Bangladesh faces the daunting task of narrowing the gap and finding the determination to put up a strong fight against a fired-up New Zealand team. In conclusion, Brendon McCullum's career-best 143 has played an instrumental role in giving New Zealand a substantial lead. His thrilling innings has not only displayed his incredible prowess as a batsman but also set the stage for a potential victory in the Pan Pacific Sonargaon first Test at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. As the tension between the two teams mounts, cricket enthusiasts worldwide eagerly await the outcome of this intense battle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In December 1941, Japan launched, in quick succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States.

Coming off their last-second win over the 49ers, the Vikings stayed at home, donned their throwback uniforms, and prepared for the highly anticipated Week 4 NFC North Monday Night Football duel with the Green Bay Packers. This was a key divisional match-up, as the division lead was on the line, while quarterback Brett Favre was pitted against his former team. Favre entered the stadium to a series of boos coming from Green Bay fans throughout the stadium. Minnesota started off the first quarter with Favre completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. The Packers responded with quarterback Aaron Rodgers completing a 62-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jermichael Finley. In the second quarter, the Vikings struck again with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Favre to wide receiver Sidney Rice, but Green Bay answered with linebacker Clay Matthews stripping running back Adrian Peterson of the ball and returning it 42 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings closed out the half with a 1-yard touchdown run from Peterson. Minnesota began to build a lead in the third quarter as Favre hooked up with wide receiver Bernard Berrian on a 31-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings solidified their lead as defensive end Jared Allen sacked Rodgers in the Green Bay endzone for a safety. The Packers rallied with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to wide receiver Jordy Nelson (with a failed 2-point conversion), followed by kicker Mason Crosby nailing a 31-yard field goal. However, the Packers' push came too late and Minnesota was able to run out the clock for the win. With the victory, not only did the Vikings improve to 4-0, but Favre became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat all 32 NFL teams. Allen had a spectacular single-game performance with a career-best 4.5 sacks. Favre was awarded the NFC Offensive Player of the Week, marking the 14th time in his career he has earned this award.

The statement \\"People stand reading papers while waiting for a subway\\" provides us with some information but not enough to conclusively determine the content of the papers being read. While it could be inferred that people might be reading newspapers to catch up on current events or news, the statement does not explicitly confirm this. There are several plausible explanations for why people might be reading papers while waiting for a subway. For instance: 1. They could be reading newspapers covering a variety of topics such as news, sports, entertainment, finance, or even comics. In this case, they might be catching up on current events, but we cannot know for sure without additional context. 2. They might be reading academic articles, research papers, or professional reports for work or personal interests. These types of papers may not contain news about current events, and instead, focus on specific topics within their respective fields. 3. They could be reading personal documents like letters, contracts, or agreements they need to review or sign. Such papers may not have any relation to the news or current events. 4. They might be reading educational materials like textbooks, study guides, or curriculum plans that help them prepare for classes or examinations. 5. They could be reading creative writing pieces, such as short stories or poetry, for leisure or as part of a cultural enrichment program. Given these various possibilities, it is not logically sound to assume that people standing and reading papers while waiting for a subway are necessarily reading about the news.

Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

In 2012, C.K. won a Peabody Award and has received six Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as numerous awards for The Chris Rock Show, Louie, and his stand-up specials Live at the Beacon Theater (2011) and Oh My God (2013). He has won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album twice. C.K. was born Louis A. Szekely in Washington, D.C. on September 12, 1967, the son of software engineer Mary Louise (nee Davis) and economist Luis Szekely. His parents met at Harvard University, where his mother was completing her degree in a summer school program. They were married at St. Francis Church in Traverse City, Michigan. C.K. has three sisters. His paternal grandfather, Dr. Geza Szekely Schweiger, was a Hungarian Jewish surgeon whose family moved to Mexico, where he met C.K.'s Mexican paternal grandmother, Rosario Sanchez Morales. C.K.'s mother, an American with Irish ancestry, grew up on a farm in Michigan. She graduated from Owosso High School in Owosso, Michigan. She attended University of Michigan and graduated from Ohio State University Phi Beta Kappa. C.K.'s maternal grandparents were M. Louise Davis and Alfred C. Davis. When C.K. was a year old, his family moved to his father's home country of Mexico, where his father had earned a degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico prior to graduating from Harvard. C.K.'s first language was Spanish; it was not until after they moved back to the U.S. when he was seven that he began to learn English. He has said that he has since forgotten much of his Spanish. When C.K. left Mexico with his family, they moved back to the United States and settled in Boston. Upon moving from Mexico to suburban Boston, C.K. wanted to become a writer and comedian, citing Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, and George Carlin as some of his influences. When he was 10, his parents divorced. C.K. said that his father was around but he did not see him much and when he remarried, C.K.'s father converted to Orthodox Judaism, the faith of his new wife. C.K. and his three sisters were raised by their single mother in Newton, Massachusetts. The fact that his mother had only \\"bad\\" TV shows to view upon returning home from work inspired him to work on television. C.K.'s mother raised her children as Catholic and they attended after-school Catholic class until they completed communion. C.K. has said that his father's whole family still lives in Mexico. C.K.'s paternal uncle Dr. Francisco Szekely is an academic and an international consultant on environmental affairs who served as Mexico's Deputy Minister of Environment (2000-2003).

Please answer the following question: There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Marisol have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Chien? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. Answer:","completion":"Answer: Marisol has a lower chance of acid rain than Chien. Step 1: Identify the sources of electricity generation for both cities mentioned. Chien uses coal, and Marisol uses nuclear power plants. Step 2: Consider the hint provided - burning coal or other fossil fuels causes air pollution, which leads to acid rain and contributes to global warming. Nuclear energy does not release air pollution or cause other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. Step 3: Compare the sources of power for both cities. Chien's reliance on coal increases the likelihood of air pollution and acid rain in the city. In contrast, Marisol's nuclear power plants do not emit air pollution or cause acid rain. Step 4: Conclude that Marisol has a lower chance of acid rain than Chien, given the environmental impact of each city's electricity source."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Possible answers: did not want to give the store money, go home and order online instead from a neutral store, was happy with the store's politics Answer:","completion":"Sasha did this because she did not want to give the store money. Step 1: Identify the key elements in the sentence - Sasha, political candidate she hated, store's contribution, vote with her feet, shopping elsewhere. Step 2: Understand the context - The store contributed to a political candidate that Sasha didn't like and this bothered her. Step 3: Analyze the possible answers - We have three possible answers: not wanting to give the store money, going home to order online from a neutral store, and being happy with the store's politics. Justification for the answer: - The first option (not wanting to give the store money) seems plausible, as Sasha's decision to shop elsewhere is a direct response to the store's political contribution. She is effectively boycotting the store. - The second option (going home to order online from a neutral store) may be a possible consequence of Sasha's decision, but it is not the primary reason why she decided to vote with her feet. - The third option (being happy with the store's politics) directly contradicts the context of the sentence, which states that Sasha \\"hated\\" the political candidate that the store supported. Therefore, this option can be ruled out.

Monkeys , face to face DISCOVER magazine once reported on a curious event in the woods : a group of monkeys applied mud to their faces in order to keep away insects , but when they were done they seemed to have lost their ability to recognize each other ---two monkeys that were supposed to be friends even started fighting. \\"Faces are really important to how monkeys and apes can tell one another apart,\\" explained Michael Alfaro, a biologist at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), to the New York -based International Science Times . This is quite different from many other animals , which depend heavily on smells. Since faces play such a crucial part in the social lives of monkeys , could this explain why certain monkey species have such colorful faces while others have simpler, plainer ones ? To test this theory , a group of researchers from UCLA studied 139 monkey species , mainly from Asia and Africa, and analyzed hundreds of headshot photos of those monkeys from their databases. It was found that species that live in larger groups have faces with more complex color patterns than those that live in smaller groups. According to Live Science, researchers believe that this is nature's way of making it easier for monkeys to recognize each other since those living in larger groups have to distinguish between a greater number of faces. This is actually not that hard to understand . Just imagine if there were 10 people standing in front of you, all wearing white clothes. It would be much more difficult to tell them apart than if they wore clothes with colorful patterns. However, if there were only two people that you had to identify, a lack of color wouldn't be much of a problem. Apart from the need to recognize group members , researchers found that geography and environment also affect monkeys' facial colors. Species that live closer to the equator in thick, humid forests were found to have darker faces than those who live in dry areas further away from the equator. This is because darker faces help...

However, based on the given statement, we can make some educated guesses about the previous conversation. The reference to 'she' and her popularity even from childhood suggests that the prior discussion was about a particular woman. This woman is likely well-known or successful in her present situation since her popularity is brought up. This could mean that she's a celebrity, a public figure, a successful professional, or a prominent person within a certain community or group. Earlier discussions could have revolved around her achievements, her personality traits, her current popularity, or events she had recently been involved in. Perhaps there was a discussion about the reasons for her success or widespread acceptance, leading to someone mentioning that her popularity started during her childhood. Moreover, the tone of the statement (particularly the \\"It's really no surprise\\" part) adds an additional layer of speculation. This could imply that the previous conversation outlined some remarkable accomplishment or feat she achieved, leading to this person pointing out that her success was expected because she had always been popular.

Ahmadinejad's statement reflects the long-standing tensions between Iran and Israel and showcases the complexity of the political landscape in the Middle East. While Iran's president has maintained that his country wants \\"peace and friendship for all,\\" his comments and actions have generated concerns among Western powers and regional neighbors. The assertion that Israel should be \\"wiped off the map\\" has led to questions about Iran's true intentions and whether its nuclear program is meant for peaceful purposes or part of a plan to threaten Israel's existence. Despite Ahmadinejad's denial of pursuing nuclear weapons, Western countries and international organizations continue to express concern over Iran's nuclear ambitions. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations Security Council have imposed sanctions on Iran due to its lack of transparency and cooperation concerning its nuclear program. This further highlights the distrust that exists between Iran and the international community, particularly when it comes to the issue of nuclear technology. In addition, accusing the US of seeking a scapegoat for its failing campaign in Iraq is another example of Ahmadinejad's antagonistic approach towards Western countries. The blame game does not contribute to solving the conflicts in the region, and it only serves to increase tensions between the involved parties. Furthermore, this accusation puts more pressure on the already strained relationship between the US and Iran, as the US has accused Iran of providing support to militant groups in Iraq. Addressing the issue of Israel and finding a peaceful solution is essential for promoting stability in the Middle East. However, Ahmadinejad's rhetoric can be problematic. The idea of dealing with Israel without violence raises questions about what exactly this alternative approach entails. It is crucial for Iran to clarify its position and intentions concerning Israel and its place in the region. Open dialogue and diplomatic efforts among the involved parties can pave the way for peaceful coexistence and the resolution of longstanding conflicts. In conclusion, while Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has stated his country's desire for \\"peace and friendship for all,\\" his rhetoric and actions have led to increased tensions and suspicions. To achieve lasting peace and stability in the Middle East, it is crucial for Iran to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperate with the international community, particularly concerning its nuclear program and its relationship with Israel. Until these issues are addressed in a transparent and forthcoming manner, questions will persist about Iran's true intentions and its commitment to fostering peace in the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Master Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Beckett (Berenger), Force Reconnaissance Marine with an experienced sniper, and his spotter, Cpl. Papich (Aden Young), are on a mission to assassinate a Panamanian rebel leader in the jungle. Because they are extracted in daylight instead of at night, Papich is killed by a sniper. Beckett runs back under fire to carry Papich's body to the helicopter. Later, Beckett is paired up with an inexperienced civilian, Richard Miller (Zane), to eliminate a rebel general financed by a Colombian drug lord. Miller is a SWAT team sharpshooter, with no combat experience or confirmed kills to his name. While on the way to the staging area, Miller's helicopter is attacked by a guerrilla, and several members of the crew are killed. Miller is unable to take out the attacker; instead, the chopper's dying gunner makes the kill, but the co-pilot believes Miller made the crucial shot, earning Miller a false reputation. On the mission, Beckett insists on deviating from the plan that Miller was given. This, together with the fact that Miller has no experience or aptitude for jungle operations, sparks friction between the two. Early on, they encounter a group of Indians, who agree to lead them past the rebel guerrillas, in return for a favour: they must agree to eliminate El Cirujano (\\"The Surgeon\\"), an ex-CIA agent and expert in torture who has been aiding the rebels. Beckett agrees to do so. Uncertain of Miller's reliability and skeptical about his \\"kill\\" while aboard the helicopter, he tells Miller to kill El Cirujano in order to prove himself.

A major goal of DCA operations, in concert with OCA operations, is to provide an area from which forces can operate, secure from air and missile threats. The DCA mission comprises both active and passive defense measures. Active defense is \\"the employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a contested area or position to the enemy\\" (JP 1-02). It includes both ballistic missile defense and air breathing threat defense, and encompasses point defense, area defense, and high value airborne asset defense. Passive defense is \\"measures taken to reduce the probability of and to minimize the effects of damage caused by hostile action without the intention of taking the initiative\\" (JP 1-02).

SINGAPORE — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed Tuesday \\"to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\" during a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who then unexpectedly said he was suspending military drills with South Korea. Kim's commitment to denuclearize was included in a document signed after the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. It calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides promised to hold follow-up negotiations. While the document didn't lay out a specifics regarding denuclearization, Trump said at a news conference \\"We're starting that process very quickly. Very, very quickly, absolutely.\\" \\"We're going to denuke North Korea,\\" Trump also told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren, adding that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announcing one concession long-sought by North Korea not included in the document signed earlier in the day. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said, referring to the U.S. participation in joint military exercises with South Korea. At his news conference, Trump said the war games were expensive, provocative and inappropriate. ​Later, a Pentagon spokesman said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was \\"not surprised\\" by Trump's concession ending the war games and had been consulted, including discussions with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \\"We welcome the outcomes,\\" the defense spokesman said. \\"We support them.\\" Trump struck an optimistic tone about his talks with Kim. \\"My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct and productive.

However, it is important to note that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons are no longer a factor. Given the magnitude of this diplomatic event, it may be tempting to believe that real changes in North Korea's nuclear production are highly probable or guaranteed. However, analyzing the situation realistically and considering the lack of immediate concrete actions outlined in the document, it is more appropriate to choose option C (not enough information) or D (not very likely). Keep in mind that diplomatic negotiations, especially with a nation like North Korea, can be complex and slow-moving or subject to unexpected setbacks. Despite the good intentions expressed in the signed document and the positive rhetoric from both parties, the true outcome of this historic summit remains uncertain until definitive steps are taken by North Korea to denuclearize, and lasting agreements between both nations are secured."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"what order was amended and superseded by Executive order 11246?\\" is in \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\".

Executive Order 11246, issued by President Lyndon B.

Background: Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182; pronounced \\"blink one eighty two\\") is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Founded by guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; in response, the band appended the meaningless number \\"-182\\". Context: Eventually, the band appeared for the first time on stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the February 2009 Grammy Awards, announcing their reunion. The trio embarked on a reunion tour of North America from July to October 2009, with a European trek following from August to September 2010. The recording process for Neighborhoods, the band's sixth studio album, was stalled by its studio autonomy, tours, managers, and personal projects. DeLonge recorded at his studio in San Diego while Hoppus and Barker recorded in Los Angeles--an extension of their strained communication. The self-produced album--their first without producer Jerry Finn--was released in September 2011 and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. Its singles--\\"Up All Night\\" and \\"After Midnight\\"--only attracted modest chart success, and label Interscope was reportedly disappointed with album sales. \\"Despite growing evidence of remaining friction between the members,\\" the band continued to tour in the early 2010s. They headlined the 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour in North America from in 2011, and toured Europe in 2012. The band left Interscope Records that October, and subsequently released Dogs Eating Dogs, an EP, in December 2012. The trio toured Australia in 2013; Brooks Wackerman replaced Barker on drums as Barker was unwilling to fly after his plane crash. These dates were followed with a small North American tour, and a series of shows celebrating the tenth anniversary of the band's self-titled album that November. The band played a European tour in August 2014, culminating in them headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals; it was the band's fourth appearance at the festival and second headlining slot. The reunion of the band has been characterized as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era of the band in a later interview: \\"Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] I knew there was something wrong.\\" In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was \\"introverted\\" until \\"money started coming in,\\" after which \\"he'd get excited about Blink.\\" He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. \\"I'd do interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it,\\" Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on \\"non-musical activities\\" and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he \\"Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit.\\" After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: \\"Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable.\\" Question: How did they do on this album?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The album \\"Neighborhoods,\\" released in September 2011, was Blink-182's sixth studio album and their first after the reunion. It was a self-produced album and their first without producer Jerry Finn. The album peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. However, its singles, \\"Up All Night\\" and \\"After Midnight,\\" only experienced modest chart success. Consequently, Interscope, the band's label at the time, was reportedly disappointed with the album sales. The recording process for \\"Neighborhoods\\" was hindered by various factors, including the band members working in separate studios (DeLonge in San Diego and Hoppus and Barker in Los Angeles), which strained their communication. The band members also had to juggle personal projects and tours, which further stalled the album's production. The early 2010s saw the band continuing to tour despite evidence of friction between the members. In conclusion, although \\"Neighborhoods\\" experienced some success by peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, it failed to live up to the expectations of the band's label and was not as successful as their previous works. Additionally, the strained relationships between the band members and the unconventional recording process negatively affected the overall reception and quality of the album."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first sentence informs us about the variety of jewelry that can be found in the shops on Martinique. These include styles from mainland China, the Philippines, Africa, Haiti, and Japan. However, it doesn't disclose anything about how these items are brought to the island, or the origins and transportation methods used to get these products to the shops on Martinique. Consequently, the information provided in the second sentence, which is specific about the way Chinese and Japanese jewelry items are brought to the island (i.e., via container ships), is new information not mentioned or implied by the first sentence. Therefore, although the two sentences are related and concern the same general topic (i.e., jewelry on Martinique), one does not necessarily entail the other. The second sentence is adding information about the importation method - something that the first sentence does not address.

One of the hippies is pregnant and is not taking part in the ritual; she sees Sylvia and drags her into the clearing, where Horace freaks out over the fact that their ritual has been observed. A more recent member of the group, Andy, admits that he met Sylvia in town and invited her along, prompting Horace to violently hit him. Sylvia becomes frightened and runs away, but two other members of the group chase after her and catch her in the woods, where they brutalize her.The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the small town's bakery. With Mildred is Pete, Sylvia's younger brother who appears to be about 12 or 13. Together, they take Sylvia back home to where she lives with Pete and their grandfather, Banner. Mildred is sure her boyfriend will know who victimized Sylvia--with the town deserted, the only other people in the area are the construction crew working on a dam near the town. Mildred drives to the dam and informs her boyfriend, who works at the site.

Q: Q: Like the mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own dna and ribosomes, but chloroplasts have an entirely different function. chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out what? A: The answer is:","completion":"Chloroplasts are specialized plant cell organelles that carry out a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose, which can then be used by the organism to fuel its various metabolic processes and growth. Photosynthesis can be summarized by the following equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 In this equation, CO2 represents carbon dioxide, H2O represents water, C6H12O6 represents glucose, and O2 represents oxygen. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb light energy from the sun and use it to power the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Chloroplasts are unique in that they contain their own DNA and ribosomes, which are both necessary for protein synthesis within the organelle. This feature, along with their resemblance to certain types of photosynthetic bacteria, has led scientists to hypothesize that chloroplasts may have evolved from free-living cyanobacteria through a process called endosymbiosis, where the ancestral bacterium was engulfed by a eukaryotic cell, eventually becoming a permanent organelle within the cell. A typical chloroplast consists of a double membrane, with the outer membrane being relatively permeable and the inner membrane being less permeable and more selective in allowing molecules to pass through. Inside the chloroplast is a fluid-filled space called the stroma, which contains enzymes needed for various metabolic reactions, along with the organelle's DNA and ribosomes. Suspended within the stroma are structures called thylakoids, which are interconnected, flattened sacs where the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place. Thylakoids are often stacked into structures called grana. There are two main stages in photosynthesis: 1. Light-dependent reactions: These reactions occur within the thylakoids and are powered by absorbed light energy. During this stage, water molecules are split, generating oxygen gas and releasing electrons. The electrons are then passed through a series of specialized proteins called the electron transport chain, which results in the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), essential energy-rich molecules used in the subsequent light-independent reactions. 2. Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle): These reactions occur in the chloroplast's stroma and do not directly require light energy. Instead, they rely on the energy stored in ATP and NADPH molecules produced during the light-dependent reactions. The Calvin cycle utilizes these energy-rich molecules to convert carbon dioxide into glucose, which is then used by the plant for growth, reproduction, and other essential processes. In conclusion, chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis, the process of converting light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The organelles' unique DNA and ribosomes, along with their structural features such as the stroma and thylakoids, enable them to effectively perform these important metabolic functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dugard, her daughters reunite with Dugard's mother, stepfather says. Article:","completion":"Title: Police Investigate Potential Connections Between Phillip Garrido and Two Additional Kidnap Cases Introduction: In light of recent events, investigators are looking into two other kidnapping cases that may be connected to alleged kidnapper Phillip Garrido. Garrido, a convicted sex offender, is currently the prime suspect in the Jaycee Dugard case, in which Dugard was held captive for 18 years. Dugard and her two daughters, both fathered by Garrido, have recently been reunited with Dugard's mother and stepfather. Body: The Jaycee Dugard case has captivated the nation after she was found alive in the home of Phillip Garrido, 18 years after she went missing. Dugard, alongside her daughters, lived under the control of her captor in a series of squalid sheds and tents in the backyard of Garrido's home. This shocking case has led authorities to examine the possibility that Garrido could be responsible for other abductions as well. Police officials have recently announced that they are investigating potential links between Phillip Garrido and two unsolved kidnapping cases in the area. Although details about these cases remain limited to protect the integrity of the investigation, authorities have confirmed that they are focusing on cases that occurred within the same time frame and vicinity as the Dugard kidnapping. Detectives are meticulously examining physical evidence and witness statements from these two cases, in search of any similarities or connections to Garrido. Investigators are also exploring the possibility of conducting a thorough search of Garrido's property, in case it houses any clues or evidence related to the other abductions. If a connection is established between Garrido and these two additional cases, it will invariably strengthen the prosecution’s case against him and amplify the severity of his charges. In the meantime, Jaycee Dugard and her daughters have been reunited with her mother and stepfather. The family's spokesperson has praised the courage and resilience demonstrated by Dugard and her daughters after enduring such trauma. The family is now focused on healing and rebuilding their lives together. Conclusion: As the investigation into Phillip Garrido's potential involvement in two additional kidnapping cases continues, the nation remains in shock over the harrowing ordeal Jaycee Dugard and her daughters have faced. Their story serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant in the fight against abduction and exploitation. It is with hope that the unfolding investigation will provide answers to the families of the other missing individuals, and ultimately hold Garrido accountable for any heinous crimes he may have committed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a necrophobe afraid of?","completion":"A necrophobe is an individual who experiences an intense, irrational, and persistent fear of dead bodies, death, and anything related to death or the afterlife. This specific phobia is also known as \\"necrophobia,\\" \\"thanatophobia,\\" or \\"fear of dead things.\\" The term \\"necrophobe\\" comes from two Greek words: \\"nekros,\\" meaning \\"dead body,\\" and \\"phobos,\\" meaning \\"fear\\" or \\"dread.\\" It is important to note that while many people may feel uneasy or uncomfortable around death-related situations, a necrophobe's fear is often extreme and can significantly limit their daily life. There are several factors that may contribute to the development of necrophobia, which include: 1. Personal experiences: Traumatic events related to death or dead bodies, such as losing a loved one or witnessing a death, can trigger necrophobia. 2. Cultural or religious beliefs: Some cultures and religions place great emphasis on death and its potential consequences, which may instill fear in individuals. 3. Media exposure: Movies, TV shows, and books that portray death or dead bodies in a gruesome, frightening, or sensationalized manner can contribute to the phobia. 4. Family influences: If a close family member has a fear of death, their reactions and behaviors may influence the development of necrophobia in others. The symptoms of necrophobia can be both psychological and physical, and they may manifest as: 1. Anxiety or panic when confronted with death or dead bodies, or even thinking about them. 2. Avoidance of situations related to death, such as cemeteries, wakes, funerals, or discussions about end-of-life matters. 3. Persistent, intrusive thoughts about death or dead bodies. 4. Sleep disturbances, nightmares, or night sweats related to fears of death or dead bodies. 5. A rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, or choking sensation when exposed to death-related triggers. 6. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or feelings of unreality when confronted with death-related situations. 7. Gastrointestinal distress, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, during exposure to death-related triggers. Treatment for necrophobia typically involves a combination of therapy and self-help techniques. 1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): A licensed therapist can help people with necrophobia identify negative thought patterns and replace them with healthier, more realistic ones. This therapy may also include exposure to stimuli related to the fear to help individuals gradually face their phobia and reduce their anxiety levels. 2. Talk therapy: Sharing one's fears and experiences related to necrophobia with a supportive and understanding listener, such as a therapist or support group, can help alleviate some of the anxiety and emotional burden associated with the phobia. 3. Relaxation techniques: Practicing deep-breathing exercises, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization can help alleviate anxiety symptoms related to necrophobia. Implementing these relaxation techniques during exposure to death-related triggers can be particularly helpful. 4. Pharmacological intervention: In some cases, prescription medications, such as anti-anxiety medications or antidepressants, may be necessary to manage symptoms of necrophobia, particularly during the initial stages of treatment. 5. Self-help/support groups: Joining a support group with others who share similar fears can provide a sense of community, understanding, and encouragement for individuals struggling with necrophobia. It is essential for anyone experiencing necrophobia to seek professional help and support to learn how to manage their fear effectively. By working with a therapist and engaging in regular self-help practices, individuals can overcome their phobia and start participating in everyday activities without being held back by debilitating fear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

Article:","completion":"Title: Unlocking the Potential of Insurance: Engaging in Deeper Conversations with Your Clients Introduction The world of insurance can be a complex and dynamic landscape, with diverse needs and requirements to cater to. As an insurance professional, it is crucial to understand the unique situations, risks and preferences of each client to be able to provide tailored and effective solutions. Engaging in deeper, more meaningful conversations with your clients can offer valuable insights and strengthen your customer relationships. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this. 1. Asking the Right Questions One effective way to dig deeper is by asking questions that prompt reflective and thoughtful responses from your clients. Insurance-related concerns often stem from life events, milestones, and future planning. By encouraging your clients to consider these aspects, you provide them with an opportunity to make sense of their insurance needs. Some thought-provoking questions could be: - How do your current insurance policies cater to your short-term and long-term goals? - What life events do you anticipate in the next five years? Are your current policies prepared to support those events? - How would you like your financial protection to evolve as you enter different stages of your life? - Are your assets and liabilities properly insured to protect your family's and your financial well-being? By posing these types of questions, you can glean insights into your clients' ideas, expectations and priorities. This, in turn, allows you to identify gaps and mismatches in their existing insurance policies and offer more fitting solutions. 2. Learning Personal Details As an insurance professional, you can deliver better and more personalized services by understanding your clients' unique circumstances. This includes their family and financial situation, risk appetite, and personal preferences. During a consultation session, try to inquire about topics that offer a glimpse into your clients' lives. Asking about their family, hobbies, and career goals can help create a more comprehensive understanding of who they are and what matters to them. Remember, clients appreciate when you demonstrate genuine interest and empathy toward their needs and aspirations. By establishing rapport and trust, you encourage clients to share more pertinent information, which can be crucial for developing personalized insurance plans. 3. Scheduling Annual Meetings Maintaining ongoing communication with your customer base is essential for forging strong relationships in the insurance industry. A powerful way to achieve this is by scheduling annual meetings, which provide opportunities for both you and your clients to review and reassess their insurance needs. Regular, attentive conversations can significantly contribute to your clients' understanding of their financial trajectory and risk management. Additionally, annual check-ups offer an opportunity to explore newer and potentially better-suited insurance products on the market that meet your clients' evolving requirements. Conclusion As an insurance professional, your ultimate goal is to guide your clients towards better financial protection by addressing their individual needs and expectations. By asking the right questions, establishing personal connections, and maintaining regular communication, you can foster trust and loyalty in your client relationships. This, in turn, not only leads to more satisfied clients but also sets you apart as a knowledgeable and proactive insurance professional."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His mother, Sheela, works hard to maintain their modest lifestyle and dreams of her son achieving a better future through education and a well-paying job. However, the allure of love and social status, as evident through Arjun's attraction to Salma, an upper-class Muslim girl, demonstrate the tensions between traditional values and the new materialism gripping the society. Chabia, Arjun's best friend, is another individual trying to navigate the changing economy. As a mechanic working in a garage, he is exposed to the luxuries that wealth brings, especially through his interactions with rich car owners like Rohit. His love for Mona, a cabaret dancer, pushes him to desire to provide her a better life, even if through illegal means. Chabia's theft of money to make a new life with Mona, only to be abandoned by her, reflects the disillusionment and betrayal people can experience in the quest for financial success in this new economy. The escalating tensions between India and Pakistan exemplify the larger societal fractures and conflict present beyond the characters' personal lives. This backdrop heightens the sense of uncertainty and volatility, as these individuals try to pursue their dreams in a world increasingly defined by material possessions, power, and social mobility. In conclusion, those in the throes of the new global economy include young adults like Arjun and Chabia, as well as other individuals from different social and economic strata, who must confront the clash of traditional values and modern materialism while navigating their own aspirations and relationships. The movie \\"Hava Aney Dey\\" brings to light the complexities and challenges faced by individuals in contemporary societies as they grapple with shifting values and norms amidst rapid economic transformations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -15*y = 17*y - 71 - 153 for y.","completion":"OK, here is how you solve the equation -15*y = 17*y - 71 - 153 for y step by step: 1. We first simplify the equation as much as possible. On the right side of the equation, we can combine the constant terms -71 and -153 to get -224. This simplifies the equation to: -15*y = 17*y - 224 2. Now, we have y on both sides of the equation. We want to get y by itself on one side. We can start with adding 15*y to both sides to eliminate -15*y from the left side: -15*y + 15*y = 17*y + 15*y - 224 simplifying this leads to: 0 = 32*y - 224 Or flipping sides for clarity: 32*y - 224 = 0 3. Now, we can add 224 to both sides in order to isolate the term with y: Subtracting 224 from 0 on right transformation will lead us to: 32 * y = 224 4.

Here is a news article: A private Turkish plane with 11 people on board, all women, crashed in Iran on Sunday while taking the daughter of a top businessman and her friends back home to Turkey from a celebration in the UAE. Turkish and Iranian officials said there were eight passengers and three crew aboard the plane, which crashed in the south of Iran while flying from Sharjah to Istanbul. Media reports in Turkey said the eight passengers were Mina Basaran, the daughter of a leading Turkish businessman, and her seven friends, who had spent the past days in the UAE to celebrate her marriage. Iranian media said the plane went down in remote mountains in the snow-capped Zagros range during bad weather. The crew, including the two pilots, were also all female, the reports said. The reports, carried by the Hurriyet daily and several Turkish TV channels, said the Bombardier Challenger 604 private plane belonged to the Basaran Holding company of Mina's father Huseyin. The Istanbul-based Basaran is active in the energy, construction and tourism sectors. It also owns hotels. Reports said that just a day before, the eight young women had posted a picture of themselves smiling and relaxing in Dubai on social media. _________ Read more: Who was Mina Basaran, the Turkish bride whose private Sharjah-Istanbul plane crashed? No UAE nationals on board Sharjah-Turkey plane that crashed in Iran, killing 11 __________ Among those photographs was an image of the plane posted three days ago. In it, Ms Basaran posed on the tarmac carrying flowers, wearing a denim jacket reading “Mrs. Bride” and the hashtag “#bettertogether.” In another picture, she holds heart-shaped balloons inside the plane. The last videos posted to her account showed her enjoying a concert by the British pop star Rita Ora at a popular Dubai nightclub. There was no further activity on her account after that. Ms Basaran, 28, had also posted a picture on social media of her boarding the same Bombardier plane before it left Istanbul for the UAE, the reports added. She became engaged in October and the UAE trip was a traditional \\"farewell\\" to her friends before marriage. Ms Basaran had become a board member of her father’s company in 2013, Turkish reports said. The plane had left from the emirate of Sharjah and crashed near the city of Shahr-e Kord, about 400km south of Tehran, Iranian state television reported. Sharjah Civil Aviation Department said in a statement that the plane “did not apply for maintenance procedures while on the ground at the airport”. The plane took off at 5.16pm local time and disappeared from the radar screen at 3.30pm GMT, said the statement carried by state news agency WAM. It said the eight passengers on board were six Turks and two Spaniards. It did not give the nationality of the three crew members. Reza Jafarzadeh, head of the Iran Civil Aviation Organisation, confirmed the plane had eight passengers and three crew members on board. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Hurriyet said one of the pilots formerly flew Turkish army fighter jets as one of the country’s first female pilots. The other had worked in the past for flag carrier Turkish Airlines. Tasnim news agency quoted an ICAO official as saying: “The plane is on fire. After the pilot asked to lower altitude, it disappeared from the radar.” Mina Basaran was in the UAE with seven friends to celebrate her hen party. Instagram @minabasaran Iranian media reported that rescuers had been dispatched by land to the crash site, which is located in a relatively isolated area of Helen’s Mountain – a protected area in the Zagros range. Some reports said the plane went down during heavy rain. The head of Iran’s Red Crescent, Morteza Salimi, told state television that two helicopters would fly to the area on Monday morning “to search for the plane’s debris and bodies” – indicating there could be no survivors. The Zagros range was the scene of another aviation tragedy in February, when an ATR-72 twin engine passenger plane of Iran’s Aseman Airlines crashed there, killing all 66 people on board. The plane had disappeared from radar after taking off from Tehran on a domestic flight as a snowstorm battered the mountains. Rescue teams had to battle bad weather for days before they were able to recover the black boxes of that aircraft and had to interrupt their operation several times. They are still working on bringing the remains of those killed down the valley from the crash site, which lies at an altitude of about 4,000 metres. ||||| In this May 20, 2016 photo, a Bombardier CL604 aircraft, with tail number TC-TRB, descends to land in Istanbul.

(Associated Press) TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Investigators on Monday found the \\"black box\\" from a Turkish private jet that crashed in an Iranian mountain range on its way from the United Arab Emirates to Istanbul, killing all 11 people on board — likely including a Turkish bride-to-be and her bachelorette party. Authorities have so far recovered 10 bodies from the crash site in the Zagros Mountains outside of the city of Shahr-e Kord, some 370 kilometers (230 miles) south of Iran's capital, Tehran, according to a report by the state-run IRNA news agency. Heavy rains and wind in the mountain range since the crash Sunday made it impossible for helicopters to land in the area, though officials hoped to bring the bodies down from the mountain later in the day, IRNA said. Families of the victims arrived Monday in Shahr-e Kord, accompanied by Turkish diplomats, IRNA reported. The flight took off Sunday from Sharjah International Airport in the UAE, home to the low-cost carrier Air Arabia. A little over an hour into the flight, the aircraft rapidly gained altitude and then dropped drastically within minutes, according to FlightRadar24, a flight-tracking website. It remains unclear what caused the crash, though a witness told state television the Bombardier CL604 was on fire before it hit the mountain. Finding the aircraft's \\"black box\\" will help investigators trying to piece together what happened. That equipment, typically painted in a bright color to allow searchers to easily find it, records cockpit conversations and radio transmissions, as well as other data from a flight. Sharjah civil aviation authorities said in a statement late Sunday night that the plane's eight passengers were six Turks and two Spaniards. Three others were the flight crew. \\"The plane did not apply for maintenance procedures while on the ground of the airport,\\" their statement said. Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper and other media reports said the plane's three crew members — two pilots and one flight attendant — were all women as well. The flight likely carried Mina Basaran, the 28-year-old daughter of the chairman of Basaran Investment Holding, and her friends who had celebrated her bachelorette party in nearby Dubai. Turkey's Transport Ministry said the aircraft belonged to Basaran Investment Holding, which The Associated Press has not been able to reach since the crash. Basaran recently posted photographs on the photo-sharing app Instagram of what appeared to be her bachelorette party, which included eight women. Iranian authorities previously said the flight's passengers were all young women. Among those photographs was an image of the plane posted three days ago. In it, Basaran posed on the tarmac carrying flowers, wearing a denim jacket reading \\"Mrs. Bride\\" and the hashtag \\"#bettertogether.\\" In another picture, she holds heart-shaped balloons inside the plane. On Saturday, Basaran posted a picture with seven smiling friends from a Dubai resort. The last videos posted to her account showed her enjoying a concert by the British pop star Rita Ora at a popular Dubai nightclub. Sunday's crash came less than a month after an Iranian ATR-72, a twin-engine turboprop used for short regional flights, crashed in southern Iran, killing all 65 people onboard. ___ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, contributed to this report. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A private Turkish plane crashed in Iran on Sunday, killing all 11 people on board.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of the book. Firstly, the review's title suggests that the book was too specialized and complicated for an average reader. The contents of the book seemed to be more clinical and complex, rather than simplified and easily accessible for everyday people. The reviewer also mentioned their disappointment due to the lack of visual aids, such as pictures or drawings, further contributing to their difficulty in understanding the content of the book. This highlights the importance of illustrations in helping readers grasp complex ideas, especially in the context of this book, which according to the reviewer read half like a clinical psychology book.

According to the reviewer, there seems to be an excessive focus on the author's feelings and religious beliefs, which they may have felt were not relevant or distracting to the overall purpose of the book. The reviewer's final statement, that they would not buy the book again or recommend it to someone else, clearly shows their overall displeasure with the book. This statement can be viewed as a strong negative recommendation, further cementing the fact that the reviewer had a negative experience with the book and did not see its value. In conclusion, the reviewer's main issues with the book were its complexity, lack of illustrations, excessive focus on the author's personal feelings and religious beliefs, and overall lack of user-friendliness.

A:","completion":"To open a metal ring, follow these steps: 1. Identify the opening: First, you need to locate the point where the ring can be opened, usually a small gap or a hinge in the ring's structure. 2. Use appropriate tools: Opening a metal ring typically requires a pair of needle-nose pliers or a similar tool with a fine, pointed tip. Depending on the size of the ring, you might need two pairs of pliers (one for each side) to get a proper grip. 3. Secure the ring: Before attempting to open the ring, make sure it is steady and secure. You can hold it in your hand or place it on a stable surface, like a table. 4. Apply force carefully: Grip one end of the ring using the pliers, and hold the other end securely with your other hand or another set of pliers, if necessary. Gently apply force away from the ring to widen the gap or separate the hinge until it reaches the desired opening size. Be cautious not to apply too much force, as it may damage the metal or cause injury. 5. Adjust the opening: Once the ring is opened, you can adjust the size or angle of the gap if necessary to fit your needs. Remember to exercise caution during this process to avoid any damage to the ring or potential injury."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the following context: In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched USS Juniata to Greenland, to search for survivors from the Polaris expedition which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. Juniata's second-in-command was George W. De Long, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Naval Academy, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented Juniata from advancing beyond Upernavik; De Long volunteered to take the ship's tender, a small steamer named the Little Juniata, in the hope of finding survivors at Cape York, a further 400 nautical miles (740 km) north.The attempt failed; Little Juniata faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to Juniata in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler SS Ravenscraig—but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as \\"a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place\\", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: \\"The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest\\".The abortive Little Juniata mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach James Gordon Bennett Jr., owner and publisher of the New York Herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the Herald. In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would \\"receive due attention\\". answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions?
