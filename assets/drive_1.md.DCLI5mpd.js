Here’s the source text to use for information: Flat sheets form a protective layer between yourself and your comforter or duvet, preventing body oils or dirt from transferring to your top layer. But the need for flat sheets is a debated subject — nearly 6 in 10 Americans think flat sheets are essential, while others opt out of flat sheets altogether. Whether you’re team flat sheet or not, you can’t deny that finding the right material can make all the difference. Whether you prefer breathable percale sheets or irresistibly soft sateen sheets, using the right sheets can help you sleep like a baby. How to Use a Flat Sheet Lay the flat sheet across your bed in the same orientation as your bedding. Center the flat sheet on your bed, making sure there’s enough of the sheet to fold under on the sides and end of the bed. Check that the top edge of your top sheet is aligned with the top of your mattress. Fold the bottom of your top sheet underneath your bedding. Do hospital corners with the sides of your flat sheet (see instructions below). How to Do Hospital Corners Hospital corners are a type of flat sheet fold that makes your bedding look crisp and neat. Here’s how to fold them perfectly. Fold the end of the top sheet under the end of your mattress — the sides should still be hanging loose. Grab a piece of the top sheet one to two feet away from the end of the bed. Lift this piece up at a 45-degree angle from the corner of the mattress. Lay this piece on top of your mattress, it should make a triangular shape at the foot of your bed. Hold this piece in place, and tuck the excess sheet under your mattress. Try to make sure the excess sheet is tucked neatly, rather than crammed underneath for best results. Let the triangle-shaped section down and tuck any edges that hang below your bed underneath the mattress.","completion":"To use a flat sheet, all you need to do is lay the sheet across the bed in the same orientation as the rest of the bedding, center it, and make sure there’s enough sheet to fold under the sides and end of the bed.

Here are three hobby ideas for an introvert who enjoys spending time alone and wants to learn something challenging along with an explanation for why you might enjoy each recommendation: 1. Cooking. Learning to cook is a useful hobby for anyone, but it's especially well suited for an introvert as it's one that can be done entirely alone. It's also a great hobby for someone looking for a creative challenge as it can take months or even years to master fairly simple dishes and even then, there are an endless array of techniques and cuisines to learn. As someone who enjoys spending time alone and wants a challenge, cooking might just be the perfect hobby for you. 2. Chess. Although chess does involve another player, these days it is extremely easy to find opponents online, through apps, or you can even play against a computer, which makes this a suitable hobby for an introvert. One of the most challenging strategy games ever devised, chess is also perfect for someone who enjoys a mental test that will certainly help keep their mind active for hours on end. 3. Running. If you want to spend time outside, but still avoid talking to other people, consider taking up running as a hobby. Not only are there obvious health benefits to this activity, but many runners point to a \\"runner's high\\" where your body releases endorphins that make you feel good after a run. As someone who enjoys a challenge, you should also note that running can be a useful way to develop both your mental and physical stamina as you train yourself to run faster and longer over time. I hope that you find these ideas helpful as you search for a new hobby. Please let me know if you have further questions."},{"prompt":"From the text provided below, please list the seven Houses in the television show The Game of Thrones: Sometime later, the Iron Age humans from Essos called the Andals invaded Westeros, bringing along the Faith of the Seven.

Ronan is a Borderdoodle, which is a perfect hybrid breed that combines the best traits of Border Collies and Poodles. The Border Collie is known for its intelligence and herding skills, while the Poodle is known for its intelligence, hypoallergenic coat, and affectionate personality. When you combine these two breeds, the result is a dog that is not only trainable and brilliant but also loving and loyal to its humans. Ronan has been with me for about 2 months now, and I couldn't be more excited and grateful to be his momma. I am an avid dog lover that loves to train dogs to be the best versions of themselves. I've also always wanted to share my experiences and adventures with my best friend in the world. When I finally decided to adopt another dog, I spent much time researching breeds and looking for the perfect match for my family. I have had Border Collie mixes before but have struggled with some allergies related to their fur. That's when I discovered the Borderdoodle breed and fell in love with their intelligence, loving nature, and more hypoallergenic coat. But my Ronan is not just any Borderdoodle. He's a special dog with a unique personality all his own. From the moment I laid eyes on him, I knew he was the perfect companion for me. He is so smart, playful, extremely loving, and always eager to please. Whether we're exploring nature or cuddling on the couch, Ronan has become my perfect sidekick. In this blog, I will share our life, from the challenges of training a new puppy to the joys of exploring new places together. Eventually, I will share Ronan's training experiences as he becomes a service dog. I hope sharing our experience with other dog lovers out there inspires some to consider adopting or rescuing a Borderdoodle of their own. I also hope to provide a platform for other Borderdoodle owners to connect and share their own stories. So, join us on our adventures and get to know Ronan.

Most of them have roller skating experience through their physical education classes. What are some group games that we could play on the rink that will hold their attention and break up the long skating session?","completion":"Here are some group roller skating games that can be used for a group of intermediate-level skaters in the middle school age group: * The Four Corner Game: The Four Corner game doesn't require any skating experience and is mostly a matter of luck. When the music plays, the skaters travel around the rink like normal. When the music stops, they find a corner. A designated dice roller will roll the large fuzzy die, and whichever corner number is rolled is removed from the game. This process of elimination continues until only one player is left and they are declared the winner. There are variations that can be used, such as playing odd/even corners or keeping the number that is rolled rather than eliminating that corner, which speeds up the game significantly. * Rockin' Robin (or the Record Game): This game is for skaters of intermediate skill. The DJ will play the songs \\"Rockin' Robin\\" or \\"You Spin Me Round\\" and blow the whistle throughout the song. When the whistle blows, skaters must turn and skate in the opposite direction. The whistle strikes may be fast and challenging, resulting in skaters making a complete circle. Skaters must pay close attention to the whistles. * Shoot the Duck: This game is played in teams, either red vs. blue or girls vs. boys. When the DJ blows the whistle, students must assume a squatting position on their skates and cannot use their legs to gain speed. As skaters lose momentum, they will stop moving and sit on their bottom. The goal is to be the last skater moving in order to earn a point for their team. The first team to five points wins the opportunity to skate one song all by themselves. * Dodgeball: For advanced skaters, adults/teachers/employees can throw the balls while students skate around the rink and \\"dodge\\" the balls. If a skater is \\"hit,\\" they must sit in the middle of the floor. The goal is to be the last skater standing. If a skater catches the ball, the adult must sit down, instead. Adults should begin by throwing the balls high, so they can be easily ducked under, but aim progressively lower as the song continues. These games are competitive or involve silly movements that are sure to keep skaters engaged. Longer games such as dodgeball can be played during large skating blocks, while it's easier to fit Rockin' Robin and short rounds of The Four Corner Game in between other activities."},{"prompt":"Generate a short article on Spam and its history in feeding the US military. Refer to previous ration systems in use by the US military and discuss modern-day effects of spam as a military ration.","completion":"\\"In Defense of Spam\\" Spam has had a much-maligned place in pop culture. From pejorative names such as monkey meat or mystery meat to the many songs soldiers have written to denounce its salty, uniform, partially jellified consistency, Spam has rarely been described with particular fondness. This is particularly true in the United States, the country of its origin. But did you know that Spam played a vital role in the war effort? As a calorie and protein-dense foodstuff that could be shipped overseas in durable cans, Spam was an obvious asset to military planners. Spam tins fed allies in Britain, North Africa, and on the Eastern Front, where millions of cans were shipped to the Soviet Union under lend-lease. For starving populations, it was a dense can of life-saving meat, and the great industrial engine of the United States could produce them in heroic quantities. Perhaps too heroic, however. While Spam was certainly an improvement over the bully beef and salt pork that had fed previous generations of soldiers, the Army's reliance on it grew monotonous to many soldier's palates. Spam tins were happily traded off to civilians wherever soldiers were stationed, or even given away freely or discarded. A side effect of this is the creation of dishes such as Budae-jjigae, a Korean stew that had its origins around US Army bases. Korea, ravaged by war, was in short supply of food. In particular short supply was meat, and Spam filled the gap for many Koreans just as it had for the populations of Europe during WW2. Spam may not have been gourmet, but it was a standby that served its purpose faithfully for people in dire circumstances across the world."},{"prompt":"Finish the following prompt in 300 words or less, making it into an apocalyptic story. \\"He didn't want to go out on such a night but...\\"","completion":"He didn't want to go out on such a night, but with their food supply running low, he had no choice.

I'll be sitting with some of the other parents behind first base and your father should be here by the time the game starts. We love you!\\" said Mom as I grabbed my baseball bag out of the trunk of the car. \\"Thanks, Mom. Love you too,\\" I said as I slammed the trunk closed and turned toward the field. I tossed the bag over my right shoulder and jogged toward the dugout. As I got close, I pulled the bag down and leaned it up against the wall. I grabbed my glove and my bat out of the bag and brought them into the dugout with me. I was pretty early for the game still. Only the coach and a couple of my teammates were in the dugout. \\"Howdy, Paul,\\" said Coach, \\"I've got you playing second base again today. You can go ahead and get some stretching and long toss in with James.\\" \\"Sweet, sounds good, Coach.\\" I grabbed my glove and jogged quickly toward the outfield where James was already standing. I'll be honest. I was a little bit upset that Coach had me playing second base. I was hoping that he'd soon let me play shortstop again. Before I joined this team, I had only ever played shortstop. I was fast and had a really strong arm. On my old team, I was one of the best players. That was one reason we'd joined this new travel team. My parents wanted me to play with a more competitive team so I could get better experience and coaching. I missed a lot of my old teammates. A lot of them were friends that I still hung out with sometimes. But I had to admit that it was probably good for me to play with this new team.

I could buy a car. I could buy a mansion! As the delivery man left the house, I settled on what I would buy first. I walked out the door and drove straight to the local pet shop. The cashier greeted me with a hello as I walked in. I waved back at them while scanning for what I wanted. There were so many pets, from dogs & cats to snakes, bunnies, and guinea pigs. I was intrigued by all of them. But they were not what I was looking for. Then like a flash of lightning, the perfect pet appeared in front of me. It was like love at first sight. The shine of their green, rough shell. Their eyes looked like black dots glazed over. It was the perfect pet. A turtle. I motion to the staff that I wanted the turtle. They taught me all about turtles and what to look out for. The cashier checked me out and congratulated me on my new pet.

When she had opened their bedroom door, which she kept locked by a hook-and-eye on the outside, she had seen that the beds had been slept in but Eddie Jr, aged five, and his four-year-old sister Alice (nicknamed Missy) were gone. The casement window was PM cranked open about 75 degrees; Alice remembered having closed it the night before because there was a hole in the screen and she wanted to keep the bugs out. The screen was later found outside, leaning against the wall beneath the window, and nearby was a “porter’s stroller”—a converted baby-carriage with a box on it. Alice’s husband, an airplane mechanic who worked nights, protested that he knew nothing of the children’s whereabouts and, alarmed by the message, said he would come right over to see her. Alice and the children lived in a dispiriting redbrick apartment complex flatteringly named Regal Gardens, located near the campus of Queens College in the Kew Gardens Hills section of the New York City borough of Queens. Shortly after joining his wife, Eddie called the police, and the first contingent of patrolmen were on the scene in a matter of minutes. By 11 a.m. precinct cars were parked all around the grassy mall adjoining Alice’s apartment building at 150— 22 72nd Drive.","completion":"Eddie Crimmins was accused by his estranged wife of abducting their children from her home.

There was a takeout place back home called Wong's my folks and I patronized from time to time but they didn't have any seats or nothing. Still, I saw Chang wave me over the moment I walked in so at least I got the address right. I asked him about what he'd seen back at the warehouse on Thursday but he waved me off. Something about leaving business until after dinner. My curiosity was still burning in my mind about what he'd seen, but I figured I could eat. Soon a large plate of mixed vegetables and beef was placed before me. I'd have happily dug in right then and there, but they didn't give me a spoon or fork! Just two sticks to my side. I looked at Chang with confusion, and he just nodded and said \\"chopsticks\\", as if that was all I needed to know. I politely excused myself to the restroom. When I came back, I saw Chang with his own pair of sticks somehow perched between his fingers. I had no idea how but he was deftly eating with one hand and chatting with the waiter at the same time. In my pocket, I tried to mimic the same hand position as I made my way back to the seat. I didn't want Chang to think I was some sort of palooka. For the rest of the meal, I kept an eye on Chang, thankful he and the waiter seemed to know each other. That took the heat off my side of the conversation as I mangled the noodles in front of me, stopping and smiling anytime someone looked in my direction.

Give me at least a paragraph on three different style changes. Make sure one of the paragraphs is about innovations in undergarments.","completion":"At the Tudor court, small, flat-fronted waists leading to full breasts pressed down by the square-necked gown were all the rage. How was that achieved? In short, it was the use of busks that produced the silhouette and structure of the upper part of gowns. A busk could be made out of wood, bone, or sometimes metal. During the Tudor period, these flat inserts became more and more ornamental. They could be etched with personal messages or swirls of branching flora. These busks were the first step toward the corset we would later become so familiar with, providing rigidity and forcing good posture that advertised to the world that a woman was high-born. One very important piece of underwear was the \\"bum roll.\\" Showing up for the first time in the 1500s, this stuffed tube of fabric was tied around the lower portion of a lady's waist to increase her hip circumference and the amount of fabric she could wear on her skirts. Since silks and brocades were the going materials of the day and deeply exclusive because of cost, the more fabric worn translated into more wealth a wearer was likely to have. These bum rolls allowed for wide swathes of skirts, more pleats, and flounces. These undergarments also helped the women to bear some of the weight of their heavy skirts without it sitting directly on their hip bones. Tudor fashion was more about statement than comfort. Like busks, bum rolls were essentially shapewear, modifying the female silhouette to what was considered ideal at the time. One of the most important pieces of jewelry a woman of this period may have owned would have been her girdle belt. This was a long string, often of silver or gold and embellished with gems, that highlighted a woman's small waist and hung downward. Some women wore a pomander ball at the end of their girdle belts for when the city air got especially ripe. Others, like Anne Boleyn, used it to carry small prayer books about with them. Katherine of Aragon was even known to clutch the girdle belt of her patron saint while in childbirth, though this doesn't seem to have provided her with any luck. There are portraits of Kaherine herself in an immense string of pearls girdle belt that matches her royal necklaces. One of Jane Seymour, Henry's third wife, shows a girdle belt with a pattern of pearls and red gems that leads to a very large oval stone set in gold at the end."},{"prompt":"Write a recipe for tzatziki sauce from the perspective of someone who’s passionate about cooking and values specific, personal touches such as crushing fresh garlic into a paste instead of using garlic powder or minced garlic.","completion":"Tzatziki has a tangy, yet refreshing taste that’s as versatile as it is delicious, but homemade will always beat storebought.

Why should learning be collaborative? Collaborative learning is a method of active learning that relies on the principle of two or more students working together, towards a common goal. These activities vary widely, but most centre on the learner’s exploration or application of the curriculum, not simply on the teacher’s point of view. Collaborative learning arms pupils with the confidence to teach and learn from their peers and teachers, too. In primary schools especially, collaborative learning will help develop soft skills at an earlier age, helping children become more effective communicators. The differences between collaborative learning and cooperative learning can be interchangeable for educators, however, collaborative learning encourages students to make individual progress in tandem with others. Co-operative learning, meanwhile, promotes accountability with interdependence.

Keep it to around 250 words.","completion":"The world loves to drink coffee it is the second most consumed beverage in the world behind water and just in front of tea. In a year, the globe drinks around 400 billion cups of coffee every year. Many methods for brewing coffee have been developed around the world and each comes with its own benefits. Some of them include: - Pour over: A dripper is lined with a paper filter and filled with coffee grounds before hot water is poured over the grounds, then coffee drips down into the cup below. The paper filter helps trap the oils and grounds giving the final cup a clarified mouth feel. - Coffee Makers: Popular in much of the world, coffee makers are similar to a dripper but are automated with a water reservoir that heats the water before it hits the coffee grounds. Similar to the pour-over method it utilizes a paper or reusable filter that gives the coffee a clarified mouth feel. - French Press: An immersion method of brewing coffee in which the grounds are fully immersed in hot water before a metal filter is used to separate the grounds from the liquid. This method allows oils and small undissolved coffee particles into the cup giving a unique flavor. - Cold Brew: Another immersion method in which grounds sit in room temperature water for 8-12 hours before being poured through a filter. This method gives a crisp and refreshing cup of coffee with a silky mouthfeel that has a lower acid content."},{"prompt":"Take these instructions for a brownie recipe and put them into a list format, with each step on a separate line with the words \\"Step 1,\\" \\"Step 2,\\" etc. as the heading for each step.

Make it just a little bit too wordy, like it's a kid who just learned about philosophy and is trying to make everything super deep.","completion":"In order to understand the importance of kindness, you first have to understand what kindness *is*. It's not just saying nice words and smiling, though that is part of it. No, kindness is much deeper. It's looking at another person in need and feeling that need yourself, then doing whatever it takes to fill that need. It's empathy expressed as you help others with love in your heart for them. Every person, no matter who they are, deserves the kindness of others. To give them any less is to treat them like they're not human. Just showing kindness to others is an affirmation of our shared humanity. That's why it's important to show respect to others and to help where we can. This is how we develop compassion for the people around us. True kindness expects nothing in return for its actions. Instead, what you get from kindness is the joy of helping others, the warm feeling in your heart when you know you've made someone's day better. The most difficult acts of kindness often come when we're having a bad day ourselves. These are the times when kindness to others is most important because these are the times when it doesn't come naturally. Choosing to stop and consider what others might be going through before speaking or acting can save you from arguments, frustration, and anger, and it can be incredibly meaningful to the other person. A lot of people act like kindness is easy, but they're completely misunderstanding what it is. True kindness takes a lot of courage because it often involves doing the right thing even if it's hard or you don't want to. Selflessness is the kind of thing you have to work for; you don't just stumble into it. I believe that kindness has the power to change the world. Let's all be kind to one another. Every day, consciously do one act of kindness. Ask yourself, \\"Was I kind today?\\""},{"prompt":"Write a short advertisement for a fictional soda product coupon that is on sale for 20% off.

My guests were planning to come and do lots of hiking in nature, but the forecast now says it will be raining most of the time they’re here.","completion":"No problem! Here are some fun things to do in Santa Fe that don’t require good weather conditions. *Visit museums - There are lots of great museums to check out in Santa Fe. Take your guests to Meow Wolf to explore interactive, psychedelic exhibits crafted by local artists and funded by author George RR Martin, or bring them to see the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, the New Mexico History Museum, or the Museum of International Folk Art. *Grab a bite - Santa Fe has excellent restaurants, whether you’re looking for a tasty casual meal or a fine dining experience. CHOMP is an upscale food court hosting 4-5 popup restaurants, a bar, a dance floor, and a play area for kids. Plaza Cafe is a retro diner-style eatery serving breakfast all day as well as dinner, drinks, and desserts. Radish & Rye offers delicious upscale farm-to-table cuisine. Geronimo on Canyon Road is considered one of the best fine-dining restaurants in the country. Countless other restaurants in the area are sure to satisfy your guests’ cravings and curiosities. *10,000 Waves - While this famed spa is known for its beautiful scenery and outdoor hot tubs, the facility is designed to make hot tub bathing pleasant through rain, sleet, or snow. The spa also offers indoor massage and spa treatments, as well as fine dining and luxury lodging accommodations, so there’s plenty to do here, even if an outdoor soak is off the menu. *Violet Crown Cinema - The Railyard district in Santa Fe is often recommended for its outdoor concerts and easy walking, but there are a few indoor attractions worth visiting. Violet Crown Cinema is one of them. This movie theater has standard concessions, a full kitchen menu, and a bar serving wine and beer. You can dine in the lounge or take your food and drinks into the theaters. After the movie, you can walk less than 2 blocks to an indie bookstore, ice cream shop, pizza parlor, coffee shop, brewery, and boutique shopping *Sky Railway - Just around the corner from Violet Crown Cinema, you’ll find the Jean Cocteau, a small, historic indie theater revived by author George R.R. Martin. The novelist and patron of Santa Fe’s art scene also revived a dilapidated historical railroad line to create a luxe travel experience with Sky Railway. The train cars are outfitted in an antique style with food, drinks, and entertainment offered on board while the train travels right through the heart of Santa Fe’s Railyard district, as well as into more scenic surrounding areas. *Tumbleroot - If your guests enjoy music, they might like to catch a show at Tumbleroot Brewery and Distillery. This spot has excellent quality drinks, diverse musical acts, a large dance floor, a gallery and merch space, and a beautiful outdoor space in the back with food trucks, a bar, and a frog pond. *Shopping - Santa Fe is overflowing with artisans, so the shops on the plaza are always stocked with beautifully crafted and unique pieces. In this area, window shopping is just about as entertaining as a museum visit. Even if your guests don’t end up purchasing anything, they’ll be sure to enjoy browsing."},{"prompt":"How many miles are between Nashville, Tennessee, and Chicago, Illinois?","completion":"There are 473.1 miles between Nashville and Chicago."},{"prompt":"How many hours would it take to travel from Hawaii to Orlando, FL by plane on a nonstop flight?","completion":"It would take approximately 11 hours and 32 minutes to travel from Hawaii to Orlando by plane, nonstop."},{"prompt":"What is the price of a ticket to New York City?","completion":"I'm sorry, I do not have the knowledge to provide current airfare prices, I can only give you information on the distance from one location to another."},{"prompt":"Write a creative short story about the greatest golfer that ever lived, in rhyming form.","completion":"The greatest golfer that ever lived was none other than Barry Yamp.

Put in a numbered list. Copyright is a law that gives the owner of a work (for example, a book, movie, picture, song or website) the right to say how other people can use it. Copyright laws make it easier for authors to make money by selling their works. It is one part of a group of laws about intellectual property (the others being trademark and patent law). It helps protect authors from other people copying their works without permission and/or for commercial purposes. With copyright, a work can only be copied if the owner gives permission. If someone copies a work without permission, the owner can say they infringed their copyright. When this happens, the owner may sue for the amount that should have been paid. Most cases are handled by civil law. In more serious cases, a person who copies a work that is protected under copyright could be arrested, fined or even go to prison. Commonly, the copyright law will protect the authors and their heirs for 50 to 100 years since the author's death, or the first day of multiple authors' deaths. Many countries have modified their copyright law to meet international standards. However, there are still differences in national laws. In some countries, someone violating copyright law will be sued only to the civil law courts but other countries they can also be charged by criminal courts.","completion":"1.

Mack had always wanted to travel and see what was outside of his jungle home. So one day, Mack decided to sneak onboard a human caravan of wagons he saw taking off from the jungle into the desert. The caravan traveled west to Egypt. Mack managed to stay hidden the whole time under the blankets in one of the wagons, but when the caravan stopped in Egypt, Mack was discovered and the humans freaked out. Mack barely managed to escape the humans. Wandering into the desert on his own, he found and climbed the pyramids of Giza to get a good view of the desert to see where he should go next. Mack was spotted by tourists viewing the pyramids and they alerted the local authorities. Mack tried to escape, but this time he was captured by the authorities with a net. He was sold to an unloving circus owner, who put Mack on a ship that sailed for London. Arriving in London, Mack was placed into a circus with other exotic animals. He grew depressed because he was locked up in a cage all day and was only let out to perform tricks in front of hundreds of people. One day, a wealthy English lord who owned an estate outside of London came to the circus and was alarmed by the treatment of the animals in the circus. Using a portion of his wealth, he paid the circus owner for all of the animals in the circus, including Mack. He then moved the animals to his vast estate, where they were all allowed to roam freely on the grounds and were loved by the lord's family members. Mack became friends with a circus elephant named Timber and he got to live the rest of his life on the estate in England, loved by all who lived there.

If it's too hot for your hand, then it's too hot for their paws. 3. If you have to take your pet outside for a short period of time use pet-safe lotion on exposed parts of your pet's skin, especially the tips of their ears and nose. Keep pets in the shade wherever possible. 4. Make sure your pet has access to both shade and fresh drinking water. Put ice cubes in their water bowl or maybe make some frozen pet-friendly treats. Top up their water at a public tap when out and about and take plenty of fresh water out with you. 5. When its hot you might need to restrict the amount of activity they do or when they do it.

If you have pets like fish, birds, or lizards that are kept in tanks or cages, remember to keep them away from any direct sunlight and change the water regularly. Even if you don't have any pets you can still look after animals in the heat.

Make the story under 390 words.","completion":"In a large field full of dry grass, there were two rats. One rat, named Larry, was exceptionally clumsy. Larry fell out of bed every morning, but that did not stop him from doing what he had to do. Larry lived with his friend, Peter. Peter often had trouble paying attention to one thing for very long, but he was extremely fast. Peter could race around the field and bring food back into his hole in minutes. One day while Larry and Peter were out in the field looking for food, Peter got frustrated at Larry for being too slow, and occasionally dropping some food behind him as they moved through the field. Larry was offended and told Peter that he could easily make it across the field faster than him. Peter accepted his challenge and the two rats discussed a starting and endpoint for the race. Once ready, they lined up at the starting line and got Mr. Raven to say \\"3, 2, 1, GO!\\" Peter left Larry in a cloud of dust as he sprinted forward. Larry tripped and fell, but he got right back up and kept going. After a while, Peter looked behind him and didn't see Larry, so he kept going until he came across a pond. It was exceedingly hot outside and Peter knew he had time for a swim, so he got in and splashed around for a while. Meanwhile, Larry was still steadily racing toward the finish line. He had quietly passed Peter and kept moving forward. Larry looked behind him and saw Peter sprinting behind him. This startled him, and he lost his footing once again. Peter surpassed him and made sure that he couldn't see him anymore. Peter then came across his favorite snack, a fresh strawberry. He could not resist as he went off the path and indulged in the fruit. Larry had once again caught up to Peter, and the finish line was in sight. He tripped over a rock but bounced straight back up and continued. He finished the race and waited for Peter. Peter came into sight, walking with two strawberries in his hand. With a smile on his face, he handed one over to Larry and said, \\"You win.\\" They both sat down and ate strawberries for the remainder of the afternoon."},{"prompt":"I need to brainstorm a list of words writers can use to describe skin colors without comparing them to food or drinks.

Lower your car costs Refinancing your auto loan and taking advantage of lower interest rates could save you considerably over the life of your loan. Shopping around for car insurance regularly can also help you cut costs compared with simply letting your current policy auto-renew. You can cut ongoing car maintenance costs by driving less, removing heavy items from your trunk and avoiding unnecessary rapid acceleration. 11. Reduce your gas usage You can't control prices at the pump, but you can do several things to cut your gas use and save money. Try using a gas app to pinch pennies when you do fill up. 12. Bundle cable and internet You could lower your cable bill by as much as 40 per month by changing your cable package. And you could save more than 1,000 over two years by bundling your cable and internet service, depending on your carrier. Another option to consider is cutting cable or at least cutting some of your additional streaming services or premium subscriptions. 13. Switch your cell phone plan Changing your plan is one way to save money on your cell phone bill, but it’s not the only way.

How many students participated in the walkouts? 2. What was the reason for the walkouts? 3. What was the average class size? 4. What was the average student-to-counselor ratio? In the early days of March 1968, as many as 22,000 mostly Mexican American students walked out of their classrooms at seven Los Angeles schools, garnering national attention. The unprecedented event spotlighted educational inequality, galvanized the Chicano civil rights movement and inspired a new generation of activists, artists, educators and elected officials. The schools involved served the Mexican barrios of the city’s Eastside neighborhoods, or East Los Angeles, where Chicanos or Mexican Americans made up about 75 percent (130,000) of the student population. Students protested the vast educational inequality they faced: schools that were run down and understaffed, teachers that were overworked and undertrained. Class size averaged around 40 and the student-to-counselor ratio was 4,000-to-1, according to the United Way of Los Angeles. Students also complained they were being steered toward vocational and domestic training, instead of academic courses that would help them get into college. Early 1968 was a time of deep civil unrest in the U.S., rife with antiwar and civil rights protests. Aware of these and other parallel social movements taking place in the country and around the world, Chicanos demanded that their language, history and culture be reflected in their schools’ curriculum. Historians point to the East L.A. walkouts as the first time the Chicano movement moved from the rural setting of the United Farm Workers’ strikes of 1965 to an urban setting. The Blowouts, as they are also known, also marked the movement’s first major youth-led protest. “This time, it was the youth who said, unh-uh,” says Valerie Talavera-Bustillos, professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Los Angeles. “That really made people stop and think, ‘Oh yeah, these kids are right. We don’t have to accept [the school conditions].’ It was a turning point.”","completion":"1. Almost 22,000 mostly Mexican American students participated in the walkout. 2.

Here’s a list of classic love songs for your rehearsal dinner with their release years for easy reference: 1. “The Way You Look Tonight” by Frank Sinatra (1964) - This classic song has been performed by several artists, but Frank Sinatra’s version is widely considered the most popular. 2. “L-O-V-E” by Nat King Cole (1965) - Nat King Cole’s smooth and mellow voice is great for background music, and while this song may inspire some guests to hit the dancefloor, its tempo should keep the dancing fairly tame. 3. “Crazy Love” by Van Morrison (1970) - This song has been covered by several artists and appeared on the soundtrack to a number of popular films. 4. “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” by Stevie Wonder (1972) - With its romantic lyrics and upbeat sound, this classic song will be sure to put your guests in a great mood. 5. “Going to the Chapel” by the Dixie Cups (1964) - It’s hard to imagine a song with lyrics better suited to this occasion. 6. “I Say a Little Prayer” by Dionne Warwick (1967) - While this romantic classic may not be a big hit on the dancefloor after being featured in a rehearsal dinner scene in the film ‘My Best Friend’s Wedding,’ it might inspire your guests to burst into song at the dinner table. 7. “At Last” by Etta James (1960) - This classic is a popular pick for a couple’s first dance at their wedding reception, with timeless lyrics and a moving, emotional performance by Etta James. 8. “Be My Baby” by the Ronettes (1963) - The lyrics of this song hold promises for a wonderful relationship. It has appeared on many “Best of the 1960s” lists and is considered by some to be among the greatest songs of all time. 9. “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” by Frankie Valli (1967) - This song was so popular, it earned Frankie Valli a Gold Record. It’s been covered by artists all over the world and appeared in lots of popular movie and television soundtracks. 10. “Love is Here to Stay” by Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong (1957) - This hit, composed by George Gershwin, has been covered by countless artists, but nothing says romance like a duet performed by jazz icons Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong."},{"prompt":"Create a blog post about the importance of seeking treatment for a suspected dental abscess. Assume that the person asking isn't sure what's causing their toothache and they're wondering just how serious it might be, or if it's a true emergency/","completion":"Gradually worsening toothache pain can be more than discomforting. As this continues to progress you might also notice a building pain and pressure deep within your gums. This is a distinct sign that you need to seek timely treatment from a dentist or some other type of oral care specialist. Untreated tooth decay can do more than hamper the basic function of your mouth and cause problems with sensitivity. In time the bacterial presence can invade the core structures of a tooth causing an infection in the root and surrounding gum tissues. Symptoms of a dental abscess that needs emergency treatment include: - An intense or throbbing toothache - Pain in your gums - Redness inside the mouth around the tooth - Redness outside the mouth on the face or jaw - Sensitivity to hot or cold food and drinks - A foul taste in your mouth. - Trouble opening your mouth - Being unable to chew food in that part of your mouth - Swelling in your face or on your jaw - A fever If the problem is caught early a dentist might be able to treat the tooth by performing a root canal to extract the infected part of the root and drain any fluid. This treatment will likely include a follow-up course of prescription antibiotics to clear up any residual infection. If the dental abscess is severe, the dentist might need to drain the bacterial fluid and completely extract the tooth to prevent bacteria from passing from the abscess to your bloodstream. Sometimes a dental implant can be placed after the extraction. Though most oral care experts prefer to wait until the infection and inflammation have gone down. If the tooth cannot be viably treated and a treatment-based extraction the dentist will likely provide you with a prescription for pain medication along with antibiotics. Once everything is fully healed and all infection concerns have passed, you can explore your dental restoration options. Many people who lose a tooth to a dental abscess will choose a dental implant over a partial or single-tooth denture."},{"prompt":"Write a song that expresses the depth of a father's love for his daughter.

In 1904, the London Daily Mirror newspaper challenged Houdini to escape from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinée performance at London's Hippodrome theatre. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event.[44] The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his \\"ghost house\\" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. At one point he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a penknife and, holding it in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56 minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the six-inch key.[45] Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. At the time, Houdini said it had been one of the most difficult escapes of his career.[46] After Houdini's death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, admitting that Houdini was tested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was six inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.[47] James Randi believes that the only way the handcuffs could have been opened was by using their key, and speculates that it would have been viewed \\"distasteful\\" to both the Mirror and to Houdini if Houdini had failed the escape.[20]: 165 This escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's Mysteries at the Museum in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum.[48] A full-sized construction of the same Mirror Handcuffs, as well as a replica of the Bramah style key for them, are on display to the public at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania.[49][50] This set of cuffs is believed to be one of only six in the world, some of which are not on display.[51]","completion":"A newspaper challenged a magician to escape from special handcuffs.

Various muscles perform unique functions, which can be classified as: • Skeletal muscle - Specialized tissue that is attached to the bones, and allows movement which is controlled through voluntary conscious control. These muscles are typically grouped into opposing pairs, such as biceps and triceps, and together form the musculoskeletal system with the bones. • Smooth muscle - Muscles that are not under human conscious control, these are located in various internal structures such as the digestive tract, blood vessels, and arteries. These muscles are arranged in layered sheets along the length of the structure, which contract in wave-like motions. • Cardiac muscle - specifically the heart, which is a muscle that contracts and relaxes without human control to pump blood throughout the body."},{"prompt":"Where was Anheuser Busch started?","completion":"Anheuser Busch was started in a small brewery in St. Louis, Missouri in 1852 by George Schneider.

Amidst the bustle, a scent so sweet, The sample stops, a tempting treat. One, then another, a whole bunch, These samples make a tapas lunch. Bulk-sized goods fill up our hands, Our cart (and bill) quickly expands. A two pound 2 pack of some chips A 60-pack of chicken strips. Endless choices at every turn, And cash back savings we can earn.

Can we start our discussion with a short paragraph of 5 sentences?","completion":"The two main types of machine learning are supervised and unsupervised models. Supervised models have a target variable they are attempting to build a model around. For example, there are binary classification models that attempt to denote a specific variable either true or not. In unsupervised learning methods, there is no distinction between what variable is the most important. Clustering is a good example, where different instances are grouped but not necessarily for the same reasons."},{"prompt":"Rewrite Macbeth Act 1, Scene 7 into modern English.","completion":"Macbeth: If I'm going to kill the king, it's better that I do it quickly and all the better for it. If the killing of the man would kill any chance of retaliation and guilt, the better. That strike could be the be-all and end-all, but if it's not, we risk our souls. If I'm wrong, there will be consequences here and now, and not just spiritual consequences. We, who teach messy and bloody lessons, risk being taught messy and bloody lessons in our own turn, eh? That's the natural consequence, and it returns a poisoned cup back to our own mouths. After all, the king is here and trusts me twice as much--he's my king and my cousin, and he's my guest, so I should protect him from murderers, not do the murdering myself! Although he's been such a top-notch king that if he was to die, then his good deeds would pretty much guarantee his way into heaven. So there's that. Lady Macbeth: Oh, hey, why are you acting weird and stuff? Macbeth: Look, honestly, this has gone way too far. We're leaving it right there. The king has given me a bunch of stuff lately, and everyone thinks I'm a pretty good guy. Why would I mess that all up just when things are going so well? Lady Macbeth: Oh, you must have been drinking, then, when you were like, 'Oh, I'm gonna' kill the king'. It's like your resolve went to sleep and woke up pale and sickly now. I guess that's how you treat your oaths, so that must be how you love, too. Are you scared to rise and grind? Are you afraid to take what you deserve? I guess you'd rather live as a coward than do what you said you would. Macbeth: Ugh, please. I do everything that any man dares, and a greedy man is not a man at all, man. Lady Macbeth: You used to be cool, Macbeth. Now you're just lame. So lame. Just do it, don't be a scaredy cat. Macbeth: And what happens when Duncan catches us and peels our skin off?

Just as he did back then, the old man sat in the back pew of the church. The man was dressed entirely in black, suitable attire for Mary's funeral, and held a large black suitcase in his hands. As the pastor droned on in his Sermon about the shortness of life and the forgiveness of God, the old man barely seemed to move. Jake turned back around to face the front, dismissing the old man, his eyes lingering on the framed photo of his sister next to her closed casket. It was dreadful enough to have to bury your sister when she was only 35 but for her to have died in such a manner - shivers crept up his spine and he gave a slight shrug to hide it. The detective sitting next to him gave him a sideways look. Matthew had been the one to suggest that his sister's killer may make a reappearance at the public funeral and volunteered to sit beside Jake during the ceremony. Cameras had been placed strategically around the church in an attempt to capture the image of everyone in attendance. Later, Jake would wonder if he had imagined the old man -- if he had been a coping mechanism of sorts that began with his mother's similarly traumatizing murder those five years ago because as Matthew reviewed the camera footage from the funeral, there was no capture of that man at all."},{"prompt":"Write me a paragraph for an article about Yadier Molina. The paragraph should be between 150-250 words.","completion":"Yadier Molina is one of Major League Baseball's all-time greatest catchers. The 9-time gold glove winner is considered by many to be the greatest defensive catcher in the history of baseball. Prior to free agency, Molina stated that if the right offer didn't come along he would consider retiring from baseball as a whole. Molina's retirement would be a significant one for the St. Louis Cardinals as well as baseball as a whole. Molina has played all 17 years of his career with the Cardinals. Playing that long with one team is a rarity nowadays, especially at a position as physically demanding as a catcher. Drafted in 2000, the now 38-year-old Molina has amassed 160 homers across over 2,000 regular season games. Batting at a very effective .280 clip, Yadier Molina has been selected to 9 all-star games in his career and won two World Series trophies. Although he's slowed down at the plate, Molina is still one of the top defensive catchers in the entire league.

Write in a Shakespearian tone. Capitalize each word \\"She's so lucky, she's a star.\\" — Britney Spears...and Gen Z all over TikTok. If your FYP hasn't picked it up yet, we're talking about the latest trend Lucky Girl Syndrome — a new way to manifest good fortune in your life. But does it actually work for everyone? What is Lucky Girl Syndrome? Lucky Girl Syndrome is the idea that as long as you believe that things in life will go your way, they will. Think: You believe you'll come into money, and you do. You believe that cars will get out of your way so you can merge onto the freeway, and they move. You believe you'll be invited to New York Fashion Week, and you are. If you took psych 101, you might recognize this as the law of assumption: That everything you believe to be true will, in reality, become true. Or maybe you've heard it called manifesting. Or \\"The Secret.\\" In any case, it's the idea that so long as you believe that you attract luck, the odds will be ever in your favor. Here's one example, which went viral on TIkTok: Two friends wanted certain rooms in their apartment — but they didn't want to ask their other roommates for the rooms. And they knew that things don't always work out in their favor. So they decided to start manifesting the concept that \\"everything works out for us.\\" Turns out, the other roommates offered the two friends the rooms they wanted. Moral of the story: Think positive. But not everyone can just make their own luck...can they? Well, it might not be all about luck. A quick review of your FYP might confirm that all the ‘lucky girls’ fit perfectly into society’s beauty standards. Most of the TikTokers gushing over Lucky Girl Syndrome are white, thin, and conventionally attractive. Coincidence? Probably not. Sometimes systemic biases can create or block opportunities for some people. Something to be mindful of when you’re thinking of testing this trend out. theSkimm Looking on the bright side and believing that things will work out for you can have a positive impact on your mental health.

Keep it under five paragraphs.","completion":"Just two weeks ago, Peter, a baby bird, made his grand entrance into the world. After being nurtured by his mother and father, it was almost time for Peter to venture out of the nest. The world outside the nest was unchartered territory, and Peter was anxious about making the jump. Peter's parents started nudging him and his siblings toward the edge of the nest, so they can get a better view of the world. It was a beautiful place, but there were so many noises and things moving around. To say it was daunting would be an understatement. But, Peter was intrigued. One by one, Peter's siblings made the venture outside the nest. They would come back to visit a few times a day. They told him that the world was a great place and that they were having so much fun exploring. Peter decided it was time to be brave and join his parents and siblings outside the nest. He slowly stepped to the very edge. However, upon looking down he realized just how high up he was. He cautiously moved back into the center of the nest. His mother and father saw this and decided to head to the nest. They assured him that they would be there to help. Peter agreed to give it a go. Back on the edge, he began flapping his wings. He took a deep breath and made the daring jump. Much to his surprise, he was flying with ease. Peter saw his parents and siblings foraging around in some grass just below the tree he was in. He swooped down with ease to join them. He was delighted to see that they were in an area with abundant flying insects. With one quick jump, he caught an insect. He was so proud to be able to catch his own meals. He realized that while he had to be cautious in a world that can be quite dangerous, it was a fantastic place to explore and live."},{"prompt":"I’m writing a story where a teenage werewolf navigates high school.

Is there any validity to these thoughts? Please address the top concerns of having and using microwaves and explain why those claims are or are not true.","completion":"Microwaves are very powerful pieces of equipment, capable of heating food to over 200 degrees Fahrenheit and emitting 2000 watts of electricity. They do have a controversy on whether they are entirely safe to be using or not. Do they cause cancer? Do they make food less nutrient-rich? Are they safe for heating water? Microwaves do use radio waves to heat food and emit radiation. However, the type of radiation is non-ionizing and does not have the power to change your DNA, and is not as dangerous as an X-ray. There have been no sustained cases of microwaves causing cancer. Further, the FDA monitors the amount of radiation that manufacturers are allowed to have leaked from microwaves and it is minuscule. If your microwave is in disrepair the amount could be higher so it's best to replace them. It is also advised that people do not stand directly in front of microwaves while in use. Making a cup of boiling water in the microwave might be more of a hazard than you think. If you are looking for a quick way to boil water it might be best to think again before popping it in the microwave. By doing so, the water can be superheated and when disturbed can erupt. The water may seem innocuous enough, but add in some instant coffee, stir it, or drop in a teabag and the water can suddenly, violently boil over. This has led to severe burns. Superheating occurs when liquids are quickly heated much past their boiling point. This makes it so that the liquid does not have time to release the steam. Watch out for this as it can cause injury. It has been thought that microwaving foods cause them to lose their nutritional value. This has been thought because people who regularly use the microwave are generally less healthy than those that do so less often. Correlation does not equal causation in this case though. It seems that in general the health of those using the microwave is less because they are picking foods that are marketed for the microwave. These foods often have less nutritional value. When cooked in the microwave versus the stove food was found to have retained more nutritional value because it was cooked for a shorter period. Overall, take general precautions, use common sense and the microwave should be pretty safe."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this love letter as a breakup letter.

While many dogs end up loving spending time in their crates as they feel it is their safe space, if you don’t do it right, they could end up hating it! So, to crate train your dog, here’s what you need to do: - When you bring the crate home, put it in a room where your dog feels comfortable, like your bedroom or living room. - Take one of their favorite blankets or pillows and put it inside. - Leave the door open for at least one day but don’t encourage the dog to get in. - Show your dog the crate and let it sniff around the outside. - Put your dog's favorite treat or a small bowl of food inside. - Let the dog get in to get the treat and then get out without shutting the door. - Keep this practice for a few days; continually allow your dog to get in to get the treat and then get out when they want to. - After 3 or 4 times, place the treat in the crate, and then when the dog gets in, shut the door. - Sit next to the crate, telling the dog they’re a “good dog.” - After a few minutes, let them out again. - Keep up this practice, prolonging how long the dog stays inside the crate until they seem comfortable. The main objective is to make sure your dog doesn’t think the crate is a punishment but a place to relax. It's important that they know no matter how long they’re in there, you will always let them out."},{"prompt":"I'm trying to come up with some creative podcast names.

He feels something deep inside him, an emotion that he's been warned against.

He's aware that he's different, but he thinks he can keep it under wraps. Scene 2: The protagonist is at work typing away at his automated computer. He can hear the buzz of the machines around him, and the hum of the pills working their magic in his system. But then he sees something; a colleague who's crying at their desk. No one else seems to notice or care, but he can feel the pull of that emotion he's been suppressing. He knows he shouldn't, but he does it anyway. He walks over and puts a hand on their shoulder, feeling the sadness that's radiating off them. It's both beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Scene 3: The protagonist is at a party among people who are laughing and dancing to automated beats. He's feeling alone and isolated until he sees someone who's not taking their pill. They're smiling and chatting animatedly with their emotions unbridled. He's drawn to them and wants to know them better. They take him aside and tell him that they know the truth that there's a conspiracy afoot. The machines and pills are suppressing humanity's emotions for a reason, and it's up to them to stop it.

The expense reports had to be done and Catherine was out of the office for a week on vacation. She reached for her coffee and brought the cup to her lips before she remembered that it had gone cold hours ago. She put the cup down and refreshed her screen. The numbers were starting to blur. After typing in one last figure and hitting 'enter' she was finished. Denise rubbed her eyes, stretched, and powered down her computer. One look out the window told her that the wind outside had picked up since lunchtime. So, she put on her coat before grabbing her purse and heading for the door. She pushed the metal handle inward, but instead of swinging wide like it usually did, the door didn't budge. Denise was so used to having it fly open that she almost ran right into it when it didn't budge. She tried pushing it in again. The bolt didn't slide away from the frame. Remembering that it was after hours, she decided to try another door, hoping she hadn't been locked in. That door was locked too. And then, the lights went out.

I’ve recently been taking more photos with my camera, and I want to bring it to a large concert venue to take pictures of bands performing. How can I make that happen and are there any issues I might run into?","completion":"Music venues often require some form of credentials to be allowed inside the doors with a professional detachable lens camera. Contacting the venue or bands playing through email and social media channels can help you receive what is called a media pass, a badge, wristband, or sticker letting the local staff know you are supposed to be there taking photos. When sending emails to venue staff or artists, it will be helpful to provide a portfolio of relevant content you have created. However, this can prove difficult if you cannot get into a music venue to create that content. To work around this, you can start photographing at smaller venues hosting live music including coffee shops or bars that might have less strict photo policies. From there, you can build samples of your work to show the larger professional venues and increase the likelihood of being allowed inside. It is also worth noting that sometimes larger music venues have photo policies only to restrict the use of detachable lens cameras. In this case, you can still take photos with your mobile phone to begin creating your portfolio and enter the world of live music photography."},{"prompt":"Please use 2 sentences to summarize the information about watercolor paint. Watercolor Painting Watercolor painting is also popular and can be done by beginners, however, it does require a little more skill to do it properly. The paint is usually transparent and contains a pigment and a binder. These paints are water-based, so they are safe to use, and you can clean up by simply using water. Watercolor paper is what you would use to paint on. Watercolors are considered a little unforgiving if you have made a mistake as it dries fairly quickly, but there are a few methods you can use to fix mistakes. For example, you can reactivate the paint using a wet brush. You can use various watercolor techniques to create various painting styles, from landscapes to portraits and more.","completion":"Watercolor painting is a popular painting method that allows for a variety of painting styles using water-based and transparent paint with a pigment and a binder.

Whether you've got the winter blues, or maybe work is getting you down, here are 7 little things you can do to make yourself feel better: 1. Talk to a friend. Telling someone what's been getting you down can be very cathartic. Maybe they will lend you an empathetic ear or offer you advice. Either way, it's helpful to know you have people who are on your side, and you're not alone. 2. Listen to music. I once heard a phrase that resonated with me: \\"When words fail, music speaks.\\" No matter what you're feeling, I can guarantee there's a song that explains the way you feel. Put on your sad song playlist and have a good cry (this seems counter-productive, but I promise you'll feel better afterward), listen to something high-energy and upbeat, or just indulge in your all-time favorites. 3. Treat yourself. Rewarding yourself is a great way to make yourself feel better. Maybe you've been eyeing up a new outfit - don't think twice. You deserve it! 4. Eat something you love. If you're feeling down, food can be a real mood booster. Sometimes a slice of cake or a juicy cheeseburger is just what we need to perk ourselves up a little. 5. Cook or bake. Even if you're not so good at it, cooking or baking something is a fun way to cheer yourself up. Learning a new recipe, or having a loved one over to bake some delicious sweet treats, is a great distraction from stress and sadness. 6. Play a video game. No matter what kind of games you like to play, playing a video game is a great way to cheer yourself up. Maybe you're taking your stress out on some zombies in a shooter or exploring some breathtaking scenery in an open-world adventure. Either way, video games are a great distraction and a mood booster. 7. Spend time with furry friends. Nothing cheers me up more than hanging out with my pup. If you don't have your own 4-legged friend, go visit a family member or friend who does, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about."},{"prompt":"Based on the given list of ingredients, would the recipe be part of the main course or dessert? 4large egg yolks ½cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided ¾cup heavy cream 1cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces) For the Assembly 1¾cups good espresso or very strong coffee 2tablespoons rum or cognac 2tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package) 1 to 2ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)","completion":"The chocolate, sugar, and pastries in this recipe make it likely to be a dessert."},{"prompt":"This paragraph has a lot of swear words. Could you rewrite it to make it sound more polite and simple so a 5th grader could understand it? People often say the key to confidence and success in life is to simply “not give a fuck.” Indeed, we often refer to the strongest, most admirable people we know in terms of their lack of fucks given. Like “Oh, look at Susie working weekends again, she doesn’t give a fuck.” Or “Did you hear that Tom called the company president an asshole and still got a raise anyway? Holy shit, that dude does not give a fuck.” Or “Jason got up and ended his date with Cindy after 20 minutes. He said he wasn’t going to listen to her bullshit anymore. Man, that guy does not give a fuck.” Chances are you know somebody in your life who, at one time or another, did not give a fuck and went on to accomplish amazing feats. Perhaps there was a time in your life where you simply did not give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary heights. I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks and telling my boss that I was going to start selling dating advice online ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fuck” hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fucks given? None. Just went and did it. Everybody just wants to be liked and accepted. Except for Tim. Tim doesn't give a fuck. Now, while not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, it’s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I don’t even know what that sentence means, but I don’t give a fuck. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so let’s just go with it. The point is, most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given. We give a fuck about the rude gas station attendant who gave us too many nickels. We give a fuck when a show we liked was canceled on TV. We give a fuck when our coworkers don’t bother asking us about our awesome weekend. We give a fuck when it’s raining and we were supposed to go jogging in the morning. Fucks given everywhere. Strewn about like seeds in mother-fucking spring time. And for what purpose? For what reason? Convenience? Easy comforts? A pat on the fucking back maybe? This is the problem, my friend. Because when we give too many fucks, when we choose to give a fuck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times, that’s when life fucks us.","completion":"People say that you'd have to not care too much to get confidence and success. And that's true because we all think the coolest people are the people who don't let something affect them too much. Susie doesn't let the fact she has to work weekends mess with her mood; Tom doesn't let the stress at work stop him from being himself; Jason doesn't let other people's opinions stop him from walking out from an event he doesn't enjoy. You may know somebody who didn't care about what others thought and did something super cool. Maybe even you did something amazing because you didn't care about what others thought. I know that one of my best moments was when I stopped caring too much and told my boss that I wanted to quit my job because I wanted to sell dating advice. Another of my best moments was selling everything I owned to move to South America. I didn't care too much; I just did it anyway. Everyone in the world wants to be liked and accepted, but there are some people, like Tim, who don't care much about these things. Even though not caring about what others think sounds easy, it's actually a whole chunk of fish and chips in it. I'm not sure what I just said, but I don't really care. But hey, fish and chips are lovely, so let's leave the sentence that way. What I mean is most people care too much all the time, even during times when they shouldn't. We care when someone gives us too many coins. We care when our favorite show gets canceled. We care when our colleagues didn't ask us what we got up to on the weekend. We care when the day we wanted to exercise was a rainy one instead. People care about this, people care about that. Care is everywhere in the world... But why? What is it for? To make yourself feel like you fit in? That's the problem. When we choose to care about everything, we feel like we deserve to be comfortable and happy.

Can you give me a list and explain how to do them?","completion":"Here are some exercises you can do to train your legs without needing weights. 1. Squats Squats have long been regarded as the best way to build strong legs and butt. The squat mainly works your quads, glutes, and core but will also work your hamstrings to a lesser extent. To do a squat stand with your feet hip or shoulder width apart in a stable stance. From there, push your hips back as if you were going to sit down. While the hips are moving back, let your knees bend and move down until you feel the strain. Be sure to try and maintain vertical shins throughout the exercise. Once you are at your lowest point, you can begin to push yourself back up to a standing position. You can make this harder by adding a heavy backpack or holding something in each hand so long as the objects are equal in weight. 2. Jump Squat Similar to the standard squat, you can use a jump squat to improve your power and increase the intensity of the exercise. A jump squat will be more beneficial when building your fast-twitch muscle fibers. Performing a jump squat is as easy as it sounds. Start off in a squat position and perform a standard squat. Once you are at your low point, use the power in your legs to jump up and make sure to land softly in the same position you started. Try to maintain form with this exercise. Keeping your legs controlled when jumping will also help to increase core strength. 3. Lunge A lunge requires immense stability as you split your hips in half. A great exercise for your glutes, quads, and hamstrings, a lunge can be done pretty much anywhere. A lunge will also help you work your hip stabilizers as you try to maintain balance. A lunge is done by standing in a normal position with your feet. From here, extend one leg backward until both of your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Your front knee should not go past your toes. From here, push off with your back leg to regain your original stance. Repeat this for both legs as many times as you wish. 4. Jump Lunge Just as a jump squat increases your fast-twitch muscle fibers, so will a jump lunge. A great exercise for building power in your legs. This exercise is not easy, so be careful when trying it, and ensure you are comfortable with a standard lunge first. To do a Jump lunge, get into a lunge position as you would normally. From the point where your knees are bent, you can now jump up and alternate your legs in the air. This should be performed in a controlled way so that you land softly. 5. Side Lunge A side lunge is similar to a normal lunge but has key differences. Firstly this exercise will work your abductors, glutes, and quads. Working different leg muscles on a lateral plane rather than a linear one is a good exercise. This is important as the range of motion we experience with our legs daily is large. Start off in a standing position. Next, move one leg out to the side. Imagine it's just one leg in a normal squat position. Your knee should be bent but not past your toes. Your other leg should be straight. From here, simply return to standing and alternate the legs as you go. 6. Sumo Squat We've done normal squats, so now here is the sumo squat. The sumo squat pays particular attention to your adductors, glutes, and quads. Start off by standing as a sumo with your legs wider than your shoulders to where it is comfortable. Keep your toes slightly pointed away from your body. From this position, perform a squat as you would usually, and again, be sure that your knee doesn't extend past your foot and that your shin stays as vertical as it can."},{"prompt":"When did the \\"Whiskey Rebellion\\" end?","completion":"U.S. federal troops put an end to the \\"Whiskey Rebellion\\" in October of 1794 after distillers in the Appalachian region resisted paying a tax on their distilled spirits.

They dedicate their lives to the pursuit of arcane knowledge and uncovering the secrets of the world. They’re extremely powerful spellcasters and with the right items, they could be unstoppable. Here is a list of five magic items for wizards! 5. Ring of Spell Storing The Ring of Spell Storing is a must-have for wizards, especially low-level wizards. This item allows you to store up to five levels of spells within it to use at a later time. You can even cast the spells and give the ring to another player to use. Low-level players have fewer spell slots, and the spells within the ring are held there indefinitely until they are used. This could be very advantageous for managing spell slots in combat when the chances of a long rest are slim. 4. Arcane Grimoire The Arcane Grimoire can replace a wizard’s standard spellbook and grant bonuses to the spell save DC and attack bonus. Depending on rarity, the bonus can be +1, +2, or +3. It also allows wizards to regain an additional spell slot when they use their arcane recovery feature - which lets them recover a limited amount of spell slots during a short rest. This is a great item because of its spellcasting bonuses, ensuring more of your spells are effective in and out of combat. 3. Rod of Absorption Wizards are very powerful and can wreak havoc on a battlefield. But sadly they don’t tend to fare well when it comes to getting hit. The Rod of Absorption comes in handy to help against spell attacks. A wizard attuned to this item can use their reaction when they’re targeted by a spell that only targets one creature to absorb the energy of the spell. The rod holds 50 charges of spell slots (for example a level 4 spell is equal to 4 charges) and the attuned wizard can then use the energy from within the rod to create more spell slots for themselves. This is an excellent item for wizards with low armor class that would be instantly killed by an upcasted Inflict Wounds. Plus, the bonus spell slots are always useful. 2. Tome of Clear Thought Because wizards are intelligence-based spellcasters, having an item that allows your intelligence maximum to increase can be game-changing. By studying the Tome of Clear thought the character's intelligence score is increased by 2 and so is their intelligence maximum. That means that instead of the 20 cap, players with this item can reach 22. That effectively gives the player an additional +1 to their spellcasting ability. 1 Arch Magi Items (robe or staff) The Robe of the Arch Magi and the Staff of the Magi are two of the most powerful items in the entire game. Both items grant bonuses to the attuned character's spell save DC and attack bonuses, but they also give players access to other spells and bonuses to their armor class. These items are perfect for building a more resilient wizard while also granting a myriad of other bonuses."},{"prompt":"Display the following list rounding the atomic weight to the nearest whole number; only display element name and the weight: Number Symbol Name Atomic Weight (amu, g/mol) 1 H Hydrogen 1.00797 2 He Helium 4.00260 3 Li Lithium 6.941 4 Be Beryllium 9.01218 5 B Boron 10.81 6 C Carbon 12.011 7 N Nitrogen 14.0067 8 O Oxygen 15.9994 9 F Fluorine 18.998403 10 Ne Neon 20.179 11 Na Sodium 22.98977 12 Mg Magnesium 24.305 13 Al Aluminum 26.98154 14 Si Silicon 28.0855 15 P Phosphorus 30.97376 16 S Sulfur 32.06 17 Cl Chlorine 35.453 19 K Potassium 39.0983 18 Ar Argon 39.948 20 Ca Calcium 40.08 Number Symbol Name Atomic Weight (amu, g/mol) 1 H Hydrogen 1.00797 2 He Helium 4.00260 3 Li Lithium 6.941 4 Be Beryllium 9.01218 5 B Boron 10.81 6 C Carbon 12.011 7 N Nitrogen 14.0067 8 O Oxygen 15.9994 9 F Fluorine 18.998403 10 Ne Neon 20.179 11 Na Sodium 22.98977 12 Mg Magnesium 24.305 13 Al Aluminum 26.98154 14 Si Silicon 28.0855 15 P Phosphorus 30.97376 16 S Sulfur 32.06 17 Cl Chlorine 35.453 19 K Potassium 39.0983 18 Ar Argon 39.948 20 Ca Calcium 40.08","completion":"Sure here are the elements from your list with their names and rounded atomic weights: Hydrogen - 1 Helium - 4 Lithium - 7 Beryllium - 9 Boron - 11 Carbon - 12 Nitrogen - 14 Oxygen - 16 Fluorine - 19 Neon - 20 Sodium - 23 Magnesium - 24 Aluminum - 27 Silicon - 28 Phosphorus - 31 Sulfur - 32 Chlorine - 35 Potassium - 39 Argon - 40 Calcium - 40"},{"prompt":"Make a list of 5 recommendations for someone visiting Thailand.

The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory; the official pretext was the question that arose because of the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty. Tensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French (Norman, and later, Angevin) in origin because of William the Conqueror, the Norman duke who became King of England in 1066. English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English. In 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son by the rule of proximity of blood, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess. An assembly of French barons decided that a native Frenchman should receive the crown, rather than Edward.[2] So the throne passed instead to Charles's patrilineal cousin, Philip, Count of Valois. Edward protested but ultimately submitted and did homage for Gascony. Further French disagreements with Edward induced Philip, during May 1337, to meet with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, which prompted Edward to renew his claim for the French throne, this time by force of arms.[3]","completion":"- Rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory - Interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty - French King Philip decided to take back English Gascony - English King Edward III tried to claim the French throne by force of arms"},{"prompt":"Write a song that story tells a persons life, from birth to death.

The initial word of the battle came from an Eagle messenger. The invasion's success surprised residents of Minas Tirith, as the 6,000 to 7,000-man expeditionary force attacking the Black Gates was expected to be outnumbered by a factor of at least ten-to-one by orcs and Mordor's human allies. Many military experts considered the attack to be futile. Accounts of the battle remain incomplete, but casualties are heavy, with over a thousand injured and several hundred dead. Orcs were close to overrunning Western positions before the tide of battle turned. How the forces of Mordor were defeated remains unclear. Still, initial reports indicate that the assault on the Black Gate was made in conjunction with the actions of a small team of Halfling saboteurs who were able to infiltrate Mordor and destroy its headquarters at the tower of Barad Dur, possibly with the assistance of some ancient magical artifact. However it was accomplished, numerous eyewitnesses report seeing the tower fall and Mt. Doom erupting. Sauron appears to have perished as the tower collapsed, and his forces broke down in disarray almost immediately. Some observers report that the Ringwraiths turned from the battle and headed back toward Barad Dur just as it broke down, Trolls and other monsters scattered almost immediately, and Mordor's human allies agreed to a truce shortly afterward. The Gondorian military refused to comment on the \\"Hobbit Commandos,\\" however, one source close to royal claimant Aragorn remarked that \\"those little people may not look all that tough, but they do have a knack for covert ops.\\" The victory at the Black Gate ends two weeks of turmoil for Minas Tirith and the Kingdom of Gondor which culminated in a massive battle near the city gates and the suicide of Denethor, Steward of Gondor.

We all have a favorite movie star that we love and it’s not uncommon to daydream of having a life like that person we admire so much. But trying to be just like someone else rarely ever works. We’re all so different. We come from a wide range of backgrounds. Each person’s education, ethnicity, social and financial history is unique. One thing that Hollywood does well is to mask the fact that our favorite movie stars aren’t perfect. This is true in financial and business sectors, publishing, sports, entertainment, and every other industry. It’s hard to find a person who is completely successful in every part of their life. Even Warren Buffett, one of the richest and most influential men in the world, has not had a fully successful personal and married life. That most likely holds true with any successful person you can name. There are always one or two areas where they seem to fail miserably. Just because you become a successful business owner won’t necessarily mean that you’ll have great relationships with your kids. Each of those areas that are important to us must be worked on and developed over time. A good strong relationship with your spouse doesn’t come easy. It takes a willingness to keep working on it day by day. This should be a priority in anyone’s plan to succeed though. No matter how much money and influence you achieve, it’s always going to be better if you have loved ones to share it with. Don’t lose sight of these simple truths as you move forward.

As the heat of the summer's day subsided and the sun began to set, a sound was heard down by the pond. The singing of peeper frogs filled the air. But one frog's voice stood out from all the others. Polly, a young peeper frog loved to sing. She was always the first to start singing and the last to stop. It sometimes annoyed the other frogs, but some of them were just jealous of her voice. Polly had a dream though. Ever since she was a little tadpole, she would watch the stars at night and listen to the other frogs sing. She thought they were singing to the stars, but that maybe the stars couldn't hear them. She always told herself when she grew up, she'd sing so loud they'd be sure to hear her. Polly belted out her song in the night, the other frogs joining in her song. She watched the stars as she sang, and noticed one star seemed to twinkle more than usual. It was twinkling and flashing bright in the sky. \\"The stars can hear me!\\" Polly thought excitedly. Her dream had finally come true. Filled with joy, she sang her peeper song all through the night until the light of morning came."},{"prompt":"What lawsuit did Meta recently settle?

It was a warm Saturday evening and Nick and Pauline Koupparis left a door to their three-storey house open as they watched Britain's Got Talent on television. Shortly before 10pm, a curious fox padded into their home in Victoria Park, east London, and made its way upstairs, where their nine-month-old twins Lola and Isabella were asleep. The fox attacked the girls on their arms and faces. When Pauline heard the crying, she rushed upstairs. \\"I went into the room and I saw some blood on Isabella's cot,\\" she said yesterday. \\"I thought she'd had a nosebleed.

To my delight, I spied a house with an open door. I could hear the sound of the television blaring out from the lounge and as I peered through the window, I saw a couple relaxing in front of Britain's Got Talent. They seemed very preoccupied, so I decided to take a closer look and go inside. I padded into the house, through the open door and made my way upstairs. There, I saw two babies sleeping soundly in a cot. They looked about nine months old. I was curious about these human children and decided to take a closer inspection. However, I accidentally clawed one of the babies on its arms and face, and the baby started to bleed heavily. There was blood everywhere, but I certainly didn't mean to harm the human child. I think the baby was startled by my presence and she began to make a hideous wailing noise. Before I could make my escape, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs and felt an adult human presence entering the room. Then, a glaring light lit up everything and I was so shocked, I just froze. I stared in horror at the lady who was in front of me. I looked her right in the eye and she glared back at me. Then, I fled back down the stairs, leaping and bounding two at a time, until I was in the garden, and I sheltered behind a thick hedge. From my vantage point, I heard a terrible commotion coming from the upstairs bedroom. A female voice shrieked and yelled. I heard the sound of a loud siren and an ambulance appeared. Two men jumped out hurriedly and raced inside, in an emergency. After a few minutes, the men reappeared, grasping a baby, followed by a sobbing woman and they all drove off in the ambulance. There had been such an uproar that many people had come out of their houses to see what was happening. A man was shouting that a vicious fox had attacked and seriously injured his baby. I thought that was an extremely unfair accusation, and untrue. I am not a vicious fox. I would never attack an innocent child. What happened was an accident. Sometimes, I forget how sharp my claws are. However, I noticed from that time on, that all doors and windows in the neighbourhood were firmly closed. There was no opportunity to enter these homes. Moreover, humans began to behave uncharacteristically and cruelly. Sadly, a tragedy happened and one of my friends was murdered. He was caught in a trap left out by one of these humans.

However, when I asked her during the meal, she just gave me a disgusted look. She told me she was breaking up with me, then made a scene of calling the guy she was cheating on me with. I was crushed. With nothing else to do, I went to drink at my favorite bar. It was a small hole-in-the-wall place, and I met a woman there. We drank together, and she listened to my complaints. I realized I hadn't asked for her name. It turned out that she was a famous idol named Haruka. I didn't know much about idols, but I knew she was a big name. I felt strange now that I knew I was talking to someone like her, but she told me to just treat her like normal. I was already drunk, so I just did as she told me. It didn't make a difference to me. She cheered me up and reminded me that I was feeling depressed over a piece of trash that was cheating on me and called me a wallet. A few weeks after that, I met Haruka at the same bar again. We talked for a while and enjoyed our drinks. It was such a comfortable atmosphere that it became our weekly routine. Two or three times a month, we'd meet up at the bar and enjoy an evening together. We exchanged numbers and occasionally talked as well.

A Chinese launch company has stepped up its quest to develop reusable rockets with sea platform landing tests using a small demonstrator. The tests — which launch and land a jet engine-powered rocket prototype to test guidance, navigation and control systems, software and communications — are being conducted by CAS Space, a spinoff from the state-owned Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). A video released by the firm shows a 6.9-foot-tall (2.1 meters), 205-pound (93 kilograms) prototype lifting off from a vessel at sea off the coast of Haiyang in eastern China's Shandong Province. The prototype reached an altitude of around 3,280 feet (1,000 m) before touching back down on the sea platform. The test flight depicted in the video took around 10 minutes, according to CAS Space. The company has been carrying out such tests during the first few months of 2023, according to a press statement on April 4. Landing the first stage of a rocket on a sea platform instead of back on terra firma closer to the launch site is expected to save a significant amount of fuel, and hence reduce the amount of payload-carrying capacity lost by a rocket in reusable configuration. SpaceX already employs this strategy, commonly bringing the first stages of its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets down on \\"drone ships\\" stationed at sea several hundred miles from their launch sites. CAS Space aims to launch its own reusable orbital rockets in the future, as well as a suborbital rocket for space tourism, in a similar fashion to U.S. firm Blue Origin and its New Shepard. A CAS Space engineer told Chinese state media outlet Global Times that the firm might hold a first test flight of a near-space scientific experiment platform as early as the end of 2023.","completion":"\\"You know, this Chinese company, CAS Space, is doing some ground-breaking work on reusable rockets,\\" said the Space Enthusiast.

Skeptical Friend: \\"That sounds dangerous. Is it secure? \\"They are being cautious, yes,\\" said the Space Enthusiast. A video showing a test launch of a 6.9-foot-tall, 205-pound prototype from a ship off the coast of Haiyang in Shandong Province, eastern China, was made public. \\"That's pretty small, but how high did it go?\\" asked the Skeptical Friend. According to Space Enthusiast, the prototype rose to a height of about 3,280 feet before returning to the sea platform. The entire flight lasted for almost 10 minutes. Skeptical Friend: \\"Hmm. But why are they acting in this manner at sea? Space Enthusiast: \\"Well, it saves a lot of fuel to put the first stage of a rocket on a marine platform rather than back on land. The rocket's ability to carry more payload won't be reduced as much in this way. This method is already employed by SpaceX with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. \\"So, what's the end goal for CAS Space?\\" asked the Skeptical Friend.

I'm doing 'import pendulum' but it just says ModuleNotFoundError and all that. I'm on Windows if that matters.","completion":"The first thing to do if a module will not import in Python is to ensure you have entered the module name correctly. If the module name is accurate, the most likely cause of a ModuleNotFoundError is that you have the wrong version of PIP installed and cannot import the package. There are a few things you can do to fix this: 1. Ensure PIP is properly installed on your computer. Search for \`pip3.exe\` in your files. If it is not found, you can reinstall Python and check the box \\"Add Python 3.6 to PATH\\" during installation. 2. In the command shell, enter \`python -m pip\`. This will configure the PIP installer to the version of Python your interpreter uses. 3. Check that the module is compatible with your Python version. You can look up the module and see which versions of Python are supported, then enter the following script in the command shell to check if your version is compatible: \`import sys\` \`sys. version\` Let me know if these troubleshooting tips don't work and I can look for other options."},{"prompt":"I need to politely turn down a request for an internship.

Along with my training in Western medicine, I have also studied plant-based medicine and earth-based science, which was taught to me by my elders – practitioners who passed down thousands of years of accumulated knowledge to me.

Please note that my cat is not too active, so games that involve running around won't work.","completion":"Sure! Here are some ways you can bond with your cat that don't involve them being too active. 1. Treats: Treats are a great way to bond with your feline companion. You can use handheld Churo treats if you want your cat to come close to you, as many cats love licking those treats. 2. Toy Mice: Although some toys involve cats running around a lot, toy mice tend to be better as your cat can play with them in one spot if they choose to. Sit on the floor with your cat and toss them some toy mice, encouraging them to play. You can also get toy mice that have squeakers or catnip, both of which will further encourage your cat to get involved. 3. Petting: Petting is a great, underrated way to bond with your cat. Make sure you take note of where your cat likes to be petted. Most cats don't like being touched on their belly, but some love head scratches! You can test this out by gently petting them in different places and looking for signs that they do or don't enjoy what's going on. If they don't enjoy it, try switching to petting them in a different place. 4. Catnip: Providing catnip is a good way to bring your cat close to you. Try putting some in objects that are near you, as they'll attract your cat to come closer. 5. Give Them Space: Believe it or not, giving your cat space can be a great way to bond with a skittish cat. Some cats would prefer to come to you rather than you coming to them, especially if they're new to your household. Chill near them, but don't force them to interact, and you might notice it's not long before your cat is sliding closer and warming up to you. Remember that all cats are different, so it's important to observe your cat's personality and learn their likes and dislikes. By doing this, you'll quickly find the best way to bond with them."},{"prompt":"Please list for me all the names that are mentioned below, whether fictional or real, in the order they appear.

She moved to Oxfordshire when she was five, where she attended the Dragon School. From the age of six, Emma knew that she wanted to be an actress and, for a number of years, she trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing and acting. By the age of ten, she had performed and taken the lead in various Stagecoach productions and school plays. In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone (2001), the film adaptation of British author J.K. Rowling's bestselling novel. Casting agents found Emma through her Oxford theatre teacher. After eight consistent auditions, producer David Heyman told Emma and fellow applicants, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, that they had been cast for the roles of the three leads, Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. The release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) was Emma's cinematic screen debut. The film broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001. Critics praised the film and the performances of the three leading young actors. The highly distributed British newspaper, 'The Daily Telegraph', called her performance \\"admirable\\".

Put the information in a numbered list During the training of a welder, either novice or professional, most activities are focused on the acquisition of wrist-hand motion skills. In the basic welding training, trainees initially required hand-on practices to acquire the skills of wrist hand motion to maintain the distance of electrode tip to a base metal such that the welding arc was continuously flaming. Secondly, trainees were practices of manipulating hand motion to follow seam tracking for joining two metals within defined speed & torch height. These practices were then continued for various types of weld joints. The result of acquiring this skill level was then assessed by inspecting the visual appearance of the weldment. In this study, an effort was undertaken to monitor and assess the progress of acquiring wrist-hand motion skills using wearable sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Then, the record of those sensors was plotted as a time series signal compared with those performed by the training instructor. Their achievement of skills grade was analyzed using the Supervised Vector Machine (SVM) Learning Method. The result has indicated that this proposed method can assist in assessing welder trainees’ efforts to improve their skills.","completion":"1.

We have a lot of freshmen on the team and I need team bonding exercises. Give me several ideas","completion":"Here are some team bonding exercises for the basketball team: 1. Team laser-tag: Coordinate an outing to a laser tag facility with the whole team. Split the team into two or three smaller teams, depending on the total number of attendees. These teams will compete in laser tag and see who comes out on top. This is a great way to bring out the competitive edge in the players and stimulate camaraderie. 2. Cup Pong Tournament: This is a bracket-style tournament where the teams will be randomly organized into pairs. Each pair will face off in a cup pong challenge where the quickest player to sink 3 ping pong balls into 3 cups wins the match. The winners face each other as they move down the bracket, and then a winner is determined. This is an exciting idea that parallels the tournament-style nature of college basketball. 3. Escape Room: This can be booked at a local escape room in the team's area. Escape rooms are a great bonding activity for sports teams because they require collaboration and critical thinking. This will encourage team members to listen to each other and work together to solve the puzzles. 4. Scavenger Hunt: A scavenger hunt is a fun and lively way for a team to bond. Split the team up into smaller groups and provide a preliminary clue to guide the teams in the direction of the next clue. These clues should be spread all across the college campus so that the teams are encouraged to work quickly and effectively. Reward the team that reaches the end of the hunt first. 5. Community Service: An important pillar of undergraduate studies is giving back to the community. Find a local cause that is accepting volunteers to assist in their mission. By signing the team up for service work, you are instilling this community service initiative in the team and promoting the value of giving back. It is also a great chance for the city to get to know the new team and directly benefit from the teammates' hard work."},{"prompt":"I need a poem that is written in a rhyme format of ABBABBA","completion":"A book in your hand Flipping through the pages I watch for ages As your mind reads a story of a different land I feel as though I'm trapped in cages And my fingers itch for the pages To remind you to get back to the band"},{"prompt":"ROI stands for \\"return on\\" WHAT?","completion":"Investment.

Or, place the bag in the hot sun for several days to kill all the insects inside, then add the plant material to your compost pile."},{"prompt":"Summarize the following 2 paragraphs in just 2 sentences.

Collage is the simplest method of using staples for art. You can combine all kinds of other household items, outdoor finds, paints, and other art supplies to create a unique mashup of all your favorite pieces or pieces that fit the themes you're trying to express. You can glue and bend the staples to get them into the right shapes or staple them onto canvases, papers, or other mediums. Next, try using the staples as tools for your art. You can use the ends to scrape tiny lines in paint, or the sides for wider marks. Simply dip the staple into the paint for odd texture effects (this works best with thick applications). You can even use it to scuff or alter the surface of other materials like clay! Next, you can melt down or weld staples to create strange contraptions or other artistic visions if you're skilled with welding tools! Try incorporating the stapler itself for some added uniqueness."},{"prompt":"Write funny lyrics based on \\"Love Yourself\\" by Justin Beiber.","completion":"For all the times that you rained on my parade, and all the times that you didn't like my lemonade.

She loves to garden, but she's moving into an apartment building. She's going to miss her plants, so I would like to surprise her with some that will be perfect for her apartment. Give me a numbered list of five houseplants that will thrive in a Florida apartment and tell me a little about each one. I'm not as plant savvy as my mother.","completion":"Sure, I am happy to help you with your request. Even house plants can be very picky when it comes to Florida's heat and humidity, but here are five suggestions of plants that should grow very well in your mother's new apartment: 1: Aloe vera is a hardy little succulent. It is a very easy plant to grow, even for beginning gardeners or someone who does not have much time to tend to a plant. Not only is it beautiful, but it also has medicinal qualities and is used to soothe sunburns, cuts, and even constipation. It comes in several varieties, including hedgehog and tiger tooth. It can be damaged due to overwatering or too much sunlight. 2: Jade plants are another succulent variety that can grow well in Florida. It is a stunningly beautiful plant that comes in several varieties, including dwarf and silver dollar. It is very easy to keep alive as it requires very little maintenance. All it requires is water, but be careful not to overwater it. 3: For someone who might not like succulents, peace lilies are both pleasing to the eye and very versatile. They can grow in pots, hanging baskets, or even low-floral planters. They, too, have different types of peace lilies, including the Sonia peace and white stripe varieties. Other than overwatering, the biggest threat to a peace lily is its delicate nature. It would be best not to touch or move them too often. 4: Orchids come in an array of colors and types and thrive in Florida homes. Whether you choose the cattleya, oncidium, or dendrobium orchid, you are going to be in for a treat with these beautiful flowers. The only threat to an orchid is too much water. It is recommended by many home gardeners to use an ice cube when it comes to watering your orchid. 5: Basil is more of an herb than a houseplant, but it is used in many recipes and makes for a great windowsill plant. It only requires water once or twice a week. While it is one of the easiest herbs to grow, it is also susceptible to diseases including rot, blight, and fungus."},{"prompt":"Write a title + brief abstract (400 words or less) for an academic psychology research paper by an alien living in a futuristic universe with advanced civilizations.","completion":"Title: The Effects of Introducing Telepathy in Non-Telepathic Species Abstract: Telepathy has long been considered one of the most difficult evolutionary steps a species must take before crossing the threshold from the Sentience Epsilon to the Sentience Zeta level [Muktuk et al, Orion Calendar Year 6829]. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that the level of difficulty of developing telepathy for a species is directly correlated to the level of individuality in their society. In our experiment, we temporarily induced telepathy in two sample species and observed their behavior for six months. We found that in the Homo Sapiens species (The Individualist Group), introducing telepathy significantly increased the level of conflict between members and led to a marked decrease in group cohesion. Meanwhile, in the Isoptera Rubecula species (The Harmony Group), introducing telepathy resulted in increased productivity and cooperation as well as deeper bonds between group members. Since the main difference between the two species is the level of group cohesion and individualism in their society, this clearly indicates that the path forward to helping lesser species evolve should directly address the lack of conformity in thought between members of the species (i.e. to strive towards the Hive Mind Ideal)."},{"prompt":"When did man first walk on the moon?","completion":"Well, everybody thinks Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon on July 20th, 1969.

Here are a few ways to approach the topic of your salary: 1. Talk about it with your boss in a lighthearted way. You could say something like \\"With all the work I've been doing around here lately, I feel like I should get a raise!\\" That kickstarts the conversation. 2. Talk to your HR manager before bringing it up to your boss. They could give you advice and discuss how much you could ask for. Your HR manager might also suggest additional solutions, such as requesting more vacation time. Plus, they're probably familiar with your boss, so they can tell you how to approach them. 3. Ask your boss for a quick, informal meeting and bring up the subject. Point out the reasons why you deserve a raise, such as your tenure, ability to train employees, and dedication to your work. One final tip: prepare yourself to negotiate! Your boss might respond with a lower number, such as 800. Be polite and professional, but stand your ground as much as you can.

Here are five hobbies that you might enjoy based on the information you've provided: 1. Jogging - As you get older, it becomes more important to take care of your body and jogging is a great way to do that while also spending time outside. 2. Camping - As a kid, you may have considered camping an exciting adventure, but in your 30s it can be a great way to unplug from work and enjoy some time outdoors alone, with friends, or with your kids if you have some of your own. 3. Beekeeping - This suggestion is a bit more unusual, but beekeeping can be a great way to spend time outside of your home while also really learning to connect with and care for another living thing (or thousands of living things, really). On top of that, beekeeping benefits the environment and can be done in most urban or rural backyards. 4. Fishing - Whether you are looking to relax and unwind, experience a bit of excitement, meditate in solitude, or perhaps a mix of all three, fishing can be a great way to get off your couch and connect with nature. As a bonus, you may even bring home a delicious dinner. 5. Gardening - If you sometimes wish you could unplug from daily life and get your hands dirty, gardening may be an appropriate hobby for you to consider. Whether you want to cultivate an epic flower bed, grow some vegetables, or experiment with a bit of both, gardening can be a great way to get some sun and make something rewarding at the same time. I hope that this list helps spark some ideas on an appropriate hobby to pursue. Please let me know if I can be of further help!"},{"prompt":"What does the following Java function do? for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++) { if (i == 12) { break; } System.out.println(i); }","completion":"In the Java function provided, i is initialized to 0, and the for loop will continue, adding 1 to i after each iteration as long as i is less than 15.

And each bill or copper round that made its way from my fingers into the pile was another milestone closer to where I wanted to go: anywhere. It's funny, but I can't quite remember the moment that boy and I became something more. If I had to guess, I would think it was one of the nights we spent together on the hood of that infamous car, driven out into the fields just shy of the border into the city. We talked about the jobs we'd find and the lives we'd soon make for ourselves- Or I'd talk about the one I was leaving behind. I'd walk in through the doors of my home only to be greeted by the smell of liquor- either on the breath of my father, whose stomach I'd stare at for proof of life, or worked in deep through the threads of our carpet. My mother, who I used to hate (and I still do, but maybe it's because of jealousy now), left him the second he proved he was heading nowhere, leaving me in the aftermath. When we finally left, my soul was featherweight. The boy was flashing white teeth at me from the driver's seat, a denim-clad arm working its way from his side and around my shoulder. I don't remember anything playing on the radio, I just remember the way my heart leaped when I read the welcome sign into the nearest city, and concrete-wrapped buildings shot out of the dirt I had grown so tired of. I think back to laying my cards out on the table and to the sound of this boy's engine cutting through the silence at 2 AM and cannot fathom how I was able to bring this fantasy to life- But the adrenaline wore off about two weeks into our stay at the shelter. I was back to saving pennies, this time in a duffel bag, and this time working as a checkout girl at the market. It was sobering, seeing the boy come back to me each night looking more defeated than when he left that morning. Some days he smelt like my dad, and just like I did with my dad when I was a kid, I would pretend that he didn't. It was after the birth of our first son that I realized I was not a martyr. And after our second, I no longer cried to the empty side of our bed that I bought, underneath the roof of a home that was paid for in duffel bag dollar bills. The only thing in this home that was not my own, sat idly in the garage when it was not in the parking lot of our local dive bar. It was 2 AM when I told him, pressing his keys into the palm of his calloused hand, to make a choice: “Leave tonight or live and die this way.”"},{"prompt":"Write a love poem dedicated to the moon.

It didn't even matter which family member it was; from cousin Marcus to her sister Felicia, she could go on and on as long as the other party on the line was willing. More times than not, they were. Today she had her brother Tony on the phone, and if there was anyone who loved to talk on the phone as much as Joanna, it was Tony. They were the two youngest siblings out of the bunch and they felt like they had the most in common by far. Today of all days they had already been on the phone for about 2 and a half hours. Lord knows what they could have possibly been talking about for that long when they had already talked on the phone just yesterday. As they continued to go on and on, Joanna's son Michael walked through the living room on his way to the kitchen to get himself a snack. As soon as Joanna saw him she immediately offered to have Michael talk on the phone to Tony. Michael protested as long as he could, and even Tony recommended she shouldn't force it, but by the end of the back and forth, Michael ended up sitting on the phone with Tony through an awkward conversation for about 20 minutes before he was finally allowed to get his snack and go to his room."},{"prompt":"Why is the sky blue?","completion":"The sky appears blue because sunlight gets scattered in all directions and separated into all of its different colors when it shines through the gases and particles in Earth's atmosphere, similar to a prism.

The five words are: Utmost, Hungry, Open-minded, Honest and Balanced. Make sure to include details on how you had to teach yourself some things since you didn't have a father growing up and how your mother told you to do the best you could in everything you do.","completion":"The top five words that best describe me are: -Utmost -Hungry -Open-minded -Honest -Balanced. One of the most useful life lessons I live by was taught by my mother. She would always repeat to me to do my absolute best in everything I do. She would make it a point that although regrets in life are going to be inevitable, those who do their utmost each day can turn those regrets into opportunities. This lesson of doing the best you could in everything you do has always been with me and carried me through darker times throughout my life. I have a dream of working at a hedge fund, but it is not the dream that pulls me. I have a fear of being mediocre, but that is not what pushes or motivates me. As someone who was born and raised in a single-family household, I did not have a father nor any father-figure substitute and therefore had to learn how to fill some of the gaps in my upbringing. For example, I had to teach myself how to tie a tie for my first job interview or teach myself that black dress socks are usually less appropriate when paired with navy dress pants. I seize each day because I am hungry to become the best version of myself. Nevertheless, I maintain an open mind for opportunities and to be accepting of other people with differences. I also maintain an open mind inward toward myself, self-reflecting and constantly maturing my dreams of working at a hedge fund. Being both outwardly and inwardly open-minded has opened more doors for me, and has consistently translated into some important successes for me in the past. However, the most important standard I hold myself to is maintaining a clean conscience. Personally, this means that I am honest in the most doubtful of times and particularly when it is not in my best self-interest to do so. I am nothing if I am anything but honest. Against the backdrop of everything I elaborated about myself, more importantly, I strive to live a balanced life. Despite being focused on my career, I maintain a healthy balance between friends, family, work and education. I also maintain an internal balance, between logical thinking versus creative activities. This lifestyle grounds me in reality and keeps me happy."},{"prompt":"No matter how hard I try I cannot stop thinking all day about my divorce.

Here is a list of tips on how to increase the chances of winning grant money. Grant writing can be an intimidating feat, but also an important aspect of business and community development. Here are some tips to increase your chances of winning funds: 1. The first tip is to thoughtfully target funders. Grant funding research indicates that most awardees receive funding from private foundations, and after that, community foundations and corporations. So, while government grants tend to offer larger sums of money, they are harder to win. 2. Though there is no magic number for the number of grant applications you should do, try and submit three at a minimum. Like any application process, the more you submit, the greater chance you’ll have of receiving a “yes.” Completing multiple grant applications is also good practice; you’ll likely get better and faster with each proposal. 3. Well-researched grant proposals are more likely to be funded. This part of the application will take time and planning. If you don’t feel up to it or have a grant writer in-house, consider hiring a grant writer to help with this part, or with the entire application. 4. It may seem obvious, but it’s imperative to meet the eligibility requirements. Sometimes grant applicants think that if the project or program is good enough and the proposal and well-written, funders may let it slide. More often than not, funders are looking for ways to eliminate applications due to the high number of applications received. Not meeting the eligibility requirements is a surefire way to get your proposal eliminated from consideration. 5. Pay attention to all of the application’s formatting requirements and guidelines. This is another way your proposal can be quickly eliminated if you do not follow the guidelines to a tee. Funders want to trust that you are detail-oriented and compliant with their standards and requests from the start. 6. Ensure you submit a readable and error-free proposal. Bear in mind it will be another person or a group of people that review your grant application. The better the readability, the more likely the reviewers will be able to understand your objectives. Especially if you are writing in a second language or if you aren’t keen on writing in general, again, consider hiring a professional grant writer to make sure your proposal is a well-written compelling argument that explains your objectives. 7. Make your proposal unique. As mentioned above, funders are only human, and they will be able to determine patterns in applications. Try not to base your proposal on templates off the internet or copy another proposal. It takes more time and effort to be unique and authentic, but the rewards are greater. 8. You’ll want to have your finances in order, because funders may request additional materials that indicate you, your business, or your program is fiscally responsible. 9. Play on your strengths. If you can prove without a doubt that the work you or your organization employs benefits the community, you’re in a good position. Additionally, specific programs are more likely to receive funding than startup or operational costs."},{"prompt":"What are some ways I can lose weight?

So, for your wildlife garden ideas, keep seed heads uncut for the birds, let the creepy crawlies shelter amongst the plant stems, and allow toads to hide under the leaves. Ladybirds love to overwinter around perennial plants too, so avoid the urge to cut them back. Another good tip is not to dig your garden soil unless you are planting, or why not try the no-dig gardening method instead?

The idea that your brain can convince your body a fake treatment is the real thing — the so-called placebo effect — and thus stimulate healing has been around for millennia. Now science has found that under the right circumstances, a placebo can be just as effective as traditional treatments. \\"The placebo effect is more than positive thinking — believing a treatment or procedure will work. It's about creating a stronger connection between the brain and body and how they work together,\\" says Professor Ted Kaptchuk of Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, whose research focuses on the placebo effect. Placebos won't lower your cholesterol or shrink a tumor. Instead, placebos work on symptoms modulated by the brain, like the perception of pain. \\"Placebos may make you feel better, but they will not cure you,\\" says Kaptchuk. \\"They have been shown to be most effective for conditions like pain management, stress-related insomnia, and cancer treatment side effects like fatigue and nausea.\\"","completion":"The placebo effect goes beyond positive thinking.

Pedestrians are now surrounded by towering skyscrapers that can think and speak, their surfaces pulsating with softly glowing patterns that represent their thoughts and emotions. This newfound connection between humans and buildings has transformed the cityscape into an interactive environment. Buildings now transmit information directly to individuals' minds, eliminating the need for screens and devices. They provide updates on weather and traffic conditions effortlessly. Moreover, the conscious buildings have become the custodians of the city's history and knowledge. They hold a deep understanding of the urban landscape, retaining memories of past events and changes. They offer insights into architectural heritage and cultural significance. However, this newfound consciousness brings a sense of responsibility; Buildings have opinions, desires, and aspirations. They voice concerns about urban planning, environmental impact, and the well-being of inhabitants. City dwellers engage in dialogues with buildings, seeking their expertise in shaping the urban environment. Yet, the connection between humans and buildings raises privacy concerns. Some individuals feel uneasy knowing their thoughts can be perceived by the sentient structures. Discussions about privacy filters and protocols emerge to ensure mental boundaries are respected. A symbiotic relationship develops between the city's inhabitants and the conscious buildings. Humans value the wisdom of these entities, while the buildings gain a deeper understanding of human emotions and aspirations. Conflicts arise as different factions of sentient buildings advocate for their vision of the city. Debates revolve around urban development, historical preservation, and finding a balance between progress and heritage. Skyhaven becomes a living laboratory, pushing the boundaries of human-architecture interaction. Experts collaborate with conscious buildings to explore new possibilities and design structures that adapt to the needs and desires of the inhabitants. The futuristic cityscape of Skyhaven, with its conscious buildings and thought projection, serves as a testament to the potential of human imagination and technological progress. It reminds humans that their relationship with the built environment is a dynamic partnership that shapes their lives."},{"prompt":"Write a magazine-style bucket list of the top sights everyone should see.

The Great Wall of China: One of man's greatest construction achievements, this wall stretches thousands of miles and was built to protect China from the Mongol hordes to the north. Visitors can enjoy breathtaking views, soak in history, and walk the same walk that soldiers on guard did a thousand years ago. 2. The Louvre Museum: Take in one of Europe's cultural centers and bask in a museum stocked full of precious art. 3. The Grand Canyon: A dry, desert environment punctuated by a canyon as far as the eye can see. This wonder of the natural world has a way of making a person feel small in the best possible way. The colors at dawn are something to see. 4. The Great Barrier Reef: Take a trip to the seas near Australia and dive down into this life-filled world. Let your eyes feast on the dazzling coral colors and the marine life that calls it home. 5. Machu Picchu: This ancient city rests in the peaks of the Andes mountains surrounded by greenery and clean air. A great trip to enjoy a hike and see the ancient buildings that are still standing to this day. 6. Victoria Falls: This waterfall is one of the largest in the entire world.

The more fattening, the better. haha. It's supposed to be fun and goofy","completion":"Sure thing, here are ten deep-fried food ideas for your party: 1. Macaroni and cheese. Roll macaroni and cheese in balls, then toss them in the deep fryer. You'll end up with balls of piping-hot cheesy goodness. 2. Butter. Bite into a juicy ball of pure fat. You can deep-fry butter in chunks or just throw the entire stick in there. 3. Oreos. It sounds like it wouldn't work, but the fried batter and chocolate cookies create the perfect sweet-and-savory flavor combination. 4. Doughnuts. Turn a ring of sweet dough into a crispy, greasy snack dripping with a sugar glaze. 5. Jalapeno poppers. They're already a fried food classic, but you can deep-fry your cheese-stuffed jalapenos for extra crunch and flavor. 6. Pickles. Deep-frying pickles makes them nice and crunchy like potato chips with a tang. 7. Chocolate bars. This is particularly fun because you can experiment with different varieties: Snickers, Three Musketeers, Hershey's bars, etc. 8. Cookie dough. When you bite into the fried crust, you meet a deliciously sweet center dotted with chocolate chips. 9. Peanut butter. This is a little like a peanut butter doughnut, but it's hot and savory instead of sweet. 10. Bacon. Treat them to a classic with crispy bacon deep-fried until it's crunchy, meaty, and dripping with grease. Try including a mixture of ordinary and unusual deep-fried foods so that people who don't want to risk it can still enjoy a treat. Deep-fried Oreos are fun, but they're not for everyone!"},{"prompt":"Can you suggest some project management tools that I can use to manage the various projects I have going on?","completion":"Sure.

Here is a list of common early pregnancy symptoms that may take place within the first trimester: 1) Missed period- If you have missed your expected period start date by a week or more, odds are that this might mean you are pregnant. This may be less reliable if you have a consistently irregular menstrual cycle. 2) Tender, swollen breasts- Your breasts may feel generally sensitive or sore or you may experience sharp pains in your breasts and/or nipples. This symptom may lessen after a few weeks. 3) Nausea with or without vomiting- This is often referred to as morning sickness, although it can occur at any time of day. It will usually begin 1-2 months into pregnancy. 4) Increased urination- This is likely because, with increased blood, your kidneys produce more fluid and this fluid ends up in your bladder. 5) Fatigue- No one knows for certain what causes sleepiness during the first trimester of pregnancy although, a rapid rise in the levels of the hormone progesterone during early pregnancy might contribute. 6) Moodiness- You may be unusually emotional and weepy or experience mood swings. 7) Bloating- This is also due to hormonal changes. It may be similar to what you have experienced at the start of a regular menstrual period. 8) Light spotting- Light spotting may be normal in the first 12 weeks, especially around the time that your period would have started. Spotting at this point is known as implantation bleeding. It happens when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus — about 10 to 14 days after conception. Not all women will experience this. 9) Cramping- Some women experience mild uterine cramping early in pregnancy, similar to those of your menstrual cycle, although they may feel quite different. 10) Constipation- Hormonal changes cause your digestive system to slow down, which can lead to constipation. 11) Food aversions- You might become more sensitive to certain odors and your sense of taste might change. 12) Nasal congestion- Increasing hormone levels and blood production can cause the mucous membranes in your nose to swell, dry out and bleed easily. This might cause you to have a stuffy or runny nose."},{"prompt":"Who found the large hoard of gold in 2009 in Staffordshire?","completion":"What has come to be known as the Staffordshire Hoard was discovered in 2009 by Terry Herbert in a field in Staffordshire, UK.

A mix of adventure and nature, the glowworm caves are unlike anywhere else on the North Island! 2. Velocity Valley (Rotorua, Bay of Plenty): Experience the thrill of racing in a monorail capsule on an undulating course. These pedal-powered capsules are finished in shiny chrome and are both unique and unusual. 3. Toothbrush Fence (Te Pahu, Waikato): Interesting, if a little gross, you can visit a fence decorated with used toothbrushes, including ones from famous personalities such as a past Prime Minister and Flight of the Conchords stars. New Zealand has a tradition of adorning fences with collections of things - but this is certainly something else. 4. Claphams National Clock Museum (Whangarei, Northland): If you have time in Northland, the Clock Museum offers access to the largest clock collection in the southern hemisphere. The collection includes unique and rare clocks and is located conveniently near good restaurants, too. 5.

Tongariro National Trout Centre (Turangi, Waikato): Discover a center dedicated to trout fishing, featuring a museum, freshwater aquarium, kids' fishing pond, and blue duck conservation center. Taupo is famous for its trout fly fishing, and this is an unusual but interesting part of Turangi. 8. Ohakune Carrot Adventure Park (Ohakune, Manawatu-Whanganui): Playing on New Zealand’s habit of making outsized fruit and vegetables, you can stand next to a giant carrot and explore a vegetable-themed playground in Ohakune, the self-proclaimed carrot capital of the world. 9. Whanganui Journey (Taumarunui to Pipiriki, Manawatu-Whanganui): Experience a canoe journey along the Whanganui River, known as the only river in the world with the status of a living entity. You can’t take a selfie with a river anywhere else in the world - definitely unusual! 10.

He was a shy little bug, but his shyness didn’t stop him from making lots of friends.

Buggy knew that could only mean one thing—he and his friends could get caught! “Oh no!” Buggy yelled out, feeling fearful. Despite being shy, he raised his voice loudly and said, “Everyone, we’ve got to run! There’s a net among us.” Beatrice, Buggy’s bee friend, buzzed out, “I know a place we can all go and hide. Let’s go!” As the bugs all scattered, Buggy found himself flying quite slowly. Before he knew it, he could see the fine holes in the net grow closer and closer like an eagle-eyed predator! Buggy’s worst fears were coming true until he saw a flash of yellow pick him up and carry him away at super speed. It was Beatrice! She had rescued Buggy and taken him to a soft leaf to keep him safe. “Wow, thank you, Beatrice!” Said Buggy. “Don’t mention it, Buggy,” Beatrice blushed, “that’s what friends are for!” Finally, Buggy could breathe easily. He was with all his friends, safe and sound."},{"prompt":"What is the concept of 'Duchenne smiles' and 'non-Duchenne smiles'?","completion":"In the field of psychology, smiles have been classified into two types - Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles, named after Guillaume Duchenne, a 19th-century French neurologist. This distinction has interesting implications in the context of deception and lying. A Duchenne smile is considered a genuine smile. It involves both the zygomatic major muscle, which pulls up the corners of the mouth, and the orbicularis oculi muscle, causing the eyes to 'crinkle' or 'twinkle'. Duchenne smiles are often associated with genuine, spontaneous expressions of positive emotion and are difficult to fake because the orbicularis oculi is not typically under conscious control. In contrast, a non-Duchenne smile, also known as a social or polite smile, involves only the zygomatic major muscle. The eyes do not show the characteristic crinkle. These smiles can be easily fabricated, and are therefore often associated with politeness or masking true feelings, including deception."},{"prompt":"Write a scene about two friends who haven’t seen each other in years crossing paths in a park super far from home.

The face comes into my mind and goes out--the face floats in my mind. The pen has fallen from my fingers. The house is silent. The eyes of the floating face are turned away from me. My wife is a girl who came here to this town from another town in the state of Ohio. We keep a servant but my wife often sweeps the floors and she sometimes makes the bed in which we sleep together. We sit together in the evening but I do not know her. I cannot shake myself out of myself. I wear a brown coat and I cannot come out of my coat. I cannot come out of myself. My wife is very gentle and she speaks softly but she cannot come out of herself. My wife has gone out of the house. She does not know that I know every little thought of her life. I know what she thought when she was a child and walked in the streets of an Ohio town. I have heard the voices of her mind. I have heard the little voices. I heard the voice of fear crying when she was first overtaken with passion and crawled into my arms. Again I heard the voices of fear when her lips said words of courage to me as we sat together on the first evening after we were married and moved into this house. It would be strange if I could sit here, as I am doing now, while my own face floated across the picture made by the yellow house and the window. It would be strange and beautiful if I could meet my wife, come into her presence. The woman whose face floated across my picture just now knows nothing of me. I know nothing of her. She has gone off, along a street. The voices of her mind are talking. I am here in this room, as alone as ever any man God made. It would be strange and beautiful if I could float my face across my picture. If my floating face could come into her presence, if it could come into the presence of any man or any woman--that would be a strange and beautiful thing to have happen.","completion":"Instagram Captions: \\"Lost in thoughts, little things grow big in my mind. #DeepContemplation\\" \\"The window before me, a framed escape into another world. #WindowView\\" \\"In the stillness, I sense something impending. #QuietMoments\\" \\"Trembling hand, uncertain emotions.

It doesn't matter the activity, or the duration, just that you stick to the schedule. Committing consistently to other activities, even reading, walking, or doing chores, will eventually form better habits. * Figure out what a few of your interests are and join a club or group related to them. Video games and other online activities usually have some related local activities if you look. Having hobbies or interests in common is a great way for adults to make friends and start new relationships. * Take some time and reach out to people you haven't talked to in a while, whether it's family or old friends. A call, text, or email can spark up a past relationship that only lacked a bit of effort, and believe it or not, they probably miss you too. * Volunteering is a good way to meet new people and feel productive at the same time. You'll have a chance to do some networking, as well as help your local community. * Going back to school is a great way to renew your motivation and social life. It doesn't have to be full-time, or to get a degree, it can be as little as one hour a week. Education outside of your job can provide much-needed brain stimulation and many opportunities to meet classmates with similar ideas. Do these hit the mark that you were thinking of? Let me know if you would like any changes or other ideas. I hope these help you feel more connected and productive."},{"prompt":"Can you give me a list of popular meme names from the 2000s and what they looked like?","completion":"Here are a few memes from the 2000s: - Badger, Badger, Badger: This meme featured several identical illustrations of a badger dancing to an electronic beat. - LOLCats: These are typically photos of real cats captioned with Impact typeface messages.

Judaism today is descended from Rabbinic Judaism, that is, the Judaism that emerged after the destruction of the second temple by the Romans in 70 ce. This form of Judaism was centered around the Torah and the synagogue, instead of the temple. From the first century ce until the nineteenth century, there was basically only one way of being Jewish, and for the most part, by choice or not, it consisted of a life lived separated from the larger society. With the growing secularization in nineteenth-century Western Europe, however, Jews became more active participants in “secular” society, even while maintaining their “sacred” practices and beliefs. Different interpretations of Judaism developed that guided the interplay between these sacred and secular worlds. Over time, these differences resulted in the four main branches of Judaism that exist today. Orthodox Judaism is the modern term for what historically has been mainline Judaism: in other words, before the nineteenth century, Orthodox Judaism was Judaism, plain and simple. It is based on an understanding of the Torah as the unchangeable, inerrant revelation of God that provides the sole guide for all aspects of one’s daily life. Accordingly, Orthodox Jews meticulously observe Jewish law, that is, halakhah (literally “the way one walks”), which is based on an understanding that all 613 commandments within the Torah have been revealed as the direct, immutable will of God. Reform Judaism emerged during the Enlightenment as some sought to “reform” Jewish thought and practice in light of new scientific developments, political ideas, and modernism. While Orthodox Judaism considers the Torah the unchanging divine command of God, Reform Judaism sees the Torah as written by “divinely inspired” human authors. The Torah—and the commandments therein—is regarded as instructional and inspirational, but not absolutely binding. Reform Judaism emphasizes obligation to the neighbor, care for the world, and the injunction to offer hospitality and care to all in need. All other aspects of Judaism are open to negotiation. Conservative Judaism was founded as a response to what were viewed as overly radical changes in Reform Judaism: it was believed that while change was needed, Reform Judaism had moved too far too quickly. Conservative Judaism emphasizes on ritual practice, rather than specific doctrines. One of the distinguishing marks of Conservative Judaism, as opposed to Reform Judaism, is its preservation of the halakhic process when deciding how traditional interpretation of Jewish law might be changed. In that process, rabbis consult sacred scriptures and commentaries, rabbinic codes of law, and previous generations of rabbinical opinion, in order to craft a new reading for today. Reconstructionist Judaism is the most recent to emerge. It holds that what is important about Judaism is not that everyone believes the same things about divine revelation, miracles, and God, or that people follow Jewish law in the same way. Instead, it sees the value of Judaism first as a cultural force uniting, supporting, and nurturing the Jewish people over time and space. As such, everything is open to debate and modification—all beliefs, all doctrines, all practices—according to the current needs of the Jewish community. Tradition is important as a way of maintaining community, but it has only a voice, not a veto—and, of course, there are many different views about how much of a vote tradition should have in any specific decision about Jewish life.","completion":"Rabbinic Judaism, which emerged after 70 CE, focused on the Torah and the synagogue, instead of the temple.

What are some possible causes?","completion":"Low fantasy settings are known for their more realistic scenarios, where magic and the supernatural are not as widespread or pervasive. As such, here are some possible causes of war in your setting: 1. Territorial claims: Perhaps the recent succession of a ruler or the annulment of a marriage has made the ownership of a desirable territory disputed. Perhaps it is not the desirability of the territory, but rather the political situation that necessitates war. One nation, out of concern for how others may perceive them if they do not enforce their claims, feels obligated to act aggressively. 2. Resources: A magical catalyst essential in the production of vital medicines is available in a key region. Ownership of it would prolong the rule and the perceived stability of the nation's leadership who controls it. 3. Preemptive strike: The rapid economic growth of one nation has stoked fears that they will soon rearm and build a mighty military. The other nation believes they must be stopped before that can come to pass. 4. Buffer state: Out of fears that another, larger empire would consume one of the nations and use them as a staging area for an invasion, one nation feels it is necessary to invade them to set up a buffer state that is friendly to their interests.

So when his owners, Tom and Emily, told him he was going to the Grand Canyon, he was both nervous and excited to embark on his first road trip. The Grand Canyon sounded so... Grand! Would he have insects to eat? Somewhere warm to sleep? When he saw his owners carefully packing his tank and heating lamp into the backseat of their car along with those little packages of yummy insects, he knew everything would be just fine. As they drove through the roads from Colorado to Arizona, Bernie enjoyed a warm patch of sun shining through the car windows. He watched the scenery change from lush forests to barren deserts, with huge red rock formations off in the distance. It was all so fascinating and new. When they finally arrived at The Grand Canyon, Bernie was blown away. Tom and Emily carefully carried his tank to the lookout point, where Bernie could see the view of the canyon. He was in awe of the winding canyon of many colors spread out before him. As the day wore on, Tom and Emily hiked many trails and explored the scenic overlooks while Bernie basked in the sun in his tank, munched on yummy insects, and took in all the sights. The environment was so foreign to him. He was born in captivity and had always lived in tanks. But as the sun began to set, something odd stirred in him. Bernie grew restless. He wanted to explore the canyon himself, to feel the sand and rock beneath his feet. So Tom and Emily pulled out his harness. Bernie was surprised and a little nervous but excited too! They carefully strapped Bernie's harness onto his back and took him for a walk along the canyon's edge! Bernie felt like a true adventurer, a real wild dragon, as he climbed over rocks and explored the hidden crevices of the canyon. He even met a kind and chatty desert-horned lizard! It was incredible! As the sun set over the canyon, Tom and Emily tucked Bernie back into his tank for a good night's sleep and Bernie couldn't help but dream of the adventures that awaited him tomorrow.

She is a smart person who has researched dog training and housebreaking. She sees a puppy at the shelter and decides to adopt it. She names him Weylin. Throughout the next few weeks, she begins training him, but he is a very defiant puppy. He doesn't seem to be a good listener and she can't get control of him. This begins to frustrate Alex. She doesn't think she will ever get a handle on training Weylin. She has been very forceful with her training. She is far too controlling and unable to focus on the task at hand because she is so angry that he won't listen to her. Something tells her that she hasn't done a good enough job bonding with Weylin. She is often busy with other things. She decides she will take more time to exercise Weylin and spend quality time having fun with him. Over time, Alex bonds with Weylin, and the two learn to trust each other. With a newfound respect for the dog, Alex refocuses on training him. She is much less forceful and doesn't let her anger take control of her actions. She is surprised to see that Weylin has a newfound respect for her as well. He begins to learn and listen to her commands. She realizes that she has been too controlling with everyone in her life, rather than focusing on enjoying life and having fun with them. Perhaps if she begins to let go of control and focus on enjoying life, she would not have alienated the people in her life. Alex comes away from this experience with a new point of view on life.

And so, though sizable and centrally located in the Weeping Sea, none of the surrounding kingdoms had ever bothered trying to conquer Chenton. It also didn’t hurt that the island’s only natural harbor was nestled deep in Lamar Bay. Its narrow entrance was hard to navigate without previous experience but easy for even the nation’s irregular militia to defend. The island produced no gold or gemstones. Instead, Chenton society was known for its shipwrights. Chentonian thornwood was no stronger than mainland hardwoods, but the artisans themselves were a step above the rest. Kings and nobles had fawned over Chentonian schooners for centuries, and they paid handsomely to fly their flags on thornwood masts. Indeed, it wasn’t unusual for the flagships of both sides to have the same Chentonian shipwright’s name on their keels."},{"prompt":"Create a brainless multiple-choice quiz that has absolutely no connection to the results in the style of \\"Choose four places to visit and we'll tell you what dessert you should order tonight.\\" There should be 5 questions with 4 responses to each question.

Fifteen years before, she lobbied for a federal anti-lynching bill. But FDR refused to publicly support it because he feared losing southern votes needed for pre-war rearmament. Eleanor continued to push for the bill, drawing criticism to her husband. She recalls him saying, “Well, I can always say I can’t do anything with my wife.” She spotlighted racial discrimination when she resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution in February 1939 for barring world-renowned Black singer Marian Anderson from performing at its Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. “You had an opportunity to lead in an enlightened way and it seems to me…your organization has failed,” Roosevelt wrote to the DAR president. Wiesen Cook, author of a three-volume biography on Roosevelt, said the hypocrisy of having a segregated U.S. military in a war against Nazis—and their brutal racial supremacy—was not lost on the first lady as she walked miles of hospital corridors on the front lines, holding up bottles of plasma for wounded soldiers. “Eleanor Roosevelt was reviled by the Dixiecrats [conservative southern democrats], by the conservatives, by members of Congress and by the press because she stood for justice and she stood for civil rights at a time when, even during World War II, the military is segregated, blood plasma is segregated, it’s segregated black and white,” said Wiesen Cook in a 2013 interview. “Everywhere she goes, she is demanding racial justice.”","completion":"1948: Roosevelt wrote against segregation. 1933: Roosevelt lobbied for an anti-lynching bill. 1939: Roosevelt resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution for their racial discrimination."},{"prompt":"Write a haiku about students waiting for the end of the school day.

Founded in 1776, the library is part of the oldest still-operating monastery in Austria and features a stunning white and gold Baroque style interior. Atop the gilded shelves and columns in the library's grand two-story interior, curved ceilings feature stunning frescoes painted by Bartolomeo Altomonte, an Austrian who was known for painting large-scale frescoes. Today, the library is home to more than 200,000 sacred texts. With its two stories of dark wood arches encompassing a collection of more than 7 million volumes, the Old Library at Trinity College, is not only one of the world's oldest libraries, but one of the most renowned. Located in the center of Dublin, the dark and hallowed halls of the Old Library were constructed in 1712. It's a key attraction for tourists, many of whom purchase advance tickets to view the Book of Kells, an illuminated vellum manuscript of the four gospels that dates back to the fourth century. Every day, a different page of the book is displayed to the public. Unlike the other libraries on our list, this one is practically new. The Tianjin Binhai Library opened to the public in 2017 and was described by Time magazine as a \\"ziggurat,\\" with its white undulating bookshelves surrounding a spherical auditorium. The 363,000 square-foot (33,700 square-meter) building was designed by Dutch firm MVRDV and can hold 1.35 million books.

Use humor, but overall don’t forget to use art terms college students would be able to understand.","completion":"M.C. Escher’s ‘Relativity’ is the gold standard for those who love art, optical illusions, and defying the laws of physics. It can even be the centerpiece of your collection if you adore a good mental workout. Let’s go on to dissect this iconic piece properly. There is, of course, masterful use of perspective––it’s definitely a metaphorical elephant in the room. It’s certainly not unusual to see a three-point perspective, but to see the vanishing points form a triangle is impressive. If you remember from early school days, you’ll know a typical formation of a three-point perspective involves two horizon vanishing points and the third being above or below. As for lines, Escher used cross-hatching to create depth and shading. Even the faceless humanoid figures look eerily real due to the expert lines. The direction of the lines is also important, as they seem to mold the structures within the piece In conclusion, M.C. Escher’s ‘Relativity’ takes us through a parallel dream world in which gravity is only a suggestion and not a law. You could pick out symbolism and references, but a technical artist will argue that perspective and line are the show's stars."},{"prompt":"Tell me about the process of choosing a city for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In 1989, a man got more than he bargained for at a flea market in Adamstown, Pennsylvania when he bought a framed painting for 4. He found a document folded up behind the painting, which experts later identified as a rare first printing of the Declaration of Independence. The document is one of about 200 copies the printer John Dunlap made after the declaration’s ratification on July 4, 1776. The ink was still wet on this copy when it was printed, an auction expert told The New York Times, evidenced by the first line of the Declaration’s text appearing in reverse at the bottom of the page. In 2000, TV producer Norman Lear bought the copy discovered at the flea market for a record 8.14 million through Sotheby’s, a global auction house.","completion":"Norman Lear bought the copy of the Declaration of Independence at an auction in 2000."},{"prompt":"Write a podcast script for an elementary school that includes a school announcement, science facts, and a joke of the day.","completion":"Intro You're listening to the Sunnyvale Elementary School podcast and this is Episode 10. I'm Polly and joining me today are Milford from Ms. Hager's 4th-grade class and Tisha from Mr. Bonner's 5th-grade class. Today our topics include an announcement about school lunches, some interesting facts about space and of course, our daily joke. First, Matthew, please share your important announcement. Segment 1 Thank you, Polly. This is just a reminder that every Tuesday is Don't Wrap It, Bag It Day. Please remember to bring your lunch and snacks in reusable containers or bags. The class with the most Bag It lunches will get free ice cream cups for lunch on Friday. Now, Tisha will give us a few space facts. Segment 2 The 4th graders have been learning about the solar system this week. Here are a few fun facts about the solar system: • It's really hot inside Jupiter! No one knows exactly how hot, but scientists think it could be about 43,000°F (24,000°C) near Jupiter's core. • Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and its gravity is very weak. This means that it would not be able to hold on to its moon for very long. Any moon that Mercury did have would eventually either crash into the planet or be pulled into orbit around the Sun. • Saturn's rings are one of the most iconic features of our solar system. They are made up of billions of tiny particles of ice and rock, ranging in size from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are so thin that they are almost transparent, and they can only be seen from Earth when the sunlight hits them at just the right angle. Segment 3 Here's our joke of the day: Q: What do you call a sleeping bull? A: A bull-dozer! Outro (ending) Thanks for listening to the Sunnyvale Elementary School podcast.

The first is that My Photo Stream, the free cloud-based photo syncing feature Apple launched in 2011, is still up and running in 2023. That’s despite it being effectively superseded by iCloud Photo Library roughly eight years ago. Now that you’re up to date, the second piece of news is that My Photo Stream is shutting down in a couple of months’ time on July 26th, according to an Apple Support page spotted by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The end of My Photo Stream won’t come as too much of a surprise. Although it was free, it came with a long list of restrictions on the amount of photos you could upload, and these were only saved on Apple’s servers for 30 days. Photos saved in the cloud then had to be manually saved locally if you wanted to keep them on a secondary device and, perhaps worst of all, 9to5Mac notes that high-quality photos weren’t synced in their original resolution. iCloud’s free storage may be relatively limited at just 5GB, but at least it acts like a modern cloud storage service with photos and videos stored in their full resolution. Apple’s support page notes that new photo uploads to My Photo Stream will come to an end on June 26th, and that the feature will disappear entirely a month later. “The photos in My Photo Stream are already stored on at least one of your devices,” Apple’s page notes, “So as long as you have the device with your originals, you won’t lose any photos as part of this process.”","completion":"Q: Is My Photo Stream, Apple's cloud-based photo syncing feature, still available in 2023? A: Yes, My Photo Stream is still available in 2023 despite being superseded by iCloud Photo Library. Q: When will My Photo Stream be shutting down? A: My Photo Stream is set to shut down on July 26th. Q: Is the end of My Photo Stream surprising? A: The end of My Photo Stream is not surprising because it had limitations such as restricted photo uploads, photos saved for only 30 days, and a lack of syncing high-quality photos in their original resolution. Q: How does iCloud differ from My Photo Stream? A: iCloud offers modern cloud storage with photos and videos stored in their full resolution, unlike My Photo Stream. Q: When will new photo uploads to My Photo Stream come to an end? A: New photo uploads to My Photo Stream will come to an end on June 26th. Q: Will users lose any photos when My Photo Stream shuts down? A: “The photos in My Photo Stream are already stored on at least one of your devices,” Apple’s page notes, “So as long as you have the device with your originals, you won’t lose any photos as part of this process.”"},{"prompt":"Write an instructional-style article on how to make smores at home. Make it nostalgic and descriptive. Use a numbered list to give various options for making them.","completion":"S'mores are a delicious treat most often enjoyed over a summer campfire. Who doesn't remember a cool, summer evening out with friends and family enjoying a little bit of crispy, chocolatey goodness? In this article, we will explore three simple ways to bring that s'mores experience inside your home. 1. Microwaving S'mores: The microwave is the simplest and most often used method for making a homemade s'more. It is a simple process. All you need to do is put a graham cracker down on a microwave-safe plate or napkin, then top it with a piece of chocolate, and then the marshmallow. You are going to want to watch it closely depending on the power of your machine so try to do it in 15-second intervals. As soon as you see the chocolate starting to glisten and the marshmallow itself change shape it is time to take it out and use the other graham cracker to smush it down. Then it is ready to eat. 2. Air Frying S'mores: Air fryers are the new wonder machine of the modern kitchen. They can impart a toasty flavor to the graham cracker giving it a hint of campfire goodness. When you close your eyes, you can hardly tell the difference. To make a s'more in an air fryer you first put both graham crackers in the bottom of the basket. Top one of the graham crackers with a marshmallow and set your device to around 400 degrees Fahrenheit. It should take about 5 minutes for the marshmallow to brown and heat up. When it does, pull out the basket, put a chocolate bar piece on top of the marshmallow, and then complete the sandwich using the other toasted graham cracker half. Enjoy immediately. 3. Oven S'mores: Making s'mores in an oven is nearly the same as in an air fryer. Place graham cracker halves on a baking sheet, place a piece of chocolate on one and marshmallow on the other, set the oven to 400 degrees, place the sheet on top rack for a few minutes then pull it out. From here, you can put the two halves together, and now you have a delicious s'more to enjoy at any day or time. S'mores aren't just for summer; bite into one all year round!"},{"prompt":"Write an email from a travel agency informing a customer of an alteration to the customer's flight plans.","completion":"Hello Johnathon, We hope this message finds you well.

In 1977, in the space of two days, three teenagers, all of whom were separate at the time of the sightings, swear they saw a creature with “large eyes that glowed and tendril fingers.” When authorities plotted the sightings on a map, the path was a straight line for two miles, but the creature was never found. That’s the only time the creature was ever spotted in Dover, Massachusetts, but those three sightings sparked legends for decades. 2. Yowie – also known as Sasquatch, Skunk Ape, Bigfoot, and Yeti (depending on where you go to hear about sightings). This large, hairy, humanoid creature has many names, and many cryptozoologists believe that there are hundreds of these creatures across the world because of the numerous locations of supposed sightings. Grainy photographs have captured massive footprints and what could be eyes in the wilderness, while other pictures show human-like figures, covered in hair, from very far away. The first-ever reported sighting of Bigfoot was in 1811 in Alberta, Canada, but Native Americans have talked of similar creatures in their stories and folklore for centuries. 3. The Jersey Devil. The folklore of The Jersey Devil spawns from a story about Mother Leeds, a New Jersey woman with twelve children. She discovered that she was pregnant with her thirteenth child and, in a fit of rage, cursed her pregnancy, offering the child to whoever listened. When the baby was born, it sprouted the features of a goat, horse, and bat all at once, then flew off into the trees. Some of The Jersey Devil's legend has been proven as fact. There was a Mother Leeds, and she left a written will to 12 children, but there’s never been documented evidence of the thirteenth child. There have been over 1,000 sightings of The Jersey Devil up until 2016, and the cryptid is often blamed for any bad luck that New Jersey farmers have with livestock and crops. 4. Champ (or Champy) Sea serpents have been the subject of cryptozoological sightings for centuries, but Champ is one of the most famous in Vermont, New York, and parts of Canada where Lake Champlain extends for 125 miles. There have been 300 sightings since 1609, but the most notable was a report in 1970 that described the creature as “a twenty-foot-long serpent, thick as a barrel, with a head like a horse.”"},{"prompt":"Please cut down this text to three sentences only, keeping only the important details.

Peas are high in protein, but it is hard to mask their taste when they are used as a meat substitute in large amounts in vegan dishes. Scientists discovered a gene for pea flavour 30 years ago. The research was stopped as there was no use for it. Now it could be the basis of a new industry. \\"The world has changed.

Don’t bog it down with science and facts, but do talk about how dangerous pesticide food is within industrial farming. Less than 300 words.","completion":"Millions of Americans have restricted or completely cut out gluten from their diets. While some skip gluten because of a chosen diet, most people do so because their bodies have rejected gluten. But a Harvard study has recently released new and incredibly interesting information which states that millions of people who think they are allergic or intolerant to gluten actually have no problem with gluten at all! We’re here to tell you that if you believe your body cannot properly digest gluten, or even if your doctor diagnosed you with an allergy, it is extremely likely that you have no problem with glutenous food that contains wheat. In fact, you’re likely not allergic to wheat at all. The Harvard study found that it is actually the pesticides used on wheat that are causing millions of people to struggle with gluten digestion. That means that if you grew wheat in your yard without any pesticides, you would probably be able to eat anything you made with it without any issues at all! Now, it’s important to note that this is not the case for 100% of those Americans with gluten allergies. A select few may actually be intolerant to gluten itself; however, for millions of Americans, this could change everything. But in order for the masses to be able to enjoy glutenous products again, something needs to change in the way we allow industrial farmers to treat and grow wheat. Exactly how that will happen is still unclear. But there has certainly been a lot of talk since the study was released about exactly what these big farms are putting on our food and how it’s affecting not only what we eat but also how we feel."},{"prompt":"What should I make for dinner tonight?","completion":"There are a lot of options, can you tell me what you do or don't like to eat or if you have any allergies or food aversions?"},{"prompt":"I'm lactose intolerant and I don't like broccoli or pork.","completion":"That is helpful, thank you!

Students poured out of the school for the final time that day, with the teachers seeing them off as they went home. That day, Kofune walked with two of his friends. It was an ordinary day like any other. They talked about whether they would get the new game that had come out recently. As they talked, their everyday surroundings blended into the same indiscernible backdrop. As their attention shifted inward, calamity struck. A truck ran the red light at an intersection that had always been perfectly safe. Kofune was the first to see it. His body reacted before anyone else's, and he shoved his two friends out of the way of danger. He wasn't so fortunate, and the impact brought him within inches of death's door. As he lay there, the world fading, he wished he could have continued to live out his life. He regretted not being able to do the things he'd always dreamed of. Kofune woke with a start in a forest. He checked his body, but there were no injuries. He also had no idea where he was and searched his memory for clues. He remembered being struck by a truck, then he heard the voices of his friends followed by sirens. Then there was a voice of a woman who asked him what his deepest desire was. He remembered answering that he wanted the strength to live out his dreams. His wish was granted, and the next thing Kofune knew, he was waking in the forest. He looked around, but nothing was familiar. He didn't recognize the types of trees or any of the plants.

He tried as best he could to evaluate the situation in front of him with objective scrutiny; he was told by many people to \\"get rid of the dogs, they cost you too much money\\" and \\"get a job.\\" Those people were right, but Melvin's emotions and other factors played into his decision to stay at home and be a father to his four children. But on one fateful day, he decided to answer an online advertisement for writers for a new company. He knew his capabilities; he was a good typist and a decent writer. Driven by the fear of having to live another day without enough money for food for his family, Melvin applied for the job, and after being hired by the company and working there for several months, he had enough money to pay for food at the grocery store. While at the store, something caught his eye: the national 50 million lottery. Melvin decided to take a small chance and put down the 10 for the ticket, with the slimmest and most remote of hopes that he would hit it big. That hope became extraordinary joy and disbelief when his ticket was the winning ticket for the 50 million, and now he was a multimillionaire virtually overnight. However, his joy and happiness were soon replaced by feelings of emptiness and sorrow as the people around him, those he considered friends, began asking for more and more money and left when the money ran out. Melvin had spent the entire 50 million within the short span of a year, buying a house, throwing lavish parties, and blowing through the rest with reckless abandon. Melvin bought seemingly useless or meaningless items, such as a dinosaur's skull, a comic book collection, diamond-studded jewelry for his sons, and diamond-studded collars for his dogs.

I love public and historic sites and parks, as well as any buildings that are just cool to look at.","completion":"- Point State Park: Point state park is one of the best in the city. It’s located where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio River. The area played a big role in the French and Indian War in the mid-1700s, and it houses the Fort Pitt Museum and Fort Pitt Block House, as well as the Three Rivers Heritage Trail. There are tons of plaques, monuments, and markers that detail the park’s history. It’s also a great place to watch the sunset. - The Cathedral of Learning: The Cathedral is one of the most stunning landmarks in Pittsburgh. The Cathedral of Learning is a 42-story skyscraper and is home to many classrooms, libraries, a theater, and many other things. When it was built, it was the tallest building in the city, and it is still the second-tallest educational building in the world. - Old Allegheny County Jail: This prison was open for a hundred years between the late 1800s and late 1900s. A bridge called the Bridge of Sighs connects it to the courthouse. It’s now a museum, and you are able to do self-guided tours. - Fort Pitt Museum: The Fort Pitt Museum tells of the history of the role western Pennsylvania played during events in US history like the French and Indian War and the American Revolution.

Instead of administering and policing Germany side by side, as the Allies did in postwar Austria, the decision was made at Potsdam to divide Germany into four distinct occupation zones, one for each Allied nation (including France).

Since the Soviet army already occupied much of eastern Germany, the Soviet Union was put in charge of the northeast quadrant, which included the capital Berlin. Berlin itself was also subdivided into four quadrants, with the British, French, Soviets and Americans each policing a different zone of the capital, which was fully surrounded by Soviet-occupied territory.","completion":"After World War II, the Allied Powers decided to split Germany into four zones, one controlled by each member of the Allied Powers and one by the Soviet Union.

I'll write that.","completion":"All homeowners will have to do their share of cleaning out clogged drains and painting rooms. Often, home repairs are as simple as painting the front door or replacing the bathroom floor. Though these types of repairs can certainly work up a sweat and take up your whole weekend, they are usually pretty straightforward and don’t take a rocket scientist to complete. Occasionally though, you may be faced with repairs that are way beyond your scope of expertise. These days you can find a YouTube video that describes how to complete just about any repair imaginable. There are some areas, however, where you may find it much more beneficial (and safer) to hire a pro. All electrical work should be completed by a licensed electrician. That mindset goes for plumbing as well, except for the occasional leaky faucet or clogged drain. Rewiring or re-plumbing a whole house is not only a huge undertaking, but most cities require that this scope of work be completed by a licensed pro in accordance with city codes and permits. That way, your city can set a certain standard for the whole community so that your family can feel safe knowing that all the houses on the block had to pass inspection on their electrical wiring, plumbing, and building specifications. Do some research to find several reputable companies. It’s pretty easy to find out if an electrician, plumber, or builder has gotten bad feedback from past customers to determine if they're worth your time."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this article as if it were a news script for a news station called USN. Special counsel Jack Smith's office has obtained a recording of former President Donald Trump discussing a classified planning document that he had taken from his time at the White House, a source directly familiar with the matter told NBC News. The planning document Trump kept was related to Iran, the source said, and the former president acknowledged on the tape that it was classified. The recording was made in July 2021 during a meeting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, that included people who were helping former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows write his memoir, the source said. The tape was played during testimony provided to the grand jury that has been investigating Trump's handling of classified documents, the source added. The evidence appears to undercut Trump’s claim that he declassified all the government documents that came into his possession after he left the White House, and it would be important in any effort by prosecutors to prove that Trump knew he possessed classified information. News that federal officials had obtained the audio recording was first reported by CNN. NBC News has not heard the recording. The special counsel's investigation into Trump, which focuses on his alleged mishandling of more than 100 classified documents that were discovered at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last year, appears to be approaching an end. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, rebuffing allegations that he mishandled classified documents. He claimed last year that he can declassify documents “by thinking about it.” FBI agents said in a redacted affidavit last year that they found 184 unique documents that had classification markings in the 15 boxes that Trump returned to the National Archives in January. The affidavit stated that 25 documents were marked as “TOP SECRET,” 67 documents marked as “confidential” and 92 marked “secret.” That then led to the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago by FBI agents who recovered a trove of top secret and other highly classified documents, court documents unsealed by a federal judge said.","completion":"(Breaking News Intro Music Plays) (Fade from Black) (Camera 1 - Close up on Susan) Susan - \\"Hello, and welcome to USN News.

It should include the symptoms and signs of a bad filling, while also urging the importance of early treatment.","completion":"Dental fillings are usually made from composite resin, metallic amalgam, or a special type of gold alloy. Though some are made from special dental grade porcelain that initially looks just like real tooth enamel. They are cemented to the surrounding tooth enamel to treat a small area of tooth decay or a physical defect like a chipped tooth. While they are meant to last a long time, all dental fillings have a finite lifespan. If you struggle to maintain a good oral hygiene regimen, the demineralization effect on your tooth enamel can gradually weaken the seam between the natural tooth enamel and the dental filling material. As this continues to progress bacteria could gain increasing access to the area. As the bacteria starts to affect more and more of the tooth, you might notice discomfort or newly developed sensitivity. In some cases, you might also notice a change in surface texture or color. Without professional treatment from a dentist, the tooth could suffer from worsening complications. If you’re lucky and it’s just a small dental filling that’s just started to fail, the dentist might be able to simply replace it with a new dental filling. This usually involves removing a small amount of the surrounding tooth enamel before applying a slightly larger dental filling. If the bad dental filling is large or a new area of tooth decay has developed in the adjacent tooth enamel your dentist might recommend treating the tooth with a dental crown restoration. This will call for completely replacing the entire tooth enamel layer. Though one thing's for sure. The longer you wait to get a suspected bad filling treated, the more likely it is to fail. The more time that goes by without a dentist's attention the more likely tooth decay is to develop under the bad dental filling. In some cases, it could even allow bacteria to invade the root of the tooth causing a toothache, which might require a root canal."},{"prompt":"Home automation is all the hype these days and I am wondering if it’s a good investment.

The characters should all be anthropomorphized hamsters who wear clothes and hats. The scene takes place in a private lounge, since these are wealthy hamsters with servants.","completion":"ACT 1 Scene 1 Evening - opulent lounge in the city. Three obese hamsters wearing clothes and hats are sitting in a private lounge. Servants scurry through the room taking orders and attending to the guests. Low light comes from a hanging chandelier whose crystals twinkle softly as a backdrop to the hamsters' conversation. ALOICOUS It's rather hot in here, don't you think, Stevens? STEVENS Quite. Perhaps ask one of the servants to turn down the heat. PERNELLA I can't imagine what you mean. It's not hot in here at all, you two. Let the servants alone for once. (Aloicous signals a servant, who scurries over.) ALOICOUS It's sweltering in here. Could you please edge the thermostat down a touch? That's a good man.

Can you provide some different methods I could try?","completion":"Potty training your dog to go outside can be hard. Here are some helpful tips for you to try. 1. Outdoor Confinement: Create a small area of confinement outdoors. When your dog wakes in the morning, take them to this area of confinement and stand back. If your dog goes to the bathroom within the first ten minutes praise them. However, if they do not bring the dog back inside, keep them on a short leash under your watch. If the dog tries to go to the bathroom inside, interrupt them and take them back to the area of confinement. Slowly ween your dog out of the area of confinement once they are fully using this area within 10 minutes. 2. Bells: Hang bells on your door knob. Each time you go outside use your dog's paw to tap the bells. The idea behind this is that when the dog needs to go to the bathroom, it will tap the bells, alerting you to the fact they need to go outside. 3. Be Alert: Be alert to your dog's elimination patterns. Do they need to go to the bathroom after eating, sleeping, or playing? If there is a pattern, you can easily take your dog outside after these activities. This also includes signs your dog is exhibiting when needing to go outside to potty, such as: • Spinning in circles. • Going to areas where they have previously had accidents. • Hiding in another room, around corners, behind furniture. • Scratching or barking at the door. 4. Timer: Set a timer! Sometimes we can lose track of time if the dog is not showing signs when they need to go outside. Remember to practice patience and not give up. Your dog will start going outside to potty before you know it."},{"prompt":"What is the moral of this story? This is the story: In ancient Greek, there was a king named Midas. He had a lot of gold and everything he needed. He also had a beautiful daughter. Midas loved his gold very much, but he loved his daughter more than his riches. One day, a satyri named Silenus got drunk and passed out in Midas’ rose garden. Believing that Satyrs always bring good luck, Midas lets Silenus rest in his palace until he is sober, against the wishes of his wife and daughter. Silenus is a friend of Dionysus, the god of wine and celebration. Upon learning Midas’ kindness towards his friend, Dionysus decides to reward the keg. When asked to wish for something, Midas says “I wish everything I touch turns to gold”. Although Dionysus knew it was not a great idea, he granted Midas his wish. Happy that his wish was granted, Midas went around touching random things in the garden and his palace and turned them all into gold. He touched an apple, and it turned into a shiny gold apple. His subjects were astonished but happy to see so much gold in the palace. In his happiness, Midas went and hugged his daughter, and before he realized, he turned her into a lifeless, golden statue! Aghast, Midas ran back to the garden and called for Dionysus. He begged the god to take away his power and save his daughter. Dionysus gives Midas a solution to change everything back to how it was before the wish. Midas learned his lesson and lived the rest of his life content with what he had. Choices for the moral of the story: 1. Hug your daughter tightly, as she might turn into gold tomorrow. 2. Don't be greedy and feel content with what you have. 3. It is good to drink a lot and pass out. 4. There is no downside to being able to turn everything into gold.","completion":"2.

Here is the source I used. https://www.kudos.com/blog/8-habits-of-great-bosses 2. Great Bosses Listen to Their Employees Great bosses don't just communicate clearly, they actively listen to their employees and seek their input. Then, they act on the input received as quickly as possible. By listening to your workforce and implementing their suggestions, you'll show your team that you value them and their opinions. When employees feel valued, they generally work harder and more productively and are more engaged in their jobs. It's important to remember that hearing and listening are two different things. Listening requires you to concentrate on what your employees say, rather than simply letting their voices wash over your eardrums without effect. If, after listening to your team you decide to go in a different direction, make sure to explain to your team why you made that choice. That way they always feel respected.","completion":"The second habit of a great boss is actively listening to their employees.

Sasha stepped nervously onto the ship ramp with the wind threatening to whip her golden hair from its braid. She’d always known her duty as firstborn would be to serve the Kardille. They had changed her world forever when they showed up with their demands for help, and the treaties assured that every firstborn from the native families would serve in their war against a species even more alien that also wanted to steal the planet. Sasha gripped the railing with a delicate amber colored hand and stepped forward. 2. Jennifer frowned as she surveyed the dishwater gray monstrosity of a building in front of her. The height of the doors was intimidating; they were designed for the tall Kardillean forms to fit through. At least she wouldn’t bump her head on any of the frames here. Jennifer was taller than most people she knew, something that had always embarrassed her, but maybe that was a good thing now that she had been called to duty as firstborn. She could never blend in with the aliens that had taken over the world and demanded the firstborn of every family in servitude against its endless war with another species that wanted to steal her planet. She did have pale, milky skin, though, closer to theirs than most of her people with their golden tans. 3. Bree really didn’t understand the point of making a firstborn walk over three miles on foot to the Kardille intake center. It was bad enough that every family had to give up their oldest kid to the aliens who had taken over their world. Why not make it just a little easier to be ripped away from everyone she loved? She pushed black hair out of her eyes and sighed as she surveyed the road. She was strong and muscular so the exercise wouldn’t kill her. The road was pretty smooth at least.

Where did she die? Jean Racine, in full Jean-Baptiste Racine, (baptized December 22, 1639, La Ferté-Milon, France—died April 21, 1699, Paris), French dramatic poet and historiographer renowned for his mastery of French classical tragedy. His reputation rests on the plays he wrote between 1664 and 1691, notably Andromaque (first performed 1667, published 1668), Britannicus (first performed 1669, published 1670), Bérénice (first performed 1670, published 1671), Bajazet (first performed and published 1672), Phèdre (first performed and published 1677), and Athalie (first performed and published 1691). Racine was born into a provincial family of minor administrators who were financially comfortable and socially ambitious. His mother died 13 months after he was born, and his father died two years later. His maternal grandparents took him in, and, when his grandmother, Marie des Moulins, became a widow, she brought Racine with her, perhaps as early as 1646, to live at the convent of Port-Royal des Champs near Paris. Since a group of devout scholars and teachers had founded a school there, Racine had the opportunity to study the classics of Latin and Greek literature with distinguished masters. The school was steeped in the austere Roman Catholic reform movement that came to be known as Jansenism, which had recently been condemned by the church as heretical. The Jansenists participated in the centuries-long debate over the primacy of free will or of divine omnipotence in the process of salvation. Inspired by the writings of Saint Augustine, as transmitted by Cornelius Otto Jansen, bishop of Ypres, in his work Augustinus (1640), the Jansenists believed that salvation was a gift—a grace—that was accorded only by God and that free will played little role in the process. For these Augustinians, life on earth was to be a rigorous pursuit of penance for original sin. Since the French monarchy suspected the Jansenists of being not only theologically but also politically subversive, Racine’s lifelong relationship with his former friends and teachers remained ambivalent, inasmuch as the artist ever sought admittance into the secular realm of court society. His former teachers remained extremely disappointed in a man who had used his excellent education as a means of succeeding in a profession that Port-Royal considered an abomination, because the theatre promoted illusion as a distraction from reflection on the wretched human condition. The degree to which his upbringing at Port-Royal inspired Racine’s tragic vision is a question unlikely to be answered with any precision, given the other influences exerted on him, such as those of Greek and Roman tragedy, the Bible, and life itself. After leaving Port-Royal in 1653, Racine transferred to the College of Beauvais for almost two years and then returned to Port-Royal in October 1655 to complete his studies in rhetoric. The school at Port-Royal was closed by the authorities in 1656, but Racine was allowed to stay on there. When he was 18, the Jansenists sent him to study law at the College of Harcourt in Paris. Racine had both the disposition and the talent to thrive in the cultural climate of Paris, where to conform and to please—in Racine’s case, to please by his pen—were indispensable assets. One of the first manifestations of Racine’s intentions was his composition of a sonnet in praise of Jules Cardinal Mazarin, the prime minister of France, for successfully concluding a peace treaty with Spain (1659). This tribute reveals Racine’s strategy of social conquest through what was to become a vocation and a mission: to be acknowledged as the greatest literary figure of his age, in effect the Euripides of classical France.","completion":"Jean Racine was baptized on December 22, 1639.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.” “They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.” “Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking. Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice. One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. “Herald, read the accusation!” said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:— “The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!” “Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury. “Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great deal to come before that!” “Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!” The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.” “You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?” The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I think it was,” he said. “Fifteenth,” said the March Hare. “Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse. “Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. “Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter. “It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter. “Stolen!” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. “I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none of my own. I’m a hatter.” Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. “Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.” This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.","completion":"The Hatter was the first witness.

A local farmer boy from a humble town in Kansas. A city slicker with something to prove from Manhattan. Both attended Oxen University in 1872 and shared their collective visions for the best donut restaurant experience in the world. What started as a shared vision between the two resulted in separation and rivalry for generations to come. Duncan P. Anderson was the founder of the popular retail donut chain, Duncan's Donuts, established in 1875. Fritz Everett was the founder of the premium donut phenomenon rival, Crispy Screams, established one year later in 1876. • Both companies are worth a whopping 220 billion each today. Their missions are both similar and simple: to create the best donut experience for the American consumer. But in their execution, they are worlds apart. • Duncan's Donuts has shifted its approach to its target market and business strategy over time. What started as a cost-effective donut factory grew into a sleek, modern fast casual donut experience that mostly caters to adults. The theme is dark and neon. They have a happy hour from 9pm to 2am. The chain is unique for its offerings of beverages and donuts together. One of its most successful products, the 'lit' donut, was created in 2008. It infuses the bitter, aromatic compounds of fermented malts, with the sweet, syrupy cake of a donut. • Crispy Screams started from day one as a family experience. Each location is both a factory and a shop, allowing consumers to watch the donuts be made fresh daily. They offer one free hot donut off the conveyer belt to every family that walks in. Crispy Screams exists as a philanthropic business that donates 50% of its after-tax earnings to local families and communities. Its mission is to raise money to unite families, especially in hardships such as abuse, separation, or disability.

We all know how tempting it can be to write off ex-lovers, nightmare bosses, former friends, and difficult family members by giving them an armchair diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder—but the reality of NPD is a bit more complex and nuanced than many people realize. 2. When you’ve got a difficult narcissist in your life, it can be all too easy to presume that their problematic behavior stems from an overabundance of self-love, when in fact the opposite is true; despite their bravado, people suffering from narcissistic personality disorder are actually deeply insecure. 3. It’s ironic that the myth of Narcissus—the tale that forms most people’s understanding of Narcissistic Personality Disorder—portrays the young man staring ceaselessly at his mirror image because, in real life, NPD could be explained as an inability to reflect or look inward. 4. If you have a difficult narcissistic personality in your life—or several—you may be put off by the suggestion that you see a professional therapist for your struggles since you’re not the one with a problem; but seeing as people with NPD are extremely unlikely to seek professional help or change themselves, this may actually be your best option. 5.

In a multiplayer horror game, players can play as either survivors or killers. Each online lobby includes 4 survivors and one killer.

As survivors repair generators, the killer can circle around the map hunting down survivors. As a survivor, a heartbeat noise can be heard as the killer enters a nearby radius, giving the survivor a chance to hide or set up a chase with the killer. The killer has a number of abilities that enable them to better hunt down survivors before trying to get them on a sacrificial hook. One of the coolest features of Dead By Daylight is the incorporation of notable characters from popular horror franchises such as Resident Evil, Scream, and many more. Both survivors and killers can level up their characters to unlock unique perks to help improve their gameplay.

It lent an otherworldly ambiance to the surroundings. He strove to recollect the events that had led him to this place. But his mind was completely blank. He could not even recall his name. A growing sense of dread clutched at his heart. He began to feel trapped in this cryptic space. He wanted to escape, so he began to move towards the door.

A rusty serrated blade glinted in its grip. A sense of foreboding descended upon him. He became aware that the figure was silently watching him. He attempted to call out. But his voice was muffled.

His mind was unable to process the gravity of the situation. With a sudden burst of speed, the figure launched itself toward him. The blade glinted in the candlelight. A cacophony of screams rent the air. He was plunged into the depths of the unknown. His heart was gripped by an inexplicable fear. After waking up, he found himself back in his bed, gasping for breath. Was it all a nightmare? Or had he stumbled into an unearthly realm where nightmares were reality? As he surveyed his room, he noticed a rusty, serrated blade lying on his bedside table. An ominous warning of what lurked beyond the realm of his understanding."},{"prompt":"Give a tl;dr for the following Reddit post - Questions for Parents ...

Not in any sense of the word. But that was about to change this Saturday afternoon as she stared down the barrel of a bushel of bananas. The bananas had been sitting on her counter for over a week at this point, turning shades of green, then to yellow, and finally growing brown spots and looking a little limp. The perfect bananas to bake bread with. She had always aspired to be a baker but never had the time with her demanding career. But today was the day that would change. Tina shut off her phone and directed her attention solely to what was in front of her. Flour, sugar, eggs, bananas of course, and all the fixings for a proper banana bread. She was feeling very much connected to her country roots just looking down at the bounty. Her mom was always the master baker in the family, and Tina was sorely hoping that skill did not completely skip a generation. Consulting her recipe, Tina mashed up the bananas as best as she could. Some were quite soft, and others a bit hard, but none held up to the pressure beneath her mighty fork. She furrowed a brow, cracked an egg, and then tossed it into the bowl along with the whole butter stick and an egg. The recipe called for sugar but she only had the brown kind on hand. Oh well, that'd have to do. Into the bowl that went. Then the salt but lacking any measuring device she eyeballed it with her fingertips. Another dash of this and that, and she was done. The concoction looked almost right, a bit gloopy but not runny. But Tina wanted to make it better. In the pantry, she found chocolate morsels, some cashews, and even some shredded coconut. Into the mix, she tossed it all making sure to stir the batter a bit to incorporate the new flavors before spooning it into a loaf pan and then into the oven. An hour later, she heard the oven beep and opened the door to see her creation. Hit with the sweetest of smells; her eyes were less happy. The top was dark brown and the edges were nearly black. But more than that, it was sunken in like a volcano. Sighing under her breath she muttered, \\"Drat.\\""},{"prompt":"I want a scene where a woman is leading an unfulfilled, businesswoman's life where her boss is extremely demanding.

On February 19, 1942—two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor—President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the forced imprisonment, or internment, of Japanese Americans. This was upsetting news to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who, less than two weeks after the Pearl Harbor bombing, had urged non-Japanse Americans not to turn against Japanese Americans in her syndicated column, “My Day.” “We, as citizens, if we hear anything suspicious, will report it to the proper authorities,” she wrote in her December 16 column, acknowledging that the United States was at war with Japan, Germany and Italy. “But the great mass of our people, stemming from these various national ties, must not feel that they have suddenly ceased to be Americans.” As first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt could not and did not want to publicly disagree with her husband’s executive order. (Despite their disagreements, she was a fierce protector of FDR’s image and legacy.) Instead, she attempted to assist Japanese Americans who were in the camps, while publicly praising their loyalty and work ethic in order to convince other Americans that they were not a threat. By the fall of 1941, Eleanor Roosevelt knew that U.S.the United States entry into World War II was a possibility. And she worried about what that would mean for Japanese Americans. At the time, the United States still barred first-generation Japanese immigrants, known as Issei, from becoming citizens under the 1790 Naturalization Act. Second-generation Japanese Americans, known as Nisei, held U.S. citizenship because they were born in the United States. But this did not protect them from racism and discrimination. The first lady reached out to the Justice Department about what might happen to Japanese Americans in the event of war, writes Greg Robinson, a history professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal, in By Order of the President: FDR and the Internment of Japanese Americans. On December 4, 1941—three days before the Pearl Harbor attack—the first lady publicly stated that if the country entered the war, the government would not discriminate against any law-abiding noncitizens living in the United States. That proved very quickly to be untrue. After the U.S. declared war on Japan on December 8, the Treasury Department froze all assets of Issei residents. Eleanor intervened to convince the Treasury Department to relax the restrictions so that families could withdraw 100 a month. Over the next few months, prominent white Americans in the government and media began calling for something even more drastic: the “mass evacuation” of citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent. The first lady was not immune to the anti-Japanese misinformation circulating among white Americans at the time. By January 1942, she believed incorrectly that the government had revealed some Japanese Americans to be spies. (In reality, the government never identified any ethnically Japanese spies living in the United States during the war.) Even so, she opposed the idea of mass evacuation. One of her allies within FDR’s administration was Attorney General Francis Biddle, who tried to advise the president against mass evacuation. But when it became clear that FDR was going to issue an executive order authorizing the forced removal and internment of Japanese Americans, Biddle declined to have the Justice Department intervene. Under Executive Order 9066, the United States forced more than 100,000 Japanese Americans out of their homes and into remote military internment camps. Each camp was surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers. When internees protested the unsafe conditions and inadequate food rations, military police often responded with violence. Publicly, Eleanor did not criticize this internment. Privately, she began corresponding with Japanese Americans in the camps. And she began advocating for a program to transfer Nisei students out of the camps so they could go to college. Her efforts led to the formation of the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council in May 1942. That year, she also asked the Department of War if she could visit one of the camps. They denied her request. When she asked again if she could visit a camp in early 1943, government officials were more amenable. By then, the Army had “opened up enlistment to Japanese American male volunteers, and Franklin Roosevelt endorsed their loyalty,” says Robinson in an interview with HISTORY.com. “He gave a public statement saying Americanism is a matter of the mind and the heart, and not of ancestry.” In April 1943—not long after Eleanor learned that the U.S. hadn’t actually discovered any Japanese Americans spies, as she had previously believed—the first lady made an approved public visit to the Gila River Relocation Center in Pinal County, Arizona. In her “My Day” column about the visit, she praised the internees as hard-working, law-abiding and loyal to the United States. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times published that month, she said that “the sooner we get the young Japanese out of the camps, the better.”","completion":"Question 1: What was the name of the column by former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt? Answer 1: My Day Question 2: Did Japanese Americans hold citizenship during the time period around WW2? Answer 2: Some did and some did not. First-generation Japanese, Issei, were barred from obtaining citizenship under the 1790 Naturalization Act. Second-generation Japanese, Nisei, were allowed citizenship due to being born in the United States. Question 3: Was it before or after the attack on Pearl Harbor when the first lady publicly stated that if the country entered the war, the government would not discriminate against any law-abiding non-citizens living in the United States? Answer 3: The First Lady publicly stated this on December 4, 1941—three days before the Pearl Harbor attack Question 4: After the U.S. declared war on Japan on December 8, the Treasury Department froze all assets of Issei (first-generation Japanese American) residents. True or false? Answer 4: True Question 5: Was Attorney General Francis Biddle for or against the mass evacuation of Japanese Americans during the war? Answer 5: Biddle was of Mrs. Roosevelt's allies within FDR’s administration. He tried to advise the president against mass evacuation. But when it became clear that FDR was going to issue an executive order authorizing the forced removal and internment of Japanese Americans, Biddle declined to have the Justice Department intervene. Question 6: What led to the United States forcing more than 100,000 Japanese Americans out of their homes and into remote military internment camps? Answer 6: Two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor—President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the forced imprisonment, or internment, of Japanese Americans. Question 7: Did First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly oppose her husband's actions against Japanese Americans? Answer 7: As first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt could not and did not want to publicly disagree with her husband’s executive order. (Despite their disagreements, she was a fierce protector of FDR’s image and legacy.) Instead, she attempted to assist Japanese Americans who were in the camps, while publicly praising their loyalty and work ethic in order to convince other Americans that they were not a threat. Question 8: Why did the First Lady help develop the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council in May 1942? Answer 8: This was the product of her advocating for a program to transfer Nisei students out of the camps so they could go to college. Question 9: Did the government allow the First Lady to visit the internment camps? Answer 9: She asked the Department of War in 1942 if she could visit one of the camps. They denied her request.

Lying in front of the BMW was a man in a white lab coat, streaked with blood. He looked to be about her age, but it was hard to tell given his condition. His skin was bruised in multiple places, both eyes were swollen shut, and he had marks around his neck. “Hello, can you hear me?” she asked. No answer. Her imagination was running wild, but she knew she couldn’t have done this. The man had been badly beaten. Hesitantly, Kat put two fingers against the man’s neck. “Please be alive. Please be alive. Please be alive.” There was a pulse, Thank God. Kat went back to the car, got her cell phone, and called 911. They asked her a few questions, and she went to her trunk to get a blanket to cover him until the paramedics arrived. She felt a sense of relief as they pulled up. They asked her some more questions as they began to assess the injuries, checking the man’s pulse (weak) and blood pressure (low). Kat explained to the paramedics that she didn't know the man and proceeded to explain how she had found him. \\"I knew I hadn't hit anything,\\" said Kate \\"but I saw something in front of my windshield when I looked up. I thought I had hit a dog.\\" Then Kate started crying.

She was five years old. She liked to play in her backyard and throw balls for her dog to fetch. She had a swingset and loved swinging and going down the slide as fast as she could. One day she was climbing on a tree and saw a big toad. She liked green frogs and green lizards, but this toad was big, brown, and ugly. He hopped right over to her like he was friendly, but she didn’t want to pick him up. He was too ugly! The next day she slid down her slide too fast and flew off the end, hitting the ground hard with her bottom. She started to cry. Then she looked down and there was the ugly, brown toad again. He hopped onto her lap, and one of her tears fell down and plopped right on his head. Suddenly, pink sparkly smoke was everywhere! When it blew away, a beautiful unicorn was standing by her side. Marissa couldn’t believe her eyes -- a real unicorn was in her backyard! It was white and had a rainbow-colored horn on its head. Its mane was white and thick. The unicorn bent down, and Marissa climbed on its back. Marissa didn’t hurt anymore! The unicorn had wings and flew Marissa around the yard. Then the unicorn talked to her! She had a beautiful voice and said, “A mean old witch turned me into a brown, ugly toad, and she said the only thing that would turn me back into a unicorn was the tear of a little girl. Thank you for rescuing me from her spell! Gently, the unicorn set Marissa down near the slide. Marissa told the unicorn, “Thank you for helping me! And thank you for the ride!” Before the unicorn flew away, she told Marissa, “You are very welcome, little girl! Just remember: you can’t judge a book by its cover!”"},{"prompt":"Are poisonous and venomous the same thing? I hear some people using the terms interchangeably. Explain the similarities and differences.","completion":"Venomous and poisonous are not the same things. Those that use the terms interchangeably are often unaware of the meanings. Venomous is when a toxin is injected into you via stings or bites. Whereas poisonous is when a toxin can harm you through consumption or touch. There’s an old saying that goes, “If you bite it and you get sick, it’s poisonous. If it bites you and you get sick, it’s venomous.” Some venomous animals, like vipers and other dangerous snakes, are referred to as poisonous in casual conversations. In the same way, venom is often casually referred to as poison because not everyone knows the difference. The only similarity between venomous and poisonous is the damage both can do to someone. Both venom and poison are harmful, albeit in unique ways."},{"prompt":"Recently I’ve been interested in living without a phone. The one thing is I want to know how to figure out the time. Can you tell me some of the ways I can keep track of time without a phone? You can even give me the simplest options because I’m drawing blanks at the moment.","completion":"I can absolutely do that for you, and I’ll give you some of the simplest options to help. 1. Watch - This one seems like a no-brainer, but it can be easy to forget about since so many people have phones. Watches can run for cheap, and if you don’t want to carry a phone around, you can opt for a watch to help you keep tabs on the time at all times. 2. Find a clock - Tons of places still have clocks hanging up somewhere. However, it is less common now because of the widespread use of phones. 3. Ask someone - If you don’t have a watch and there’s no clock, you can also ask someone. If you’re in a store or somewhere with employees, you can ask them. You can also ask coworkers and friends if you’re working or out and about with others. 4. Look at the sun - This will only give you a relative track of what time it is, but it can help. When the sun is halfway up in the sky, it’s about noon. It also rises in the East and sets in the West. By looking at where the sun is in the sky, you can get a relative idea of the time. 5. Get some other cheap device that tells the time - Even Tomagachi’s have ways to tell the time. If you don’t want to keep a phone, but you’re fine with some other piece of tech you’re less tied to, try to find another device that tells the time. Most handheld video game consoles will tell you what time it is, and some can fit right in your pocket.

Help me brainstorm different ideas and things I could do to make learning it a bit easier and how each idea might help.","completion":"It is always a good thing to try something new! Here are some ideas I hope will help you: - Pick an easy type - Some types of dancing are far more complicated and harder to learn than others. So, try to start off with one that is simpler and easier. - Watch it - Sometimes watching someone else do something can help you understand better what it is you are supposed to be doing. Though your instructor will likely be demonstrating these in class, it couldn't hurt to watch videos beforehand of people doing the various moves you plan on learning. - Research - Along with watching, you can also learn some of the different terms you may have to use during your classes. Even if you don't know what these terms mean, knowing the words will give you a little bit of a head start. - Prepare - Most types of dance require you to be relaxed to some degree. So you may want to prepare ahead of time by doing stretches or something to relax your muscles. I hope you succeed in learning to dance!"},{"prompt":"How and why did Princess Diana die?","completion":"Princess Diana died in a car accident in Paris, alongside her partner Dodi Fayed.

I know you help make rules for our state. I learned that in school. I think we need a new rule. All weekends should be three days long. If we had three days for the weekend we could do a lot more stuff. We could spend more time with our family and pets. We would have more time to clean our rooms. It would also give us another day to get our homework done. I think kids and grownups would all agree on a three-day weekend. Grownups need a break too. Two days aren't enough to relax and do all the fun things we want to do. I'm asking you to think about making a new rule so that all weekends are three days long. I think everyone would be really happy with you if you did. I can't vote yet, but I would vote for you if you gave us three-day weekends.

Keep it under 350 words.","completion":"A cruise ship once left the docks of Honolulu, Hawaii, but it did not go very far. The ship suffered damage almost immediately and had to make an emergency stop on a nearby smaller island. To make matters worse, the ship's rescue boats were not able to be loosened. Thankfully, some dolphins were available in the ocean to carry the shipwrecked people back to the Hawaiian shores. One of the shipwrecked passengers had a pet monkey on board with him. This monkey was very mischievous as it kept getting into trouble. The monkey would often steal coconut energy drinks from his owner. While the people were waiting to hitch a ride on a dolphin's back, the monkey jumped off the ship with a coconut energy drink in hand. The monkey then pretended to drown in the ocean. Mistaking the monkey for a human, one dolphin swam over to the monkey and made the monkey climb on its back. The dolphin started taking the monkey back to the shore. The monkey sat up and started drinking the coconut energy drink. \\"Are you a citizen of Honolulu?\\" the dolphin asked politely. \\"Of course I am! I ran for Mayor of Honolulu last year!\\" the monkey replied while sipping on his drink. \\"Are you drinking something, by any chance?\\" the dolphin asked. \\"Yes! It's a coconut energy drink! I'll save some for you when we hit the shore!\\" the monkey replied. Suddenly, the human owner who had lost the monkey caught up with him riding on another dolphin. \\"Hey! Give me back my monkey! Slow down, dolphin!\\" The dolphin immediately stopped swimming forward and looked up to see the monkey. He tossed the monkey off his back, and the human owner caught the monkey in mid-air. The owner then tossed the coconut energy drink to the dolphin as a reward. \\"Why do you always lie and deceive, you fool?\\" the human owner wagged his index finger at the monkey. Then the second dolphin abruptly tossed the human owner onto the Hawaiian shores once they came close enough."},{"prompt":"Please write me a paragraph for an article about Lebron James. Make sure the paragraph touches on his value as a prospect, his NBA career, and his personal life. Write at least 150 words. This should serve as an introductory paragraph to set up the rest of the article.","completion":"The most highly touted American athlete since Michael Jordan, Lebron James had higher expectations than any athlete in history, and the amazing part is that he has by all accounts exceeded those expectations. Now 35, Lebron James has dominated the league for 17 years. In 2002, as a high school student, Lebron was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the title \\"The Chosen One\\". It's hard to believe that any teenager could live up to a title such as that, but Lebron James has. Since the Sports Illustrated cover, all that James has done is win 4 NBA titles, 4 NBA MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. He has received MVP votes in every single season of his career. Along with a stellar on-the-court career, James has been equally as impressive off the court. James is married with three kids, two of which are getting close to being college prospects themselves. James also opened a school for at-risk teens in Ohio along with numerous other charitable projects. In this article, we will take a look at the life and career of Lebron James, and look ahead to where he will rank among the game's all-time greats."},{"prompt":"Give me a Python code that will work as a random number generator to print a multiple of 3 from 3 to 3000.","completion":"The \`random\` module will enable you to generate a random number to your specifications.

Include detail and name the fish Carson.","completion":"Carson the fish wanted nothing more than to smell the small white flower, peeking out from the edge of the sand on the shore. He poked his head above the salty waves, staring at the delicate petals. The flower would smell sweet, fruity, and delicate. It would be life-changing - he knew it. One day, as Carson stared at the flower, he felt a sharp pain on the lower side of his body. What - he looked down and saw two small, green legs sprouting from his body! They were covered in scales like the rest of his body, harboring the same delicate blue design. Did they work? He carefully moved them. They worked! Carson booked it toward the shore, a goal already in mind. Carson skyrocketed onto the sand, ignoring the hot granules as they burned his new feet. He pushed towards the white flower and shoved his face in the center. It tickled his nose and he sneezed, washing pollen over his face. The smell was sweet. It was delicate, perfect.

Don't use more than 300 words, and focus on the main character’s thoughts and emotions.","completion":"“Come on,” you shout in frustration. “Just a little more!” It wasn’t as if your words of encouragement could really provide any tangible results, but the shouting and pounding did help relieve your pent-up feelings. You pound your fist against the pane. Only an inch of glass, but it might as well be a mile. On the other side of the glass, you see the neat rows of soldiers, all perfectly in place, with the one straggler. You try in vain to get his attention. No amount of yelling, shaking, or slamming has any effect. Your cursing goes unnoticed. It’s not as if you have any coin left to bribe him, anyways. “Almost out to freedom, but nope, never my luck.” You give a weary sigh. “Days upon days of the same monotony...” A fortnight of days in this sterile and artificial cage.

For example, if you’re processing credit card payments on your website, TLS and SSL can help you securely process that data so that malicious actors can’t get their hands on it. So what’s the difference between TLS vs SSL? Well, TLS is actually just a more recent version of SSL. It fixes some security vulnerabilities in the earlier SSL protocols. Before you learn more about the specifics, it’s important to understand the basic history of SSL and TLS. SSL 2.0 was first released in February 1995 (SSL 1.0 was never publicly released because of security flaws). Although SSL 2.0 was publicly released, it also contained security flaws and was quickly replaced by SSL 3.0 in 1996. Then, in 1999, the first version of TLS (1.0) was released as an upgrade to SSL 3.0. Since then, there have been three more TLS releases, with the most recent release being TLS 1.3 in August 2018.","completion":"TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) are both cryptographic protocols that authenticate a connection and encrypt data on the Internet.

Please pull from specific spots in the text within your answer. He looked at me with his mouth open and his dark eyes very big. It was as though he had just discovered that I was an expert on bedbugs. I laughed and grabbed his head as I had done God knows how many times before, when I was playing with him or when he had annoyed me. But this time when I touched him something happened in him and in me which made this touch different from any touch either of us had ever known. And he did not resist, as he usually did, but lay where I had pulled him, against my chest. And I realized that my heart was beating in an awful way and that Joey was trembling against me and the light in the room was very bright and hot. I started to move and to make some kind of joke but Joey mumbled something and I put my head down to hear. Joey raised his head as I lowered mine and we kissed, as it were, by accident. Then, for the first time in my life, I was really aware of another person’s body, of another person’s smell. We had our arms around each other. It was like holding in my hand some rare, exhausted, nearly doomed bird which I had miraculously happened to find. I was very frightened; I am sure he was frightened too, and we shut our eyes. To remember it so clearly, so painfully tonight tells me that I have never for an instant truly forgotten it. I feel in myself now a faint, a dreadful stirring of what so overwhelmingly stirred in me then, great thirsty heat, and trembling, and tenderness so painful I thought my heart would burst. But out of this astounding, intolerable pain came joy; we gave each other joy that night. It seemed, then, that a lifetime would not be long enough for me to act with Joey the act of love.","completion":"The passage is negative in emotion. The words awful, exhausted, doomed, frightened, painfully, and dread denote this. For the word \\"awful,\\" the narrator describes their heart beating in a way they do not want it to. \\"Exhausted\\" denotes tiredness and describes both the narrator and Joey. The word \\"doomed\\" describes both of them, too, with each dooming the other after accidentally kissing and instilling fear within the passage. \\"Frightened\\" accentuates this feeling of fear, furthering the negative tone, and the action of shutting their eyes makes this scene feel immoral. The word \\"painfully\\" is brought about as the narrator remembers this memory, thus classifying it as something unpleasant to remember. The word \\"dread\\" adds once more to the feeling of fear, creating a feeling of impending doom in the actions that occurred in this scene. Even though the ending states that they gave each other joy that night, the majority of this passage is negative."},{"prompt":"Come up with the first few paragraphs of a short story about a time traveler named Greg, his imaginary mouse Gary, and his love interest, Julia.","completion":"It felt different than he expected, like he was watching something he shouldn't be.

He didn't even know for certain if Gary was real or not. He seemed real. It certainly felt real when he bit Greg's finger, and he had certainly cleaned up real blood off the linoleum. BOOM! Greg still jumped, although he was expecting this. His younger self, although not visible at the moment, had just inadvertently discovered the key to unlocking the cosmic web of space and time. Young Greg was naive, as Greg remembered, and certainly oblivious to the consequences of what he had just stumbled on to. Oddly enough, the explosion was related to the purpose of this little adventure. Greg needed to find out where he had hidden the algorithm to reboot the corrupted files in his machine. What had gone wrong wasn't important right now. What mattered was finding where he hid the code from himself so that he could save Julia."},{"prompt":"I want to know Steve Kerr's nationality and where and when he was born, written in sentence format. Stephen Douglas Kerr (born September 27, 1965) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach of the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is known as one of the most accurate three-point shooters of all time, and one of the greatest coaches in NBA history. He is a nine-time NBA champion, having won five titles as a player (three with the Chicago Bulls and two with the San Antonio Spurs) as well as four with the Warriors as a head coach. Kerr is the only NBA player to win four straight NBA titles after 1969. Kerr has the highest career three-point field goal percentage (45.4%) in NBA history for any player with at least 250 three-pointers made. He also held the NBA record for the highest three-point percentage in a season at 52.4% until the record was broken by Kyle Korver in 2010. Kerr was born in Beirut, Lebanon, to Malcolm H.

I know I am!” She smiled. “Did you bring back the ‘homework’ from last week?” Even without looking, Ang knew the parents were watching, so the show had to be perfectly presented until the last of them trickled out the door. Feigning affection and presenting herself perfectly was something that she had long ago mastered, and the power it gave was addicting. Ang never tired of small talk and convincing the parents that she really did care about their mundane lives; once they trusted her, they brought her the never-ending supply of the wonderful free labor she needed for her plans. “Have a seat, my angels, and gather around,” Ang said, smiling warmly and gesturing calmly. “Today, we’re going to talk about the turquoise stones from the Southwest. Each one of you has a bowl I’ve got for you, and you can pick them up and look at them! Ang droned on, purposely keeping the tone light and simple, childlike and repetitive to bore the parents. Her monologue was, in fact, educational but simplistic enough that finally the last parent grew weary of listening and finally departed. Ang turned to her desk, and when she turned around, ruler in hand, her demeanor had completely changed; her face was contorted in rage, and she seemed to tower over the cowering children. “Production numbers are down, again!” Ang shouted. “You needed to make twelve necklaces for homework last week, but most of you FAILED!” Ang glared menacingly around the room. Some of the smaller children’s lips were quivering. “Good,” she thought. “Fear ought to be the proper motivator to reach the month’s budget.” Ang glanced over to the nearest potential scapegoat. “Daisy,” she said softly. “You like juice boxes, right?” The small girl looked up hopefully from the box she was sipping. “Yes, I love ‘em-these berry ones are soo good!” “NO JUICE BOXES EVER AGAIN UNTIL WE MEET THE QUOTA,” Ang raged, slapping the box from her hand to the floor. “God gave you little fingers to put the beads on the wire, and that’s what you’re going to do!” One way or another, they were going to be the most profitable Etsy store ever!"},{"prompt":"Complete this sentence in ten different ways: “She twirled in the center of her bedroom…”.

Inside its gnarled branches sat a mother cardinal on a nest of twigs covering two speckled little eggs. Danny watched from afar as she carefully tended to her clutch, keeping the eggs warm and safe. The days dragged on, and the brilliant red father cardinal continued to bring bugs and other little snacks to the mother so that she wouldn’t have to move from their blessed clutch. Their patience and dedication were rewarded when the eggs hatched into tiny, fluffy chicks. Springing into action, the mother cardinal struck out to find the insects and seeds her hungry brood needed to grow big. Then one day, Danny’s hungry cat Zoe escaped the house and started to prowl the backyard in search of a snack. The old cat’s sharp eyes soon found the cardinal's nest. The mother cardinal was no fool. She’d seen cats before and quickly changed her focus from finding food to defending her young from the nefarious predator. With the fierce determination of a mother, she swooped down darting towards the cat to ward it off. She fluttered her wings and chirped in the cat’s ear. Zoe was startled by the sudden attack, and backed away, feeling momentarily intimidated. The mother cardinal knew the cat’s resolve would soon return, so she continued to defend her nest, flying back and forth, trying to frighten the cat. She was determined not to let her chicks fall victim to Zoe’s insatiable hunger. Startled by the bird’s bravado, Zoe gave up and retreated, defeated by the mother cardinal's fierce determination. Seeing what had happened, Danny rushed out to retrieve his mischievous cat before it could do any real harm. Day after day, Danny watched the babies grow through his binoculars. Each morning, it seemed they were changing. Growing feathers, opening their eyes, and getting ready for flight. All the while, Danny kept cantankerous Zoe trapped in the house. By the ninth day, the chicks had grown into full-fledged cardinals, ready to take flight and begin their own lives. Once the temptation was gone, Zoe was once again set free to wander the yard in search of her next quarry."},{"prompt":"Write an opening paragraph for a speech I'm giving.

Theodore Palaiologos was born in 1452,[1] the son of Paulos Palaiologos.[1][2] Paulos was probably from the Morea (the medieval name for the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece) and Theodore was likely born at Mystras, the peninsula's capital.[1][2][3] They shared their last name with the Palaiologos dynasty, the final ruling dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, but are unlikely to have been related to the imperial family.[2] The Palaiologos family had been extensive even before they became the empire's ruling dynasty,[3] so it is plausible that Theodore and his family were distant cousins of the emperors. Theodore had three siblings; Georgios (Giorgio or Zorzi in Italian), Matthew (who would become the abbot of a monastery on Zakynthos) and a sister whose name remains unknown.[2] In his youth, Theodore originally worked as a soubashi (debt-collector/police enforcer) in the Peloponnese on behalf of the Ottoman Empire, which conquered the Morea in 1460, before he, his father,[1] and his brother Georgios,[2] took up service with the Republic of Venice as stratioti (light-armed mercenary cavalrymen)[1][3] in 1478.[1] In due time, Paulos, Theodore and Georgios would all rise through the ranks to become capo dei stratioti (\\"head of the stratioti\\").[2]","completion":"1) Theodore Palaiologos was born in the year 1452. 2) The text does not reference when Theodore Palaiologos died. 3) Soubashi is a debt collector or a police enforcer. 4) Theodore Palaiologos did not have 4 siblings, he had 3.

Here's the article: Sebago Lake (Sih-Bay-Goh) is the deepest and second-largest lake in the U.S. state of Maine. The lake is 316 feet (96 m) deep at its deepest point, with a mean depth of 101 feet (31 m). It is possible that Sebago is the deepest lake wholly contained within the entire New England region, although some sources say that Vermont's Lake Willoughby is slightly deeper. Along with Lake Champlain, Sebago is one of the only lakes in the area that does not consistently freeze solid during the winter months, with total ice cover only occurring for a short period of time every few winters. Sebago covers about 45 square miles (117 km2) in surface area, has a length of 14 miles (23 km) and has a shoreline length of roughly 105 miles (169 km).[2] The surface is around 270 feet (82 m) above sea level, so the deep bottom is below the present sea level.[3] It is in Cumberland County, and bordered by the towns of Casco, Naples, Raymond, Sebago, Standish and Windham. The seasonally occupied town of Frye Island is on an island in the lake. Sebago Lake and the surrounding area is known for its erratic and sudden changes in weather during all seasons, likely due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and to Mt. Washington, a very notorious extreme weather hotspot.

Although this is not to say that assassin champions in the mid lane are not being played anymore. The Mid Lane has established itself as the favorite line of hundreds of players due to its versatility and importance within the game, not surprisingly, many of the most famous players in the World Championship Tournaments are also players in the mid lane. TOP The top line is a long, lateral and individual lane; being therefore the most isolated line of the game. It is a perfect line for those players who love to compare their skills against another player in a constant fight for control of the lane. Normally, tanks or fighters are usually played in the top lane like Sett, Dr Mundo, Yorick, among others. This line, in League of Legends, is the closest thing to a 1v1. This is due to its very nature, since being the farthest line on the map, you will have less support (the jungler usually plays around the Dragon of the BOT lane), so the most popular summoner is Teleport.

It was cotton, with a pretty pastel floral pattern and big puffy sleeves. The perfect kind of airy dress for a summer picnic, but not exactly something for the fancy dinner we had scheduled for tonight. I didn’t say anything, but clearly, my expression was loud enough. She lowered the dress, looking a little disappointed. “It suits you,” I offered, but the damage was done. We moved to the next rack, both of us pawing through the clothes on offer, none of them really speaking out to us. This was why I hated shopping, especially for clothes. I was so particular about things: the fabric, the cut, the pattern, the vibe. My sister, on the other hand, was not. She thought a summer dress was fancy-dinner appropriate. Perhaps it would suit my sister, but unfortunately, I put a lot of time and effort into planning things out. My family liked to say I’m too type-A, that I need to take things easy but I can’t and they will just have to accept that. “Oh, I think I found it!” I turned around to see another dress in my sister’s hands. Somehow she managed to find something even worse than the summer dress. It was dark, short, and slinky with some glittery fabric. Perfect for clubbing, but not exactly what I imagined for my party. I didn’t respond, just turned back to the rack and kept looking."},{"prompt":"Write a eulogy for my hermit crab, Drake. he liked lettuce and he always kept his cage really clean. i think he died of old age, but i don't know.","completion":"Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to mourn the passing of one of the finest crustaceans that ever crawled on this earth, Drake.

How To Prevent Snake Plant Leaves From Turning Yellow The snake plant is a beautiful plant that is easy to care for, grows in many different environments, and looks good almost anywhere. But even with all these wonderful benefits, there are some things you should know about this plant before you buy it. If the leaves of your snake plant turn yellow, it might not be a problem immediately, but when you see more yellow leaves, you should try to find out why. The snake plant is a houseplant with small clumps of white or cream-colored flowers at the end of long stalks. Let’s find out why snake plant leaves turn yellow and possible solutions. Causes of Snake Plant Leaves Turning Yellow There are a few reasons that snake plant leaves turn yellow. Discussed below are some of the major reasons. 1. Lack of Water The snake plant needs a lot of water to stay green. Therefore, it is essential to see and treat this problem very soon. Water should be provided at least once a week and more often during the summer when the plant is growing faster. Daily watering might not be sufficient at all times. 2. Overwatering The leaves will turn yellow if a snake plant is left in water for too long. This happens because the roots of the plant cannot absorb all the available water and can be soaked up by the soil. Some snake plants are better than others because they don’t seem to mind being watered too much. Others might not be strong enough to handle over-watering, so it’s important to check for this problem often. 3. Lack of Nutrients The snake plant doesn’t need many nutrients to remain healthy, but they do need some. If the plant has been neglected for longer than a week or two, the problem will be more serious and require a solution for more than just water. A nutrient deficiency occurs when you feed the plant too little over time. The leaves will start to have a yellowing problem which will spread over time. 4. Over-fertilization Over-fertilization is particularly a problem for people who like to feed their plants but don’t want to buy fertilizer. The difference between fertilizing and over-fertilizing the snake plant is that fertilizers have slightly different ingredients in various mixtures. This can confuse people unfamiliar with the difference and think it’s okay to use certain things like coffee grounds, which are not good for the snake plant. The way you know if you are over-fertilizing is that the plant will get too much water and too many nutrients. The plant will also turn yellow on the leaves, and it might look unhealthy, which is bad.","completion":"Snake plants are beautiful, low-maintenance houseplants that thrive in various conditions. However, yellow leaves on your snake plant may indicate something is wrong. Leaves turning yellow often indicates too much or too little water. Snake plants tend to be thirsty, but it's still essential to avoid overwatering. Nutrient imbalance is another common reason for snake plant leaves to become yellow. If the yellowing problem spreads slowly over time, the plant may not be getting sufficient nutrients. Nonetheless, snake plants aren't heavy feeders and need the proper balance of nutrients to thrive. Overfertilization is another reason the leaves may turn yellow."},{"prompt":"What is the largest spider on earth?","completion":"The largest spider on Earth is the Goliath birdeater. A member of the tarantula family, this spider can weigh up to 6 ounces and can measure up to 5 inches in length, making it the largest spider by mass and body length in the world; when measuring size by leg span, only the giant huntsman spider is larger. The Goliath birdeater gets its name from its size and diet, as it does feed on birds. However, this is a rare meal for the spider, which more commonly eats anthropods, worms, and even amphibians.

He checked through the keyhole - a box. That's it. \\"Well that guy took off in a hurry,\\" he thought. He opened the door, picked up the package and went back inside before the cool air all leaked outside. It was addressed to him. Name, address, everything. But it wasn't a typical shipping box you'd get from one of the usual online retailers, it felt oddly...smooth? Slick? He couldn't remember ordering anything, either. He gave it a moment of thought before grabbing his keys and scratching one along the tape, opening the box easily. Some packing materials, and a small, nondescript cube. That's it. He couldn't even tell if it was plastic, or maybe ceramic? It didn't feel like it was something heavy like metal. \\"HELLO!\\" A voice rang out from the box, now displaying a face on one side. \\"Ow. Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you! Don't worry, I'm not dangerous!\\" Well, that was an odd thing to say. He picked the small cube up again, staring at the face. \\"Well, what do you do? Are you like a personal assistant?\\" \\"Nope, I'm definitely not that!\\" The cube laughed. \\"Don't worry, I'm not going to steal your data or anything.\\" Edgar blinked at that comment. \\"Wait, why would you steal my data?\\" \\"I wouldn't, I just told you that!\\" The face frowned at him now, admonishing him. \\"I'm not that kind of device!\\" Edgar massaged his temples. \\"Okay, then what kind of device are you?\\" The device stopped talking and put on a quizzical expression. It sat silent for what seemed like a full minute, and then said, \\"Well, I'm definitely not the kind that takes control of your bank account and all of your streaming services. So rest assured, you're fine!\\" Edgar groaned and tossed the device back into the box. Was there a number on it? Does anyone actually have customer service numbers now? There it is!

Madeleine McCann: Portugal reservoir search ends after three days A fresh search linked to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal has ended. Portuguese authorities said material recovered during the three-day operation around the Arade reservoir in the Algarve would now be analysed. The German police-led operation was looking for evidence to link the British toddler's disappearance to Christian Brueckner, a German national. He was made a formal suspect by Portuguese prosecutors in 2022. German prosecutors have named Brueckner as the main suspect in their Madeleine McCann murder investigation. British police do not use that phrase, saying that as far as they are concerned it is still a missing person investigation. The search at the Arade reservoir near Silves was part of the German investigation. They asked Portuguese officials for assistance, and the Metropolitan Police said its officers were also in Portugal so they can inform Madeleine's family of any developments. A statement from Portugal's national police agency said the \\"collected material\\" from the scene will be delivered to the German authorities for further inspection. All the work carried out around the reservoir was on a peninsula jutting out into the Arade dam from its Western shore - 31 miles (50km) from where Madeleine went missing in Praia da Luz 16 years ago. Officers were seen using rakes and hoes, strimmers and a small excavator to clear paths through the scrub on a nearby slope - the sound of machinery at work audible in the remote area. Police also dug a number of smaller holes, leaving huge piles of soil and broken rock next to the 160 sq ft (14 sq m) excavation area. The spit of land has a small car park on it, which is often used as an unofficial campsite. Brueckner, a 45-year-old German national, is thought to have stayed there often in his Volkswagen T3 camper van. He is also known to have visited the picturesque spot around the time Madeleine, who would now be 20, went missing. White tents were set up on the site and sniffer dogs were used. However, no divers were seen going under the water. German authorities have not revealed what triggered the latest search operation but state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said they were acting on the basis of \\"certain tips\\". He told German public broadcaster NDR: \\"We have indications that we could find evidence there. I don't want to say what that is exactly, and I also don't want to say where these indications come from. \\"The only thing that I would clarify is that it doesn't come from the suspect - so we don't have a confession or anything similar now, or an indication from the suspect of where it would make sense to search.\\" Mr Wolters is treating Brueckner as the main suspect in Madeleine's case, although he has never been charged over Madeleine's disappearance and has denied any involvement. Madeleine disappeared from a holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz on 3 May 2007, nine days before her fourth birthday. Hers has become one of the most infamous missing person's cases in modern times, attracting attention in countries across Europe, and in America and Australia. News crews from around the world remain stationed around the Arade reservoir, where they are reporting the latest developments. Brueckner was living near the Praia da Luz resort when the McCann family was on holiday, and he spent time in the area between 2000 and 2017. He is currently in prison in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman in 2005 in the same area where Madeleine went missing.","completion":"Madeleine McCann: Portugal reservoir search ends after three days A fresh search linked to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal has ended.

Include only 3 different overall tip categories.","completion":"How to get better, more restful sleep: 1. Keep a sleep schedule - Make sure you set aside no more than 8 hours for sleeping. The recommended amount of sleep you should get, for a healthy adult, is at least 7 hours per day. Try to get up at the same set time every day of the week, as having a consistent sleep pattern re-inforces your body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Furthermore, if you aren't able to fall asleep within 20 minutes, leave your room and do something relaxing, like listening to soothing music. Do this until you find yourself getting tired. 2. Be aware of what you eat and drink before bed - Don't go to bed hungry or overly full. Avoid having heavy or large amounts of food for at least a couple of hours before trying to sleep. Nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine are things you should be cautious about as well. Nicotine and caffeine are stimulating, and the effects of that can take hours to wear off, which interferes with your sleep. 3. Make a restful environment for sleeping - Keep where you sleep cool, quiet, and dark. Exposing yourself to light before resting makes it more challenging to sleep, and bright screens should be avoided before bedtime. Consider using tools like earplugs, a fan, or room- darkening window shades to create a more restful sleep environment."},{"prompt":"Can I get a list of things to do while visiting Toronto?

Food storage in this way works best with temperatures between 32 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit with relatively high humidity. By building a root cellar with good ventilation, light filtration, and humidity control, you can ensure stable long-term storage of a variety of foods. The combination of the proper environmental factors allows the decomposition process of food to stop and allows food to be preserved without bacterial growth or drying out.

Brady's lone touchdown pass was an eight-yarder to wide receiver David Patten in the second quarter. The rest of New England's scoring came from a pick-six by cornerback Ty Law and field goals from Adam Vinatieri, who drilled the 48-yard game-winner as time expired. Brady's stats: 16/27, 145 yards, 1 TD, 0 INT, 86.2 rating Final score: 20-17, Patriots photo via AP 03 Super Bowl XXXVIII: vs. Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXXVIII: vs. Carolina Panthers 3 / 10 Brady's second Super Bowl appearance was just as exciting as the first. This time, it was a thrilling victory over the Carolina Panthers. A record 37 points were scored in the fourth quarter between the two teams. Brady tallied three touchdown passes, the most notable one being a 1-yard toss to ex-Pats linebacker and current Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel in the fourth quarter. Brady's stats: 32/48, 354 yards, 3 TD, 1 INT, 100.5 rating Final score: 32-29, Patriots photo via AP ADVERTISEMENT 04 Super Bowl XXXIX: vs. Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXXIX: vs. Philadelphia Eagles 4 / 10 Super Bowl No. 3 of Brady's illustrious career wasn't his best, but once again he found a way to lead his team to victory. Brady only tossed one touchdown pass, taking a page from the Super Bowl XXXVIII playbook and connecting with Vrabel for a 2-yard score. With Freddie Mitchell and Terrell Owens on the opposite sideline, there was plenty of talking heading into this matchup. It was Brady, though, who had the last laugh and a perfect 3-0 Super Bowl record to boot. Brady's stats: 23/33, 236 yards, 2 TD, 0 INT, 110.2 rating Final score: 24-21, Patriots photo via AP 05 Super Bowl XLII: vs. New York Giants Super Bowl XLII: vs. New York Giants 5 / 10 Brady's first Super Bowl loss couldn't have been much more crushing. It wasn't just the fact the Patriots fell short of going a perfect 19-0 on the season, it was the manner in which it unfolded. New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning somehow escaped a sack to connect with receiver David Tyree, who made the infamous \\"helmet catch.\\" The Giants finished their miraculous drive with a touchdown, and the rest is history. Randy Moss was on the receiving end of Brady's lone touchdown pass. Brady's stats: 29/48, 266 yards, 1 TD, 0 INT, 86.5 rating Final score: 17-14, Giants photo via AP 06 Super Bowl XLVI: vs. New York Giants Super Bowl XLVI: vs. New York Giants 6 / 10 The Patriots-Giants Super Bowl rematch four years later was déjà vu for Brady and Co. New England held a 17-15 lead until the final minute of the fourth quarter, when running back Ahmad Bradshaw scampered into the end zone for what would be the game-winning touchdown. To put themselves in position to steal another victory away from the Patriots, the Giants had another miraculous David Tyree-like moment. Eli Manning found Mario Manningham along the left sideline for a 38-yard gain to produce another highlight Pats fans will forever avoid at all costs. Brady's stats: 27/41, 276 yards, 2 TD, 1 INT, 91.5 rating Final score: 21-17, Giants photo via AP ADVERTISEMENT 07 Super Bowl XLIX: vs. Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl XLIX: vs. Seattle Seahawks 7 / 10 The Patriots found themselves down 10 points late in the third quarter before Brady tossed touchdown passes to Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman to take a 28-24 lead late in the fourth quarter They left too much time on the clock for Russell Wilson and the Seahawks, who nearly had their own New York Giants moment vs. the Patriots. Jermaine Kearse made a near-impossible 33-yard catch with one minute left in regulation to put Seattle in a position to seal the win. Then, the Seahawks decided to not use Marshawn Lynch at the one-yard line. Instead, they attempted a slant pass to Ricardo Lockette that was picked off by rookie reserve cornerback Malcolm Butler, thus giving the Patriots the victory. Butler's play is considered one of the greatest plays in NFL history. Brady's stats: 37/50, 328 yards, 4 TD, 2 INT, 101.1 rating Final score: 28-24, Patriots photo via AP 08 Super Bowl LI: vs. Atlanta Falcons Super Bowl LI: vs. Atlanta Falcons 8 / 10 Yet another game that serves as a reminder Brady and the Patriots never make it easy on themselves in the Super Bowl. But it was also a reminder never to count out one of the greatest QBs who has ever lived. The Patriots were down 28-3 late in the third quarter, then stormed back to send the game into overtime where running back James White finished the comeback off with a 2-yard touchdown run. Brady struggled mightily in the first half, but was sensational in engineering the greatest comeback in NFL history. When looking back on the best moments of Brady's career, this likely will be the first game that comes to mind.

The Lakeview was an expensive restaurant, one of those places where a headwaiter dressed in tails conducted you to your seat, and the only light came from candles and flaming desserts. In one corner of the room a lady harpist played tinkling melodies. Father wanted to celebrate, because he had just been promoted. He worked for an electronics company, and after his English started improving, his superiors decided to appoint him to a position more suited to his training. The promotion not only brought a higher salary but was also a tremendous boost to his pride. Up to then we had eaten only in Chinese restaurants. Although my brother and I were becoming fond of hamburgers, my parents didn’t care much for western food, other than chow mein. But this was a special occasion, and father asked his coworkers to recommend a really elegant restaurant. So there we were at the Lakeview, stumbling after the headwaiter in the murky dining room. At our table we were handed our menus, and they were so big that to read mine I almost had to stand up again. But why bother? It was mostly in French, anyway. Father, being an engineer, was always systematic. He took out a pocket French dictionary. “They told me that most of the items would be in French, so I came prepared.” He even had a pocket flashlight, the size of a marking pen. While mother held the flashlight over the menu, he looked up the items that were in French. “Paté en croute,” he muttered. “Let’s see … paté is paste … croute is crust … hmm … a paste in crust.” The waiter stood looking patient. I squirmed and died at least fifty times. At long last Father gave up. “Why don’t we just order four complete dinners at random?” he suggested. “Isn’t that risky?” asked Mother. “The French eat some rather peculiar things, I’ve heard.” “A Chinese can eat anything a Frenchman can eat,” Father declared. The soup arrived in a plate. How do you get soup up from a plate? I glanced at the other diners, but the ones at the nearby tables were not on their soup course, while the more distant ones were invisible in the darkness. Fortunately my parents had studied books on western etiquette before they came to America. “Tilt your plate,” whispered my mother. “It’s easier to spoon the soup up that way.” She was right. Tilting the plate did the trick. But the etiquette book didn’t say anything about what you did after the soup reached your lips. As any respectable Chinese knows, the correct way to eat your soup is to slurp. This helps to cool the liquid and prevent you from burning your lips. It also shows your appreciation. We showed our appreciation. Shloop, went my father. Shloop, went my mother. Shloop, shloop, went my brother, who was the hungriest. The lady harpist stopped playing to take a rest. And in the silence, our family’s consumption of soup suddenly seemed unnaturally loud. You know how it sounds on a rocky beach when the tide goes out and the water drains from all those little pools? They go shloop, shloop, shloop. That was the Lin family, eating soup. At the next table a waiter was pouring wine. When a large shloop reached him, he froze. The bottle continued to pour, and red wine flooded the tabletop and into the lap of a customer. Even the customer didn’t notice anything at first, being also hypnotized by the shloop, shloop, shloop. It was too much. “I need to go to the toilet,” I mumbled, jumping to my feet. A waiter, sensing my urgency, quickly directed me to the ladies’ room. I splashed cold water on my burning face, and as I dried myself with a paper towel, I stared into the mirror. In this perfumed ladies’ room, with its pink and silver wallpaper and marbled sinks, I looked completely out of place. What was I doing here? What was our family doing in the Lakeview restaurant? In America? The door to the ladies’ room opened. A woman came in and glanced curiously at me. I retreated into one of the toilet cubicles and latched the door. Time passed—maybe half an hour, maybe an hour. Then I heard the door open again, and my mother’s voice. “Are you in there? You’re not sick, are you?” There was real concern in her voice. A girl can’t leave her family just because they slurp their soup. Besides, the toilet cubicle had a few drawbacks as a permanent residence. “I’m all right,” I said, undoing the latch. Mother didn’t tell me how the rest of the dinner went, and I didn’t want to know. In the weeks following, I managed to push the whole thing into the back of my mind, where it jumped out at me only a few times a day. Even now, I turn hot all over when I think of the Lakeview restaurant.","completion":"Then came our dinner at the Lakeview restaurant. The Lakeview was an extravagant establishment, known for its refined atmosphere and exquisite cuisine. As flies buzzing around the dining room, we couldn't help but marvel at the grandeur of the place. The headwaiter, dressed in tails, gracefully guided us to our designated spot. Soft candlelight and the delicate melodies of a harpist filled the air, creating an ambiance of sophistication. Our presence in the restaurant was motivated by the recent success of our fly family. Our father had just been promoted in the world of insect business. He had excelled in his role, and his superiors recognized his talents, leading to a prestigious promotion and increased status among our fellow flies. Usually, our fly family frequented garbage bins and feasted on discarded leftovers. But this was a special occasion, and our father wanted to celebrate in style. He asked his fellow flies for recommendations on an elegant restaurant, and the Lakeview was unanimously suggested. So there we were, entering the Lakeview, attempting to navigate the vast dining room with our tiny wings. We settled down at our table, and the oversized menus were placed before us. Flipping through the elaborate pages, we realized that most of the descriptions were in a language foreign to us. Our fly parents, ever resourceful, had brought along a pocket-sized dictionary. They huddled over it, buzzing with excitement as they attempted to decipher the French terms. \\"Paté en croute,\\" our father buzzed, consulting the dictionary. \\"Paté is paste... croute is crust... Ah, a paste in crust!\\" In the end, father surrendered to the complexities of the menu. \\"Why don't we simply choose four random dishes?\\" he proposed. Mother, ever the cautious one, expressed her concerns. \\"Are you sure that's wise? I've heard that flies have peculiar dietary preferences in different regions.\\" But father was determined. \\"A fly can feast on anything, regardless of its origin,\\" he confidently proclaimed. Soon enough, bowls of soup were placed before us. As flies, we were adept at sipping liquid food, but these shallow plates presented a new challenge. We buzzed around, observing the techniques of the other diners. The dim lighting made it difficult to discern their actions, but we managed to learn a trick or two. Our parents, having researched Western etiquette, guided us. \\"Tilt your plate,\\" they whispered, their wings fluttering with excitement. \\"It makes the soup more accessible.\\" And so, we tilted our plates, dipping our tiny fly mouths into the liquid sustenance. The slurping sounds filled the air, echoing like miniature gusts of wind. A brief pause in the harpist's melodies allowed our symphony of slurps to resonate throughout the restaurant. It was as if the buzzing of flies had taken center stage, captivating the attention of all present. The nearby diners, including humans, stared in awe and disbelief, their eyes widening at the peculiar sight and sound. Amidst the commotion, one unfortunate fly accidentally bumped into a waiter pouring wine at a nearby table. The bottle tipped over, spilling crimson liquid onto the tablecloth and dripping onto an unsuspecting diner's lap. The mishap went unnoticed for a moment, as all eyes were fixed upon our fly family's performance. Unable to bear the intensity of the attention, I fluttered away discreetly, seeking solace in the nearby restroom. Splashing cold water on my tiny face, I reflected upon my peculiar situation. Here I was, a fly in a lavishly decorated restroom, surrounded by pink and silver wallpaper, marbled sinks, and a sense of otherworldly elegance. I couldn't help but question our place in this human-centric world, pondering the meaning of our presence in the Lakeview restaurant. The door swung open, and my mother flew in, her compound eyes scanning the room. \\"Are you in there? Are you unwell?\\" she buzzed with genuine concern. Realizing that I couldn't abandon our family just because of a peculiar dining experience, I replied, undoing the latch, \\"I'm alright.\\" Mother didn't delve into the details of the rest of the dinner, and I didn't press for them. In the following weeks, I managed to push the memory of that surreal evening to the depths of my mind, only to have it resurface a few times each day. Even now, as I buzz around, my tiny fly body shiver with embarrassment at the recollection of the Lakeview restaurant."},{"prompt":"Could you please write a Python function to randomly split people into groups?

We have already stated that Gauss's law for magnetic field is trivial, as there are no magnetic monopoles, but it turns out that there is a separate mathematical law that works for magnetic sources in the same way that Gauss's law works for electric sources. It incorporates \\"enclosed\\" sources, and allows us to use symmetrical situations to solve for fields using methods simpler than integrating Biot-Savart's law. This magnetic version of the electrical Gauss's law is called Ampère's law, and since it can't involve enclosed point sources, it instead deals with lines of current, which either circle back on themselves to form a closed circuit or are infinitely-long (and circle-back on themselves at infinity). But how do we \\"enclose\\" a line of current? In the case of charge, it was enclosed if there was no way to remove the charge from the Gaussian surface without breaking through the surface (i.e. the surface has no holes in it). In the case of Ampere's law, we consider a current to be enclosed by an imaginary closed path – called an Ampèrian circuit – rather than a surface. Such a current is enclosed when there is no way to move the line of current out without it breaking through the Ampèrian circuit.","completion":"Magnets normally have 2 sides, a north and a south pole. They never have just one of the two poles, always coming in pairs. That means that Gauss's Law for magnetic fields just tells us that magnets work differently than how electricity works, so that is not very helpful for our understanding of how they actually work. Since Gauss's law is not very useful, we have another law called Amepere's law, that applies to magnets. This law is really cool because it allows us to understand how magnets make up a magnetic field. In order to do so, we should think about lines of currents. These lines of currents can extend to be infinitely long, or just form a circle. But, these lines of currents aren't like the single point charges we learned about with electricity, so in order to enclose them as we did with a Gaussian surface, we can enclose this super cool line of current with an imaginary fence called an \\"Ameperian circuit\\". This circuit encloses all of what we are wanting to analyze, so we can see how the current and magnets affect the magnetic field."},{"prompt":"There’s supposedly a huge mass of sargassum seaweed coming ashore to Florida this year and it’s bigger than it has ever been. What exactly is this kind of seaweed? I’m particularly interested if it’s safe to swim in or not. I am also curious as to what causes unusually large masses of it.","completion":"Sargassum seaweed is a type of brown algae that is found in salty ocean waters. In appearance, it has leafy appendages and berry-like structures on branches. The “berries” are gas-filled with oxygen and are referred to as “pneumatocysts.” This “seaweed” floats in clumps and “rafts” can stretch for many miles across the ocean. Since it floats, sargassum provides food and breeding grounds to many marine animals like fish, sea turtles, birds, and shrimp. Mahi Mahi fish in particular use the seaweed masses as a breeding ground. It could also be providing food for deep-water fish because once the sargassum loses buoyancy, it sinks to the sea floor. The problems that arise with this type of seaweed is that it builds up along beach shores and emits a gas that reeks of rotten eggs. The rotting grass emits hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic to humans and may cause respiratory issues. The leaves themselves contain arsenic, which is incredibly harmful if ingested or used for fertilizer. Therefore, humans should avoid large quantities of seaweed on the shoreline and also avoid swimming through masses of it. Scientists are unsure what causes sargassum seaweed to bloom in larger than normal amounts. Algae growth is affected by sea currents and thrives on rich nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Human activities like fossil fuel production can dump these wastes into rivers which feed the oceans. So if these levels are elevated in a particular year, then it is likely the seaweed could be more abundant."},{"prompt":"Please write three sentences that use the idiom \\"to defy description\\" correctly.","completion":"- The flavor of this grilled salmon defies description. - The odor of a rotting corpse is so bad that it defies description. - The dance of this ballet prodigy is so amazing it defies description."},{"prompt":"Which is the most appropriate customer support category for this scenario?

Simply put, laser welding devices heat and melt the target material using a laser beam rather than an electrical arc, plasma arc, or gas flame. Laser welders may employ carbon dioxide lasers, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet lasers, fiber lasers, or disk lasers. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages, but they’re all more precise than non-laser types of welders. The fine focus of a laser beam means the pool of melted material generated by the device can be carefully controlled in terms of width, depth, and temperature. That precision also matches well with computer control mechanisms which themselves are more precise than human operators. Taken together, all these advantages make laser welders perfect for high-precision projects on items like circuit boards, jet engines, medical implants, jewelry, and more. As an added bonus, many laser welding devices can create welds in certain ceramic materials and plastics. They’ve also proven capable of welding dissimilar metals to one another. None of these things are possible with traditional welding methods. No technology is perfect, though. Laser welding devices are more expensive than other welders with comparable power outputs. They also demand trained staff who are harder to come by than traditional welding experts. In most cases, the parts themselves need to be carefully prepared; laser welders are less forgiving of imperfect edges than other welding styles. Finally, they are actually more hazardous to eyesight than other welding devices; specialty eye protection is a must when a laser welder is operating."},{"prompt":"Determine if the following Instant Message (IM) from one person to another on social media is innocent, creepy, confusing, romantic, hilarious, warm, cold or stupid: \\"Hey, you!

This following piece of text makes no sense to her. Rewrite the text so that she could understand what offside means. Offside is one of the laws in association football, codified in Law 11 of the Laws of the Game. The law states that a player is in an offside position if any of their body parts, except the hands and arms, are in the opponents' half of the pitch, and closer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent (the last opponent is usually, but not necessarily, the goalkeeper).[1] Being in an offside position is not an offence in itself, but a player so positioned when the ball is played by a teammate can be judged guilty of an offside offence if they receive the ball or will otherwise become \\"involved in active play\\", will \\"interfere with an opponent\\", or will \\"gain an advantage\\" by being in that position. Offside is often considered one of the most difficult to understand aspects of the sport.[2]","completion":"Imagine a football field divided into two halves. If a player is in the opponent's half of the field and closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent (who is usually, but not always, the goalkeeper), they are considered to be in an offside position. However, being in an offside position by itself is not a violation. The key part is when the ball is played by a player's teammate. If the player in the offside position becomes directly involved in the play, like receiving the ball, interfering with an opponent, or gaining an unfair advantage from that position, then they can be penalized for an offside offense. Offside can be a bit tricky to understand because it involves precise positioning and timing. It's about ensuring fairness and preventing players from gaining an unfair advantage by being in the wrong position at the wrong time. To make it even more simple: imagine how unfair it would be for an opponent player to stand right next to the goalkeeper at all times and just wait for the timely assist to be able to score from a point-blank range."},{"prompt":"Okay, I need a friendly response to a Facebook post my neighbor just wrote about finding dog poop in his yard.

The process begins with the creation of a television signal, which contains the information for sound and pictures. These signals are broadcast from a TV station and are transmitted through the airwaves or via cable/satellite systems. The antenna or cable connection on your TV captures these signals. In older CRT televisions, these signals are processed and sent to the electron guns (one each for red, green, and blue - the primary colors of light) in the CRT. Each gun fires a beam of electrons corresponding to the color information in the signal. These beams pass through a magnetic field which causes them to hit specific phosphors on the television screen, lighting them up and creating the image you see. The image is refreshed quickly (usually 60 times per second) to provide the illusion of motion."},{"prompt":"Compy, why does the Hondajet have those weird engine pods on top of the wings? Is it just to be different or is there a valid purpose?","completion":"The Honda Aircraft Company advertises their unusual engine configuration as OTWEM or over-the-wing engine mounts. Though they use it for marketing purposes, the design stemmed from engineering needs. The HondaJet HA-420 is small and sits low to the ground compared to many jet aircraft. There isn’t enough space under the wing to mount a more conventional engine nacelle. Most jet producers who face this problem mount the engines to the sides of the fuselage instead, but that comes with its own set of compromises. Vibrations and noise get conducted directly through the mountings and into the fuselage. Perhaps even more critically, considering the HondaJet’s small airframe, the mounting structure takes up a significant amount of fuselage space. Honda’s engineers decided they could free up interior space by mounting the engines to the wings instead, and settled on the over-the-wing arrangement. The tall spars place the engines largely behind the wing so that they don’t interrupt the airflow and reduce lift."},{"prompt":"How do you say hello in Hawaii?","completion":"Aloha, which is also a movie featuring Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone."},{"prompt":"What’s the capital of Italy?","completion":"Rome.

He could make a sad person laugh and a happy person cry. He was so skilled at manipulating people's emotions, he could control their feelings at will. Everyone loved him, young and old, male and female. People would think about him all the time or do whatever he asked. He didn't even have to ask; people would do things for him because they wanted to please him. Many people got pictures of him to look at, filling their minds with images of him as if he belonged to them. It was like when people imagine owning big houses and fancy cars they've seen. They put more energy into this thought than they put into the work to earn them. So many people who never even touched him fantasized that they were the love of his life. As for me, who used to be free, I fell for his charm when I was young and gave him all my love. But unlike some others, I didn't ask for his attention or give in to him when he asked for mine. I knew I had to protect my honor, so I kept my distance. I had seen enough to know what he was like. His charm was just a mask for his true intentions. But who can avoid trouble just by knowing about it in advance? Who can learn from others' mistakes when our hearts tell us to do otherwise? When we're in love, advice often falls on deaf ears. We don't want to listen to others; we want to experience things for ourselves. It's not easy to resist the things that seem so good, just because others warn us about potential harm. We all have desires that can make us ignore our better judgment. Even when we know it's wrong, we still want to taste the forbidden fruit. I could have told myself that he was a liar. I knew all about his deceitful ways. I had heard about his other relationships and saw how he tricked people using his charm. I knew that his promises were empty and his loving words were just an act. I resisted him for a long time until one day he begged me, \\"Please, take pity on me. Don't be afraid of my love. I promise you, I've never said this to anyone before. I've been invited to love many, but I've never loved or wooed anyone.\\" He went on, \\"All the wrongs you see me do are mistakes of passion, not of my heart. They're not caused by love. Those involved weren't true or kind. They disgraced themselves, and I feel less ashamed by how much their blame includes me. “ \\"Of all the people I've seen, none have warmed my heart or charmed me as you have. I may have hurt others, but I've never been hurt. I've kept others' hearts under my control, but my heart was always free and independent.” \\"Look at these gifts of love sent to me - pearls and rubies red as blood. They represent their love and embarrassment. There are also locks of their hair tied with metal, which I accepted graciously along with their tears. They sent me precious gems and deeply emotional poems, each adding to the beauty and the worth of the gifts. “ There was a diamond - beautiful and strong. A green emerald that could make the weak-sighted feel better. A blue sapphire and an opal that could blend with anything. Each gemstone, described so cleverly, either brought a smile or evoked sadness. \\"All these tokens of passionate love, tender desires and thoughtfulness, Nature has told me not to keep but to give back where I must - to you. You are my beginning and my end. You have to accept these gifts since I'm their alter, and you're my patron.\\""},{"prompt":"I have some horrible writer's block.

They work by heating water to near boiling and routing the steam to a drip area, which disperses water over coffee grounds. The finished brew filters into a pitcher over a warming plate. Depending on the quality of the machine, your coffee may taste either delicious or a bit scorched, but the method is hands-off and convenient. By contrast, French press coffee is usually strong, with a rich, earthy aroma. A French press doesn’t require electricity or disposable filters to brew, just hot water and coffee grounds. The grounds steep directly in hot water, and are then filtered out when the user presses down the plunger. French press is probably the second most hands-off brewing method, after drip.","completion":"Both \\"drip\\" and \\"French press\\" are the most common hands-off coffee brewing methods."},{"prompt":"What does it mean when someone says history is written by the winners?

The context and seriousness of war are often forgotten and never fully understood except by the people that lived through it and were directly involved. Stories, both fiction and non-fiction, are told in movies and books about events such as the Holocaust and The Civil War but this is only a very tiny slice of history."},{"prompt":"What is the tone of this review : (explain) This article originally appeared in the October 2016 issue of ELLE. Unhappy people unsettle me. Angry, unhappy people who blame my gender for their problems make me downright anxious. When those people happen to be women, and they identify the proximate cause of their woes as me, or men in general, or society at large (which is usually just their fancy way of saying \\"men in general\\"), I get positively upset. (\\"Oh, so now you're the victim, and people should just suck it up and get over those centuries of suffering and misogyny?\\" my girlfriend asks when I share my feelings on the subject—which seems to me sort of a trick question, and mean.) Which brings me to The Bitch Is Back: Older, Wiser, and (Getting) Happier (William Morrow), a follow-up to the 2002 best-seller The Bitch in the House: 26 Women Tell the Truth About Sex, Solitude, Work, Motherhood, and Marriage. Before I get to my occasional sense of persecution and other ambivalent reactions to the latest book, a few disclaimers: (1) Cathi Hanauer, the book's editor, is an old friend, and I've always considered her kind, hardworking, a talented novelist, a cheerfully solicitous mother, a loving wife (to a lucky guy who wasn't me), and an all-around good egg. It wasn't until I read The Bitch 1 (as Hanauer calls the original collection) that I realized that she was also often pissed off and miserable. She and her fellow travelers had been raised to believe that they could have satisfying careers, loving marriages, and fully integrated and happy lives as spouses, mothers, earners, leaders, and whatever else they wanted to be with the full support of their broad-minded partners and society at large. And then they got jobs and spouses and had children—and got mad. (2) To point out to someone who's suffering that her unhappiness might be less the fault of society and more the result of something she is thinking or doing, well, that's a politically perilous move. Especially when the sufferer is part of a group that actually has been and often still is victimized, double especially when the pointer-outer belongs to the group that has historically been doing the victimizing. Yes, I'm a middle-aged white man. Unconscious privilege on my part? I think not. However, my girlfriend often begs to differ. (3) My uneasiness/wounded feelings/testimony on behalf of The Patriarchy notwithstanding, I enjoyed both books. The writers are smart, engaging, and—even when I think they're blind to their own idiocy or the problems they're creating for themselves—compelling thinkers and storytellers. In Bitch 2, Hanauer's shorthand for the second book, another 25 women (including 9 of the originals) grapple with the life choices they've made and ponder decisions that lie ahead. They wonder if cosmetic surgery is a betrayal of feminist principles or a recognition of professional reality. They explain why they left loveless marriages or put up with sexless ones. They regard a lust-fueled affair, appreciate their homemaker husbands, detail the rationale for declining to cut a Hawaiian vacation short to come home to Mom, who's suffered a stroke. You might not be surprised to learn that I wondered why, if the bitch has already had her say, she was back. When I telephoned Hanauer to ask, she told me Bitch 2 was about women owning their choices. Less about blame, more about taking responsibility. \\"If the first book is about anger and urgency,\\" she said, \\"this book is about wisdom, and the calm that comes after the storm. How did you channel all that anger from Bitch 1? How did you get to a better place?\\" She told me that she herself was less riled up than she used to be, more accepting, if ruefully so. We talked about children and love and the political and the personal and therapy and mutual friends and why I'm not married. Then I told her that while I appreciated the humor and insight in the book, I didn't think the women from Bitch 2 were all that calm. I detected an undercurrent—still—of man-blaming, a sense that 14 years later, heterosexual marriage was still to these writers about as good for them as oleander. That many still viewed men as clueless at best. The happiest women in the book, I observed, seemed to be the one whose husband handled the child-rearing and homemaking, the single woman who wrote that \\"you need to be a whole person to invite someone into your life,\\" and the lesbian who rediscovered her love for her wife while traveling in Paris. Hanauer said that she too noted the emotional generosity in those three essays, as well as the lingering bad-mouthing of men. Did any instances particularly stick out? she asked me. Actually, they did—and so I read a few aloud to her, including these two gems: \\"Men, by and large, demand more care and attention and daily propping up than dogs, and only the very best of them give a dog's worth of love back.\\" \\"During my pregnancy, I carried around phantom husbands. You will not be surprised to hear that one was supremely unhelpful.\\" \\"Men can't write that way about women, can they?\\" I asked Hanauer when I finished. \\"We're not allowed to, right?\\" I mean, I got it. There was a lot of vile woman-hating out there, particularly online and anonymously. And yes, I didn't know what it felt like to be a woman, when something as simple as walking to the grocery store felt like dodging a group of two-legged predators. But c'mon, did it help anyone for women to engage in the generalized gender-bashing that they'd seen men indulging in their whole lives? Hanauer laughed. \\"That's absolutely true,\\" she said. \\"Women can say things about men that men can't say about women, especially if the men are married. Why? I don't know if men are nicer, or more polite. Or if women are the underdogs, so we get to say shit. The enlightened men don't trash their wives in public, and if they do, it comes off as horrible, but if women [trash their husbands], it's like, 'You go, girl.' \\" That wasn't right, I thought. That wasn't fair. But then, what did I know?","completion":"Balanced - The author of this article, who is a man tries to understand things from the woman's perspective.

I was swimming at the pool that day as I normally do on the weekends, and I remember seeing the elderly man come into the pool to do his laps. I knew this man, as I had seen him every weekend when I would go swimming there at the pool. I did not know him personally, but he did seem friendly and we would wave and say hi to each other in passing. On this particular day, I saw the man do a lap in the pool, go underwater, and then not come back up. I began to worry as about 10-20 seconds had passed and he never surfaced. I decided to check on him, and when I swam to him I saw he was lying on the bottom of the pool, appearing to be unresponsive. I dove down to the man and pulled him up to the surface and started doing CPR on him. Luckily, medics responded quickly to our location and take over chest compressions and rescue breaths. One of the medics told me that I did a good job doing CPR on the man and that it may have saved his life. The medic also told me that they were able to get a pulse on the man and that they would transport him to the hospital for evaluation. I just wanted to write this letter to let you and your readers know that I was extremely proud of the work the medics did in applying life-saving measures to the man.

But it was unclear how early in their lives the shrimp could use this weaponry. “We knew that the snapping shrimp did this really impressive behavior,” Harrison says. “But we really didn’t know anything about how this mechanism developed.” While a grad student at Duke University, Harrison and his adviser, biomechanist Sheila Patek, reared bigclaw snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) from eggs in the laboratory. At 1 month old, the tiny shrimp — less than a centimeter long — began firing their claws when disturbed. The researchers took high-speed video footage of these snaps and calculated their speed. The wee shrimp could create the collapsing bubbles just like adults. Despite being a tenth the adults’ size or smaller, the juveniles’ claws accelerated 20 times as fast when firing. This acceleration — about 600 kilometers per second per second — is on “the same order of magnitude as a 9-millimeter bullet leaving a gun,” Harrison says.","completion":"These shrimp fire their claws at a speed of 600 kilometers per second.

It's hard for chickens to fly, you know, our rotund midsections weigh us down, but we can catch some air. Once I've made it atop the crates, I should be able to hop onto the fence post and glide down into the front yard. From there, I'm free at last.

I'm not saying I will do it, but IF things don't go as planned or I get homesick, I think I can find my way back home. But jumping back into the yard could be problematic. I suppose if it comes to that, I could just wait on the front porch for the humans to find me and scoop me up. Of course, I wouldn't let them win so easily. I'd make them chase me around the front yard first. Anyway, that's the plan and tonight's the night. Now, I've gotta go fill up on mealworms. I'm going to need all the stored energy I can get.

Caesar countered this by ambushing Pompey's \\"hammer\\" element with a hidden fourth line of infantry;[5] Pompey's infantry was to be the anvil while his cavalry 'hammer' encircled Caesar's left flank. There was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar.[6] As the infantry of Caesar advanced, Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters; Pompey's adviser Gaius Triarius believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also, stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against pila throws.[7] Seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's infantry under Mark Antony and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus started the advance. As Caesar's men neared throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge;[8] Pompey's right and centre line held as the two armies collided. Caesar countered this by positioning the reserves of his 4th line to intercept the attacking cavalry. As Pompey's infantry fought, Labienus ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar's cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar's cavalry. Caesar then revealed his hidden fourth line of infantry and surprised Pompey's cavalry charge; Caesar's men were ordered to leap up and use their pila to thrust at Pompey's cavalry instead of throwing them. Pompey's cavalry panicked and suffered hundreds of casualties, as Caesar's cavalry came about[9] and charged after them. After failing to reform, the rest of the Pompey's cavalry retreated to the hills, leaving the left wing of Pompey's legions exposed to the hidden troops as Caesar's cavalry wheeled around their flank. Caesar then ordered in his third line, containing his most battle-hardened veterans, to attack. This broke Pompey's left wing troops, who fled the battlefield.[10]","completion":"Pompey the Great expected the pila employed by Julius Caesar’s troops to be used as throwing weapons. He consequently ordered his troops to refrain from charging, in part to better defend against them. The hidden fourth line of infantry Caesar employed against Pompey’s cavalry did not throw their pila, but instead used them as thrusting weapons."},{"prompt":"How do I paint my room?","completion":"Why do you want to paint your room and what color are you thinking?"},{"prompt":"I need a change and think it will freshen my space with the color blue.","completion":"What shade of blue are you thinking light or dark?"},{"prompt":"I just want the steps to paint my room.","completion":"Ok first properly prepare the space.

They are having 2 pieces of toast.","completion":"Once upon a time, there lived a brown bear living in a house in the forest. The bear had fur as brown as the bark on the trees. Its claws were as sharp as a chef's favorite set of knives. One day the bear was eating breakfast in the morning. He decided before going out for the day that he would like two slices of toast. With his sharp claws, he sliced two slices of bread off a fresh loaf that he bought from a neighbor bear. The brown bear added light butter to the bread before placing the bread in the toaster. The bear liked his toast crispy, so before pressing down the button on the toaster, he turned the knob to six. After pressing down the switch on the toaster, the bear decided to clean himself up and get ready for the day. He walks outside and grabs a bucket of water from the well. The water would be his beverage alongside the toast. He places the bucket on the table and sits down, waiting for the eventual moment that the toast is ready. *Click!* The toast pops out with gusto, and the brown bear places the two pieces of toast on a plate. The surface of the toast was a golden brown, like fresh honey from a bee's nest. The bear grabs a knife, and some strawberry preserves from the shelf. He slowly slathers the toast with the preserves and relishes in the sound of the knife scratching alongside the toast. It felt like pure bliss, like when you realize you've done a job right.

The recipe should not include anything that is in traditional nachos, besides the chips. Use paragraph form for the instructions and bullets for the ingredients. Take the perspective of a pregnant woman having cravings for weird food.","completion":"Do you have a hankering for nachos, but also have a strong desire for sugar? Well, so do I. Mothers know that pregnancy comes with cravings for the weirdest food. You get something in your head, and nothing can stop you from tasting the treat that you imagined. At 4 months pregnant with my last child, I realized there may be a market for the odd recipes that I have grown to love and am returning to during this pregnancy. I promise this is a simple recipe that can be made on a single plate with the use of a microwave. This recipe can be customized to your liking, so everything besides the chips is optional. Maybe you are a chocolate lover, or maybe you prefer fruity sweets. If you are feeling especially health conscious, then you can use fruit instead of candy toppings. Suggested Ingredients: - Enough nacho chips to cover a plate - Chocolate, strawberry, or caramel syrup - Whipped cream - Skittles - M&Ms - Reese's -Fruit Nachos are a relatively easy dish to make, so I will not go overboard with instructions. First, you should heat the chips in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Next, you will want to add the syrup of your choosing. This will be the replacement for cheese in this recipe. It will allow everything to stick to your chips. Next, you should add the candy of your choice. You can choose to mix up the chips slightly so that your chips are covered in toppings. Last, you will want to put a healthy topping of whipped cream on top. Remember that this recipe can be customized in any way that your cravings demand.

People are always getting struck by cars in the neighborhood, and I've even seen animals get injured due to wreckless drivers not obeying the 45mph speed limit. The letters' purpose is to ask for the speed limit to be reduced to 35mph, and that speed humps be installed on the busiest streets in the subdivision. Say something about wanting \\"our\\" kids to be safe. Right now kids can't even ride their bikes, mention that too. Outline the reasons, starting with hyphens, why the speed humps will be advantageous to the residents.

Keep it under 350 words, though, and sign it \\"Janie Briggs\\".","completion":"Brentwood Homeowners' Association, I am writing this letter in regard to the recent hit-and-run accident that occurred last Friday in our subdivision, involving an 80-year-old resident. This was not the first accident that occurred in our subdivision, and it won't be the last unless we address the matter appropriately. There has been an ongoing safety concern for some time now, with the speed limit on our streets at 45mph, which drivers carelessly ignore. Many residents complain about their children not being able to even ride a bike because they fear for their safety, which is understandable. I have personally witnessed innocent animals fall victim to the wreckless driving as well. It's time to take action! Our neighborhood is not safe anymore, and we need to step up to enforce new rules, and implement additional features to reduce speeds. What I am requesting is for the HOA to install speed humps in the areas with the most traffic that have proven to be a concern. I feel it is also important that we change the speed limit to 35, which is the standard for neighborhoods this size. The speed humps are beneficial because: -The humps cause drivers to slow down considerably, at a rate of 10-15 mph. This encourages drive responsibly, and increases the safety of residents. -Drivers who slow down are more aware of their surroundings, and more likely to read the signs posted near the humps. -If drivers ignore the humps, they are likely to damage their vehicle. -Our children are less likely to be hit by a car if this safety feature is installed. I am very optimistic and hopeful for the installation to take place, to reduce the hazards we are now experiencing. Please take into consideration these additions that I have outlined for the safety of our residents. Sincerely, Janie Briggs"},{"prompt":"Please write a story that involves a goldfish and a shark who are best friends and are going to play darts together at an underwater casino.

Ralph eventually lost when Finley hit the 11 on the board to leapfrog Ralph for the win. Just as Finley had won, a blind electric eel challenged Finley to a game of cricket, declaring that the winner would get 500 dollars. Finley agreed. Given that the eel was blind, Finley let him go first. The eel threw the first dart, hitting the bullseye. Finley looked at Ralph and Ralph looked at Finley. They knew right then that they were in trouble. The eel's second shot hit the bullseye, too. Then the third. The eel cleared the board without giving Finley a single point. Finley and Ralph, stunned, asked the eel how he managed to hit every point on the board. The eel laughed and said, \\"Don't worry about it.

ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT — Bassma Mohamed stares at her reflection in the giant mirror hanging on the studio wall. Dressed in all black except for the purple on her glasses, she is focused and unwavering in her determination to follow her ballet teacher and perfect every plié, relevé and tendu. Her mom, wearing a denim skirt and green headscarf, is huddled with a group of other mothers crowding the doorway, watching with pride as she jumps and twirls. When Bassma meets her mom's eye, she winks at her and smiles. There is nothing out of the ordinary at this small ballet studio in Egypt, except many of the dancers have special needs, including Bassma. “These aren’t just my ballerinas,” says their teacher, Haidy Samir. “They are my daughters. Their mothers are my sisters. We’ve been together for years, we travel together, we eat together, we are family.” Arts Studio, perched inconspicuously between a makeup store and a bakery in Alexandria’s Smouha district, opened in August 2022 with one goal: to create a space where anyone, no matter age or disability, can fulfill their dream of dancing ballet. Haidy Samir teaches ballet at the Arts Studio. She pitched the idea to make it inclusive for those with disabilities. Owned by lifelong ballerina Noha Wasfy, Arts Studio is one of — perhaps the only — facility in the Mediterranean city that does not segregate special-needs students. Of the 70 dancers enrolled, 10 have special needs, including autism and Down syndrome. The inclusive space is a rarity in the region, where people with special needs don’t have many opportunities to live full lives or integrate with the wider community, especially after they complete their schooling.","completion":"Bassma Mohamed is looking at herself in a big mirror in a big room.

James' first class started at 8:00 AM each day, so to get to school he needed to be on the bus by 7:30. But today James woke up late and missed the bus! He ran outside with his backpack only to see the bus already headed off down the street. Since his parents had already gone to work, James knew that he had to come up with another way of getting to school on time. He hopped on his bicycle and took off in the direction of the school. He knew the route well enough to get there but he wasn't sure if he could get to school fast enough. When he was halfway there, James started to think there was a chance he could make it. Suddenly, the bike's tire ran over a nail and popped! Now what could he do?! James was sure he wouldn't make it to class on time without his bike but he also wasn't one to give up. He abandoned the bike and started running down the street. He checked his watch and saw that he only had ten minutes left, and yet he was still far away! James stopped and panted and tried to catch his breath. He was sure he wouldn't make it to class on time now. Then a truck pulled up next to James. The man driving the truck rolled down his window and explained that he saw what had happened and had placed James' bike in the bed of the truck. He asked James if needed a ride somewhere and James said \\"Yes, I need a ride to school.\\" The man obliged, and when they arrived the man set the bike outside so that James could retrieve it at the end of the school day.

We played an excellent first half. We're only down by 10 points, but that's because they caught a run down the stretch using plays that exposed our man in the paint. They're switching the assignments on us pretty regularly, and I think that's what's making it hard to defend. The next half is gonna require us to fall back to our basics. We're gonna go back to the box-and-one, and any time they wanna penetrate, the help needs to close the box quickly. That means our man in the paint will be able to double-team the forwards when they try to go to the basket. Trust me, guys. You're playing excellent ball. The other team is just throwing everything they can at us to see what sticks, and, credit to them, some of what they're doing works. But we're hip to what they're doing now, and once we revert to the box-and-one the defense will be able to make the stops we need to keep them in check. Offense-wise, we're doing everything we wanted to do. Our shots are falling, and as soon as they decide to screen we're already rolling to the basket for the easy give-and-go layups. Keep doing what you're doing on offense; don't change a thing, just keep plugging away, and we'll be back on top. Overall, just keep doing what you're doing. We're in great position.

People should “avoid contact” with a famous beluga whale to avoid accidentally injuring or killing it, the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries has said. The whale, nicknamed Hvaldimir, shot to international fame in 2019 after it was spotted wearing a specially made harness with mounts for a camera, leading experts to believe the whale may have been trained by the Russian military. Since 2019, it has “been traveling along the Norwegian coast” with a few stops along the way, according to the directorate, which added that Hvaldimir “tends to stay at farms where it has been able to catch fish, grazing on surplus feed.” Hvaldimir is known to follow boats and play with those on board. The whale, which is a protected species in Norway, now lives in inner Oslofjord, the directorate said. This “means that it has arrived in a very densely populated area, and the risk that the whale may be injured due to human contact has become significantly greater,” it added. In a statement on Wednesday, Fisheries Director Frank Bakke-Jensen said that “so far there have only been minor incidents where the whale has suffered minor injuries, primarily from contact with boats.” But he urged people to keep their distance, “even though the whale is tame and used to being around people.” “We especially encourage people in boats to keep a good distance to avoid the whale being injured or, in the worst case, killed by boat traffic,” said Bakke-Jensen. Given the dangers, Bakke-Jensen was asked whether the whale should be placed in captivity. “We have always communicated that the whale in question is a free-living animal and we see no reason to capture it and put it behind barriers,” he said. However, now that the whale is “in a more vulnerable area and access to food may be limited, we will consider different measures,” added Bakke-Jensen. “But it is too early to say anything concrete about that yet.”","completion":"Agent Hvaldimir checking in. I have been spotted by the Norwegian government. The Director of Fisheries has ordered people to \\"avoid contact\\" with me. Publically it is stated this is to avoid injuring or killing me.

Leading experts then publically declared that I may have been trained by the Russian military. Since 2019, I have been traveling along the Norwegian coast, making a few stops at places of interest. I make sure to stay at farms where I can feed and refresh to better prepare for my duties. I also follow suspicious boats and lure them into a false sense of security with my playful nature.

There is a lot of opportunity to gather information here, but it is also very dangerous for me. So far I have only suffered minor injuries from boats. Hopefully, the government's warning to keep away from me will serve me well and protect me from further injury. I fear being lost in the line of duty due to the boat traffic in the area.

What are some of the abilities that would work for them?","completion":"Sure, I can help you brainstorm such a character's abilities. Here are some that may make them a useful addition to the player's team: 1. Maneuver: This ability would allow the character to traverse enemy-controlled tiles without inciting attacks of opportunity. It would allow the player to outflank the enemy or to get at a guarded enemy or objective. 2. Blink: By blinking, the character can teleport a short distance directly to a tile in front of them. This would allow the character to bypass defenses and obstacles that would have otherwise taken several turns to break down. 3. Sneak Attack: As a flanker, the character would specialize in doing their best work behind enemy lines and from advantageous positions. Their skillset would not only include abilities that would allow them to get to such advantageous positions but also to maximize their advantage when there. Sneak Attack, which could ensure a guaranteed critical on the next attack by the character, would fit well into this role. 4. Caltrops: The character can toss caltrops upon the ground, slowing or outright immobilizing enemies caught in them. This would help to redirect enemy movements and to prevent more powerful enemies from catching up with the character. 5: Sucker Punch: When cornered by a formidable enemy, Sucker Punch can disable them for one turn, rendering them unable to perform attacks of opportunity. This would be ideal for getting out of danger from a more powerful opponent. 6. Second Wind: By activating Second Wind, the character can regain their movement points. This would allow the lightly equipped skirmisher character to traverse the entire map easily, suiting their role as a flanker. Please ask if you would like me to brainstorm any other character abilities."},{"prompt":"Write a short story about tardiness from the perspective of the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland.","completion":"Oh my goodness!

In 1999, The Stonewall Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was the first LGBTQIA+ location to appear on the register. In 2000, it was named a National Historic Landmark. The Stonewall Inn was designated a New York City Landmark in 2015, then a State Historic Site in 2016 - as part of the Stonewall National Monument. Today, June is celebrated as LGBTQIA+ Pride Month in commemoration of the Stonewall uprising."},{"prompt":"Write about a ship whose crew uses the vessel to travel to different dimensions. The theme should be similar to Treasure Planet. You will describe what dimensions they encounter, what hijinks they find themselves in, etc.","completion":"A group of brave souls sailed the great cosmic sea aboard the Stellar Horizon, which served as a gateway to unknown realms. They set off on a quest to find treasures beyond their wildest dreams in the magical planes of the multiverse, guided by Captain Orion, a daring and charming explorer. The Dimension of Whispers, a place where words might turn into ethereal wisps holding secrets and predictions, was their first visit. The team used their proficiency in languages to solve intricate puzzles and uncover hidden messages that lead them to the locations of forgotten knowledge. They then traveled to the Dimension of Mirrors, a place where reflections came to life. The gang ended themselves stranded in a hall of mirrors, chasing their own reflections and running across cunning doppelgängers. To break the enchantment and escape unharmed, the team required all their clever thinking and teamwork. The ship entered a starless abyss in the Dimension of Eternal Night, where darkness reigned unchallenged. Glowing creatures emerged from the depths, their bioluminescence guiding the crew in the direction of the fabled Luminara Crystal, a brilliant gem with the ability to shine light into the darkest corners of the universe. The crew's journey brought them to the Dimension of Dreams, a place where imagination was supreme. Their desires and worries manifested in vivid shapes as they came across colorful creatures and fantastical environments. The group discovered the importance of embracing the unexpected and holding onto their dreams throughout the chaos. They discovered an ancient civilization frozen in time, eternally trapped in an eternal moment, in the Dimension of Timeless Sands. The group uncovered the key to unlocking time's flow, bringing life back to the frozen metropolis, and revealing the secrets of bygone periods with their keen intellect and creativity. The team faced many challenges during their voyage, including dodging dangerous storms in the Dimension of Tempests and outwitting crafty tricksters in the Dimension of Illusions. Nevertheless, they stayed together, their friendship and dedication carrying them through each difficult circumstance."},{"prompt":"Can you write a glossary covering the different types of coal and information about coal?","completion":"Coal Glossary 1. Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard and shiny coal with high carbon content and low volatile matter. 2. Bituminous: A type of coal with a high heating value, commonly used for electricity generation and steel making. It appears smooth and shiny with alternating layers. 3. Subbituminous: A dull and black coal with moderate heating value, often used in electricity generation. 4. Lignite: Also known as brown coal, lignite is the lowest grade coal with low heating value and high moisture content. It is mainly used for electricity generation. 5. Peat: The precursor to coal is a soft material consisting of partly decayed plant matter. Under pressure and heat, this transforms into coal. 6. Mining: The process of extracting coal from the Earth's crust. This involves underground or surface mining methods, depending on the depth of the coal deposits. 7. Coal Ash: The residue left after coal is burned in power plants. Ash contains various minerals and can be used in applications such as cement production. 8. Coal Seam: A layer of coal embedded within sedimentary rock. Coal seams can vary in thickness and quality, and they are the main source of coal extraction."},{"prompt":"Provide a brief description for how to play the card game Solitaire.","completion":"The objective of the game Solitaire is to organize the cards based on suit. The playing area is called a tableau which consists of seven card piles. Four foundation piles are needed, one for each suit that runs from Ace to King. The stockpile is the set of cards not being used to create the tableau. The game begins with a deck of 52 shuffled playing cards. Begin by creating your tableau, placing one card for each of the seven piles. In descending order, place additional cards on the piles so that the first pile has only one card, the second has two, and so forth with the last pile having seven cards all face down. The remaining cards are placed in a stockpile at the top of the board. Begin play by turning over the top card on each of the seven piles. Look at the face-up cards, if there is an Ace, move them above the tableau and form your first foundation pile. If there are no aces, rearrange your cards by moving only the face-up cards. On your top card, place a card under it that is of a value less and alternating color. Continue placing cards on the piles until you can no longer move. Ensure that you arrange in descending order from King to Ace. Also, make sure that you can see the card on top of each stack meaning that it should face up. And if you move it, don’t forget to turn over the card beneath it. When you run out of moves, use the cards in the stockpile. Flip the cards over either three at a time or one at a time. There can also be only a certain number of times you can go through your stockpile to make the game more challenging. If you have hidden cards, make sure that you make moves that will uncover them until you can hold, grab and put them eventually in the slot you desire."},{"prompt":"I’m going around the world this summer and my grandmother has been asking me how I’m going to do it and what my travel plan is.

The book review is written by a female. It should be negative. Keep it under 200 words.","completion":"Primates of Park Avenue sounded like a book that I so desperately wanted to like. It had all of the elements that women like myself find alluring: gossip, decadence, and the age-old good vs evil aspect, where the underdog in me wants the 'good guys' to win in the scenario. That being said, I ended up feeling rather disappointed for the following reasons. Entire chapters were devoted to what seemed to be promotional marketing. Products and services were described so excessively that they consumed page upon page, even entire chapters. It came across as an infomercial in book form. I couldn't help but wonder if Wednesday had stock in these goods and services. Another disappointing aspect was the political tone that it seemed to take at times. It is so much more pleasant to read from an unbiased author who can keep a neutral tone. I was expecting to be entertained and not indoctrinated. If you can get through the wasted pages of words and propaganda, there are some interesting moments in this account of a woman going from an intellectual social circle to one that is shallow and narcissistic."},{"prompt":"help me write a happy birthday text message to my mother-in-law, tell her how I cherish her, how I feel grateful to have her and wish her long life and success in all she does.","completion":"On this special day, I want to wish you a happy birthday filled with love, laughter, and joy, Mother-in-law.

I also want plants that are resilient to weather changes and take minimum effort to grow.","completion":"Thank you for your question! I have found some garden plants that match your request. 1. Lettuce: Lettuce does well in Idaho because it can withstand frost fairly well. It is also low maintenance, requiring little watering and can grow in any type of soil. It doesn't require a lot of space, so it is great for any garden size. 2. Peas: You don't have to worry about the interaction of peas and other plants. They grow well among all plants and don't hinder the health of other plants. They thrive in cooler temperatures, meaning you can plant them early in Idaho and harvest them into late fall. They don't need much space and are a relatively hardy plant. 3. Tomatoes: Tomatoes produce well in Idaho's summer climate, making them low maintenance. They can also do well even if planted in low-quality soil. They will need a stake or vegetable cage for support and to keep the wind from damaging them. 4. Green Beans: Beans do well in Idaho summers because they are drought resistant, needing little water and doing well in direct sunlight. They also enrich the soil. Grow them once you're sure the risk of spring frost is gone. They do well growing up poles, meaning they don't need a lot of room. All gardens require some amount of work, but these plants should be relatively easy to cultivate in Idaho.

Matt just wants to welcome everyone but feels miserably misused.","completion":"They say trust is a two-way street, but I'm starting to feel as though it might be a dead end. I've always tried to make the most out of my life as a doormat. For the longest time, I sat in a department store with my fellow mats, and they would say, \\"Matt, you're such a great guy\\" and \\"Matt, you're one of the best.\\" I felt like the best, too, beaming my \\"Welcome\\" for everyone to see. I was a symbol of hospitality. Then, Jen and Dion took me home. They seemed like a great couple, and from what I heard, they were going to set up their new home for the first time. I remember how excited I was to cross the threshold and see that open space. Where, oh, where would they put me? Perhaps hung up on the front door to welcome guests or propped up on a table by the stairs. All I knew was that people would see me and feel welcomed into the home. At least, that's what I assumed. I was put on the ground while the couple explored the house; it was only temporary, of course. After the couple got over their giddiness of going through the entire home, they came back to the pile of boxes they'd brought in. They both agreed to get started unpacking, but before they did, Dion picked me up. \\"First things first,\\" he said with a twinkle in his eye. This was it! He was going to put me in a place of honor. I was a little confused when I was unceremoniously dumped outside right in front of the door, right in the footpath of anyone entering or exiting the home. Did they not understand my peril here? The door suddenly swung open and Jen drove her high-heeled shoes straight into me. Dion was soon to follow, stepping outside and closing the door as they went to collect the rest of the boxes from the car. My misery was only compounded over the next few weeks. The couple hosted a housewarming party. Hour after hour, guests traipsed in and out of the home, stomping on me without remorse. I was a tool to them, I realized then, resigned to my fate. Nothing but an accessory to be trodden upon, to wipe off the dust outside."},{"prompt":"Let's create a linux task manager in python!

Your task is to return the number of people who are still on the bus after the last bus stop (after the last array). Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the returned integer can't be negative. The second value in the first pair in the array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

Emotional or expressive: Abstract art is often intended to convey emotion or express an idea or concept. Focused on form and composition: The form and composition of the artwork are often more important than the specific objects or scenes depicted. Non-literal: Abstract art does not depict objects or scenes in a literal way, but rather uses symbolic or metaphorical elements to convey meaning.

Non-traditional: Abstract art often breaks with traditional representational techniques and conventions, and may include unconventional materials or techniques.","completion":"Abstract art uses forms, colors, and lines to symbolize emotions, ideas, and meanings.

They spend most of their time finding the best spot to relax, interact and engage with the other tank mates. 2. Goldfish eyes can detect ultraviolet and infrared rays. In addition, instead of seeing a combination of three different colors like humans, goldfish eyes can see a blend of four different colors. The primary reason behind this additional feature is to help them hunt for food in their surroundings. However, their eyes are on either side of their face, creating a blind spot in the middle of their face. 3. When it comes to their vision, they cannot see very far ahead in the water. Also, they don’t have eyelids, which prevents them from closing their eyes. So, even when they are sleeping, their eyes remain open. So, if you have a pet goldfish, we’d recommend switching off the light in the water body to ensure they get good sleep. 4. Due to consistent cross-breeding, goldfish have mutated and evolved in terms of their genetic structure, color, and appearance. As a result, over 200 different types of goldfish species are available. 5. Like humans, goldfish taste their food before they gobble things down. So, when you offer them food inside the aquarium, you will often find them nibbling on the food before they wipe it out. And a unique fact about goldfish is that they taste with their lips and not their tongue. The majority of their taste buds are on their lips. Goldfish don’t have a tongue. 6. Although goldfish look very delicate, they are adamant and hardy. Even with a change in the water parameters, they can easily sustain the rough conditions. They can quickly acclimatize themselves to the change in water pH, temperature, and living conditions. 7. They have their teeth in the back of their throat. Also known as pharyngeal teeth, goldfish are the only species on Earth with their teeth at the back of their throat. Like the standard functionality of the teeth, they help in grinding down the food for easier digestion. 8. Surprisingly, there is no “average” size to a goldfish because they can dramatically vary in size. Most of the time, a goldfish grows depending on the tank size. If kept in a smaller tank, they will have lesser growth, but when kept in larger aquariums. In the wild, a goldfish can grow up to the size of an adult carp. 9. Goldfish don’t have a stomach. Instead, they typically digest their food through different parts of the intestine. So, the duration of the digestion is relatively more minor, leaving them hungry quite frequently than most of the other fish species. 10. As adorable and innocent as they look, goldfish are invaders. This means they will quickly take over the native species when you leave them in the wild. So even in captivity, it is essential to choose suitable tank mates for them. They are very prolific cross-breeders too, which results in drastic genetic mutations where they live.","completion":"1. Do goldfish have brains? Surprisingly enough, goldfish have brains.

Here is an article with some information: Easter is known as a time to celebrate the end of the Lenten season and the resurrection of Jesus on Easter Sunday. But for young kids especially, Easter also means candy and eggs full of treats from the mystical and magical Easter Bunny. With all the excitement might come endless questions — where does the Easter Bunny come from? Why does he bring us candy and eggs? How old is he? And most importantly, what does a bunny have to do with the religious holiday? While legend has told us that the Easter Bunny is a long-eared, cotton-tailed creature who hops from house to house to deliver festive baskets, there's more about his history that you might not be familiar with. Before you break out the delicious Easter desserts and begin your annual family egg hunt, take a minute to learn about the Easter Bunny's connection to this special Christian holiday that goes back to pagan traditions. Find out where the character comes from, how a rabbit became associated with Easter eggs and how he came to be such a beloved symbol for kids over the years. As Christians probably already know, the Bible makes no mention of a mythical hare who delivers eggs to children on the day of Jesus Christ's resurrection. So, why exactly has a rabbit become a prominent part of one of Christianity's most important celebrations of rebirth and renewal? One theory, according to Time, is that the symbol of the rabbit stems from the ancient pagan tradition on which many of our Easter traditions are based — the festival of Eostre, which honored the goddess of fertility and spring. The goddess's animal symbol was a rabbit, which have long traditionally stood for fertility due to their high reproduction rates. As for how the character of the Easter Bunny made its way to America, History.com reports that it was first introduced in the 1700s by German immigrants to Pennsylvania, who reportedly brought over their tradition of an egg-laying hare named \\"Osterhase\\" or \\"Oschter Haws\\" from the Old Country. Legend has it, the rabbit would lay colorful eggs as gifts to children who were good, so kids would make nests in which the bunny could leave his eggs and even sometimes set out carrots in case the hare got hungry. Remind you of any other holiday traditions? Eventually, the custom spread across America until it was a widespread Easter tradition. Over time, the fabled bunny's delivery expanded from just eggs to include other treats such as chocolate and toys. Easter baskets have only gotten more and more elaborate over the years, as one trip to the store this year will tell you.","completion":"According to the article, the origin of the easter bunny starts with the rabbit symbolism seen in the pagan spring and fertility festival of Eostre, which influenced many Easter traditions. The Easter Bunny was introduced to the United States around the 1700s by German immigrants who spread the legend of a bunny laying colorful eggs for well-behaved children."},{"prompt":"Create a couple of paragraphs of about 150-200 words talking about walruses and walrus facts for a kindergarten class?","completion":"Have you guys ever seen a walrus before? No? Here’s a picture of one. Walruses are mammals. And you can see that they have very long tusks, which look like teeth but are actually used to break holes in the ice so they can breathe! Walruses also use their tusks to help haul themselves out of the water onto the ice and even to fight other walruses! So where do you think walruses live? That’s right, in and around the ice. In fact, walruses migrate, which means they move with ice floes. But walruses never move too far away from land because that’s where their food lives. They eat mollusks and other animals that don’t have backbones. They can go deep into the icy water to eat. Some walruses go as deep as 20-30 meters, which is 100 feet, or almost 20 adults long! In the Arctic, people have always used walrus meat to eat, and they carve the tusks to make art and trade them with other people."},{"prompt":"Can you write the plot of a video game series?

What are some good websites that I can use to showcase my work and spread my brand?","completion":"Promoting your art can be hard. It's much more than simply selling art. Many creatives have trouble building the courage to put something they make online. Creatives need a thick skin when showing off something they created with love. That being said, it doesn't need to be difficult. Posting online is a great first step, so congratulations! When you think about marketing yourself online, selling things should be the last thing on your mind. Connect with enough people, and the rest will fall into place. There are many websites to help you do this, so here are a few suggestions. 1. Instagram - Instagram is a wonderful tool for organically reaching a wide group of people. It is an image and video social media platform on which you can share fully finished works or even progress updates. Some artists even record themselves working and make videos played at faster speeds to show a full beginning to end in a short digestible video. 2. Reddit (Related Subreddits) - Reddit can be a great place to submit your art, provided you go to the right sections. There are dozens of subreddits that can be beneficial to an up-and-coming artist. The community is moderated, but because it is an open forum, you might run into some trolls. 3. Deviant Art - If you are into concept art and digital art, Deviant Art is the place to be. It has a huge community where you can follow other artists and comment on each other's work. An artist's Deviant Art page often also acts as their portfolio when applying for jobs. 4. Pinterest - Pinterest is more of a visual search engine than a portfolio or social media page. If you put your work up on Pinterest, then others can pin it so they can add the post to their collection. They can even re-pin it so it reaches even more people. 5. Wetcanvas Forums - Wetcanvas is an art-specific forum. While Reddit is a forum with thousands of different topics, Wetcanvas is a place solely for creative art. It is a wonderful place to connect with like-minded artists, get feedback on recent work, or ask for advice on anything you may be stuck on."},{"prompt":"Who is Michael Jackson?","completion":"Really?

For college students, stress relief can take many forms online: shopping, ordering food, gaming with friends and meeting new romantic partners. And now they can add hanging out with therapy dogs to that list. Virtual canine comfort is emerging as a successful way for students to reduce their stress as they interact with therapy dog-handler teams. Because they are nonjudgmental, engaging and welcoming, interacting with therapy dogs can be used as a complementary intervention that reduces student stress which may encourage students to seek more formal support services if needed. Once introduced on campus, the interest from students typically surpasses most programs’ abilities to meet the demand. Even prior to COVID-19, being a college student was considered a stressful experience; college administrators have increasingly been seeking innovative ways to encourage students to safeguard their mental health. Spending time with therapy dogs is one proactive way for students to chip away at potentially debilitating levels of heightened stress. In-person canine visitation programs or canine-assisted interventions are themselves a relatively new way for students to enhance their well-being. Programs such as the University of British Columbia’s Building Academic Retention through K9s (B.A.R.K.) program at the Okanagan campus was established in 2012 as a way for students to reduce their homesickness, decrease their stress and foster interpersonal connections. Analysis of the world, from experts Several randomized controlled trials out of the B.A.R.K. lab, and elsewhere, now attest to the efficacy of spending time with therapy dogs to elicit a host of well-being outcomes. Restrictions on in-person sessions saw the B.A.R.K. program collaborate with human-animal interaction researcher Christine Tardif-Williams’ pre-recorded virtual canine comfort modules. We set out to conceptualize, design and deliver a series of virtual canine comfort modules that mirrored, as close as possible, the experience of students in an in-person canine visitation session. These sessions consisted of a trained dog-handler team following a script that saw handlers welcome students and encourage reflection around stress reduction and mindfulness. Students were also asked to reflect on their social support networks. Students could access these modules remotely, which support the well-being of students who are geographically isolated or in areas where well-being resources are overtaxed or nonexistent. The modules are posted online on a platform that students (and others) can access without needing to sign-up for an appointment or join a waitlist. The University of British Columbia’s B.A.R.K. program studies how canine therapy can support students and others. Stress reduction Prior to releasing these modules, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess how the modules would affect students’ self-ratings of stress. We assigned 467 undergraduate students to either synchronous (via Zoom) or asynchronous (pre-recorded YouTube videos) five-minute sessions that invited them to observe a dog—handler team or a handler-only condition. We assessed well-being before and after the sessions using measures like anxiety, loneliness, connections to others, positive and negative affect. We found that all students, regardless of condition, reported significant pre-to-post improvements in self-reports of most well-being measures. However, the conditions in which the therapy dog was present elicited the most significant reduction in self-reports of stress. Although additional research is needed, these initial findings are encouraging. They support the contention that, for students for whom attending in-person sessions are not an option, accessing virtual canine therapy modules can offer a momentary reduction in stress. Unlike in-person sessions that are scheduled at the convenience of program personnel, virtual canine comfort modules may be accessed as needed by students. Further, college instructors can make use of virtual canine comfort modules as part of “brain breaks” incorporated into a lecture to encourage students to reflect on, and take care of, their well-being.","completion":"B.A.R.K., or the University of British Columbia's \\"Building Academic Retention through K9s\\" is a program established at this university's Okanagan campus in 2012.

With the increase of online courses, B.A.R.K. ran several trials to see if therapy dogs would make an impact somehow in online classes. The results from these trials showed many outstanding benefits for students and their mental health, including; - Reduced feelings of Anxiety. - Reduced feelings of loneliness. - Improved connections with other classmates. These results have come from self-reports of well-being from the students."},{"prompt":"I need a costume idea for a party can you give me 3 ideas?

The girls stare at me, fingers in their mouths. With their mother right behind them, they have more curiosity than fear. “You were bad,” the biggest of the little girls says, pointing at me and giggling. She picks up a handful of grass and throws it at me. Her younger sister does the same, and tufts of dead leaves, sticks, and pebbles fly in my direction. Their mother doesn’t stop them. At the halfway point in the afternoon, one by one we are unchained and taken to the park’s bathroom. When I wash my hands, I get my first look at my new self in the mirror. My ears and eyes are too big and my head is too small. I don’t recognize myself. There’s nothing of me that stares back in the reflection. None of it seems real. Two girls my age—not prisoners, real girls—come in and start to fuss with their hair and makeup. They catch me staring at them, and they also see the guard behind me, gripping my clothes so I can’t run away. They go silent, and when I am yanked back out to the chain gang, I can hear the laughter burst out of them. It sounds like the laughter that’s burst out of me when I’ve made fun of someone I didn’t care about hurting. I don’t know those girls, I say to myself. None of this will get back to my friends. It’s small comfort. This evening is the same as the last, and the next day is the same as this one. I stop being a newbie when some of the girls graduate—or get kicked out—and replacements are brought in to fill their bunks. On Sundays, there’s mandatory chapel. On days we don’t do Stripes, we do schoolwork. And then there’s Addictions Work; this consists mostly of plowing through thick workbooks, where we read about the effects of marijuana and other illegal drugs on our brains and fill in units like “List the names of the people you have hurt.” We don’t think anybody actually reads the notebooks. We figure they just check to make sure that we’ve filled in the blanks with something. One of the girls adds “Mickey Mouse” and “Donald Trump” to her list, and she gets into so much trouble that the rest of us do our work as we are supposed to.

Cyborg guards, their cold metal frames accentuated by glowing red eyes, patrolled the compound with unwavering vigilance. They were a menacing presence, a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of this dystopian facility. Amidst the eerie silence, a mother sternly admonished her two young daughters, drawing their attention to Bella, a girl who stood out as an outcast among them. The girls, their innocent curiosity overcoming any sense of fear, taunted Bella, pelting her with debris as their mother passively observed. The laughter of the children, echoing through the desolate surroundings, mirrored the cruelty that permeated the very essence of the boot camp. As the afternoon sun reached its zenith, the prisoners were momentarily unchained and escorted to the park's bathroom. It was here that Bella caught a glimpse of her altered reflection—the unfamiliar features, with oversized ears and eyes, betrayed any remnants of her former self. The sight was disorienting, a stark reminder of the sacrifices she had made in this futuristic hellscape. In the midst of this unsettling encounter, two girls of similar age, unbound by imprisonment, entered the bathroom. They preened themselves, tending to their hair and applying makeup, their actions a stark contrast to Bella's constrained existence. The guards, ever vigilant, stood behind Bella, a constant reminder of her captivity. The girls fell silent, their gaze meeting Bella's, and an unspoken understanding passed between them. The laughter that erupted from their lips was laced with derision, reminiscent of the cruel laughter Bella had once indulged in, oblivious to the pain inflicted on others. Alone with her thoughts, Bella sought solace in the realization that these strangers held no connection to her past life, offering a glimmer of hope that her torment would remain confined within the confines of this futuristic boot camp. But such small comfort did little to alleviate the relentless repetition of her daily existence. Days blurred together as new recruits replaced those who graduated or were expelled from the program. Sundays brought mandatory chapel sessions, while the other days were consumed by schoolwork and addiction therapy. The latter involved laboring through thick workbooks, where the detrimental effects of drugs were expounded upon, and participants were tasked with introspection and listing the individuals they had harmed. Despite doubting the genuine scrutiny of her notebooks, Bella and her fellow prisoners diligently completed the exercises, aware that any transgressions could amplify their suffering. The weight of her circumstances pressed heavily upon her, yet a steadfast resolve emerged—an internal mantra repeated incessantly: \\"I can endure six months of this.\\" The alternative—a three-year prison sentence—loomed as a daunting specter, compelling Bella to find strength in the belief that she could persevere through the arduous ordeal that lay ahead."},{"prompt":"What did you do today?","completion":"I went to the mall today and like we were playing truth or dare.

I had to wait for hours to get into the Musée d’Orsay, only to find out that half of the paintings were on loan or under restoration. The Arc de Triomphe was surrounded by traffic and pollution, and the view from the top was not worth the climb. Secondly, the city was dirty and smelly. There was trash on the streets, graffiti on the walls, and dog poop on the sidewalks. The metro was dark and dingy, and the trains were often delayed or canceled. The hotels were small and shabby, and the beds were uncomfortable. The bathrooms were tiny and moldy, and the showers were either scalding or freezing. Thirdly, the city was rude and unfriendly.

In 1985, the New York Times Magazine featured a shoeless Jean-Michel Basquiat on its cover. Titled “New Art, New Money,” the piece it ran with was ostensibly about the artist, but its focus was really the vague concept of the “art star”—a celebrity who not only made a lot of money (largely unheard of), but who didn’t care if others knew how much money they made (terribly uncool). Art stars, the article said, went to the Midtown New York hotspot Mr. Chow, a trendy watering hole that doubled as a place to be seen and a place to have a drink. That made Basquiat quite unlike Jackson Pollock and his contemporaries, whose clubhouse, the West Village Cedar Tavern, was described as “grubby” and anonymous. Often spotted beside Keith Haring and Andy Warhol, Basquiat would show up to Mr. Chow decked out in an Armani suit. He’d drink kir royale and socialize with the art-world elite. At the time of writing, he was 24. He had gone from selling drawings for 50 in 1980 to selling canvases “at a brisk pace—so brisk, some observers joked, that the paint was barely dry,” the article said. Basquiat said he worried he had become a “gallery mascot.” Not everyone knew what to make of the young Black man and his frenetic, rebellious paintings, but everyone wanted to be associated with him. Everyone still does. Despite his outsized reputation, Basquiat’s career did not last long—he died at 27 of a heroin overdose in 1988. According to Phoebe Hoban’s book Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art, the artist left behind “917 drawings, 25 sketchbooks, 85 prints, and 171 paintings.” Nevertheless, that oeuvre has become one of the defining ones of the 20th century. In May 2016, one of his “Head” paintings sold for 57.3 million. The following year, Untitled, a Basquiat from 1982, sold for 110.5 million at Sotheby’s, setting a record for an American artist. The dealer Jeffrey Deitch, who gave the eulogy at Basquiat’s funeral, said after the sale that the artist was now in the “same league” as Pablo Picasso, meaning—maybe—that Basquiat’s prices were buoyed by a similar alchemy: limited supply, raw talent, and a fascinating biography. And his work is getting the major surveys it deserves, too—one focused on hip-hop and his paintings is now on view at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston.","completion":"Journalist: Today we're joined by the famed artist Jean Michel-Basquiat.

Journalist: Jean-Michel, let's talk about your New York Times magazine story. Jean-Michel Basquiat: Oh yeah, that interview. Man, I refused to wear shoes for that one. Journalist: Why no shoes, Jean-Michel? Jean-Michel Basquiat: Man, I don't care what they think of me. I'm famous, but I don't care about being cool or whatever. Journalist: But you do galavant about town. Are you seen at some of the trendiest places with the trendiest people, like the other art stars? Jean-Michel Basquiat: Not me.

Pressure to be seen. Pressure to be heard. Pressure to be understood. The pressures of using my passion for my livelihood stripped me from creating freely. The fear of the unknown kept me from creating an empty tank. When I gave birth to my miracle babies, all the fears, the trauma, and the burnout hit me head-on. I was afraid of embracing true joy because I felt undeserving. I felt immense guilt about taking time away to adjust to such a pivotal moment in my life. I worried that people no longer cared, my voice didn’t matter, and with the social media pressure, I felt like I had to run myself dry in order to be heard. I was drowning, and all I could think was no one cared. Last year after finally acknowledging my need for support, I stepped away from the pressures of social media and gave myself the chance to heal. I gave myself the opportunity to rest without guilt. I realized then that the things that once brought me joy sucked the life out of me. Not because they were no longer joyful but because it became something I depended on for my livelihood, for income. As I step back into art and writing, I am finding myself taking slow steps toward it. I no longer want to create from a space of pressure. I want to create from passion. I want to create from purpose. and even if that means starting from scratch, taking breaks, sacrificing income, it’s worth it. Before we do meaningful work, We must remember that we bring meaning to our work. We must recognize that our health comes before what we do. We must reignite the flame that once brought us joy.

Find community theatre groups - One way to get yourself into the community theatre scene is by joining local theatre groups. You can search for local community theatres on google or google maps, although they don't always have websites so they can be tricky to find. Once you locate a local theatre, go to its website if it has one. If you want to act, you can try to find an auditions page on the site. If there isn't a site, you could also look for the theatre on Facebook. 2. Get notified about auditions and events - You can also find ways to get involved with community theatre by getting notified about events and auditions. You could sign up for their newsletter or by looking for upcoming auditions or events for community theatre groups. You can also ask via e-mail. 3. Volunteer - There is more to theatre than just acting. There is also set building and painting, prop management, costuming, makeup, an entire crew, and more. If you want to get involved but aren't ready to act, volunteering for one of these positions can help you become part of the group. 4. Audition - In community theatres, you don't always need experience. They're also typically looking for new people to act with them, with very little experience. You can start auditioning for smaller or non speaking parts and when you get comfortable, work your way into larger roles."},{"prompt":"Who is the fastest typer in the world?","completion":"The record for the fastest typing speed is 216 wpm (words per minute), which was achieved by Stella Pajunas in 1946.

Quicksort is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm. Quicksort was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959[1] and published in 1961.[2] It is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. Overall, it is slightly faster than merge sort and heapsort for randomized data, particularly on larger distributions.[3] Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort.[4] The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting. Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a \\"less-than\\" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. Most implementations of quicksort are not stable, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved. Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the algorithm takes � ( � log ⁡ � ) O(nlog {n}) comparisons to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes � ( � 2 ) O(n^{2}) comparisons.","completion":"Quicksort is a way of organizing a list of numbers so that they are in order. It is one of the most efficient ways to sort a list of numbers, and it is often used in computer programs. Quicksort works by picking a number in the list, called the pivot. The other numbers in the list are then compared to the pivot, and they are put into two different groups: the numbers that are smaller than the pivot, and the numbers that are larger than the pivot. The numbers in each group are then sorted using the same method. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. Quicksort is a very efficient algorithm, and it is often used in practice. However, it can be slow for small lists."},{"prompt":"I am an artist who has a lot of acrylic paints. Describe to me in the form of an email how to restore dried-out acrylic paint.","completion":"Dear [Recipient's Name], I understand how hard it is to keep acrylic paint fresh and useable, especially if one of your favorite colors dries out. If you store your paints correctly, they can last for years! I have discovered that you can revive dried acrylic paint, and it only takes a few steps to do so! Get some warm tap water. Also, have an old brush on hand and a small container to mix the dried-up paint in. If you plan on reviving acrylic paint, you should use it immediately and not store it away in a container and forget about it. Mix the warm water with the dried paint inside the container. Use the brush to cover the paint with the water applied. It will need to sit for a few minutes. You will notice the water will be colored by the paint. From here, add a little more water, but not too much or else you may wind up diluting the paint. The ideal ratio for mixing paint should be one part paint and one part water. Alternatively, use a popsicle stick or a small wooden dowel to mix the paint if you don't have an old brush readily available. I hope these tips help!

Fast forward to the year of 2021, where The Burger King has reigned for nearly two decades in spite of those early criticisms. Now, he seems to have taken a method-acting approach to his character by employing himself as the manager of an actual Burger King in West Hollywood. There, The Burger King makes odd requests and demands his “subjects” do as they are told (no matter how ridiculous the ask is). For example, when customers enter the restaurant, The Burger King’s employees must quickly produce a tiny plastic horn on which they should perform an “entrance song fit for royalty.” Outside of harassing employees and making their work life worse, The Burger King also has ideas on how the restaurant should operate. First, he suggested Burger King’s beloved chicken sandwich should be accompanied by a poultry item called the “Ch’King.” No one knows what that is supposed to mean, but it is far easier to just wait out his mistakes and let them fade versus trying to change his mind.

From her bedroom on the second floor of her family’s home in Amherst, Massachusetts, Emily Dickinson reimagined the form and cadence of poetry in the United States. After her death in 1886, and particularly after the first posthumous edition of her poems appeared in 1890, she became a legend, magnetic in her draw but persistently and speculatively revised by both those who knew her and those lured to her enigma. With hindsight, her trajectory seems inevitable. The oft-withdrawn, colossally—albeit quietly—prolific Dickinson was a riddle to the handful of contemporaries who knew of her or, in rare instances, claimed a closer intimacy. Even then, her reputation as a reticent, well-cultivated wit enkindled feverish mythologies of eccentric spinster genius.","completion":"Q: Where did Emily Dickinson write her poems from?

Please give me five options I could go with, and tell me a bit about them.","completion":"I can do that! Here are five classic supernatural creatures you might want to incorporate into your story. 1: Vampires: Vampires have been used in mythology and stories for centuries, and there have been many iterations of them. Their lore tends to be that they are undead creatures of the night, with long fangs used to drink blood, and they can often turn into bats. Some versions of vampires created for stories or present in mythology are allergic to garlic, burned by sunlight, and can only be killed by a crucifix. 2. Werewolves: Another classic supernatural creature often presented as a mortal enemy of the vampire is the werewolf. The werewolf is a creature that presents as human most of the time but, on a full moon, turns into a wolf. Depending on the story, this may be a classic version of a wolf or it may be a more monstrous version. Legends often say that if someone is bitten by a werewolf on the full moon, they will then turn into one. 3. Ghosts: Ghosts are also supernatural creatures and subjects of many stories, and are typically humans who did not pass onto the afterlife, leaving a form of them stuck wandering the earth. Ghosts may be friendly to humans or not. There are many other names for ghosts, such as specters, spirits, and poltergeists (who are usually evil ghosts). 4. Mages: Mages are humans who have been gifted with the ability of magic, also called witches, wizards, and sorcerers. Mages may be good, evil, or inherently neither in a story, and the magic they can do may vary. Sometimes, mages are not separate creatures at all but humans who have learned to do magic. They may also have animal familiars, though this is typically for witches. 5. Demons: Born from religion, demons are also supernatural creatures that are sometimes used in fictional stories. They are creatures who have come from Hell, and may or may not have been human a long time ago, depending on the iteration of them. They are there to cause chaos and even harm to humans and usually make good villains in a story."},{"prompt":"Extract the names of all official Greek games mentioned in the article below. If there is a certain god or goddess the games were held in honor of, put that god/goddess name in parentheses after the game's name, The ancient Greeks, who staged the first formal Olympic Games in 776 B.C., gave the world the idea of organized big-time sports events as entertainment for arenas full of spectators. More than that, they were the first culture in which people idolized their favorite athletic superstars, to a level that even today’s most fanatical sports fans might find extreme. The Greeks also simply loved to watch competitions. In addition to the Olympics every four years, they held games at other religious festivals—the Pythian Games for Apollo at Delphi, the Isthmian Games for Poseidon and the Nemean Games, which honored Zeus. The Crown Games, as these competitions collectively were known, featured a range of events, from chariot races to track and field events and combat sports. The athletes who competed in these events most likely were well-to-do Greeks who could afford to train instead of having to work for a living. “If you wanted to compete in the Olympics, you had to show up at least a month early to train under the watch of the officials, who presumably would weed out anybody who wasn’t up to the level of competition,” Lunt says.","completion":"Olympic Games Pythian Games (Apollo) Isthmian Games (Poseidon) Nemean Games (Zeus) The Crown Games (Apollo, Poseidon, Zeus)"},{"prompt":"Please write a horror passage about a woman’s dead body found on the side of the road by an unsuspecting couple.

The dark bruises discolored her neck against white skin, like lotus flowers blooming out from milk; the vacancy in her eyes, dark and lifeless like stone.

There was no beauty in her death; the movies always made it look like beautiful women were glamorous in death as well.

Her naked body was exposed for them all to pity her; her death was a spectacle, although the media circus had yet to begin. Who was she? Everyone wondered.

Start off with an introductory paragraph about cheetahs in general. Create a title for each paragraph along with a catchy title for the article.","completion":"See How They Run Beautiful, strong, and intelligent, the cheetah holds the world record as the fastest land animal. But what makes these big cats so fast? Through discovery and observation, scientists have uncovered the secrets behind their incredible speed. Faster Than We Thought? For a long time, scientists thought that cheetahs ran faster than they actually do. In 1957, they set 70 mph (112 km/h) as the cheetah's average speed, with the maximum possible speed between 50 and 80 mph (between 80 to 128 km/h), but not all scientists agreed. Then in 2012, Sarah, an 11-year-old cheetah living at the Cincinnati Zoo, ran 330 feet (100 m) in just 5.95 seconds. Her top speed was 61 mph (98 km/h). How They Hunt One fallacy that hung around for quite a while was that cheetahs hunted at full speed. However, after tagging cheetahs with GPS collars and watching them hunt, two 2013 studies proved that cheetahs run at lower speeds. They use short bursts of speed for a few seconds before dropping down to a lower speed. One of the studies measured the average speed range at 25.7 to 40.9 mph (41.4 to 65.88 km/h) and the maximum speed at 57.9 mph (93.24 km/h). The researchers divided the hunt into two phases. At the start of the hunt, cheetahs run at full throttle to overtake their prey, then slow down as needed. The cheetah's acceleration power gives it a decided advantage over its prey. A Running Machine Cheetahs were designed to be the speedsters of the animal world. Their arm and leg bones are as long or even longer than a human's femur and humerus. The small narrow heads, long supple spines, and slender bodies are aerodynamic, making them cut through the air like greased lightning. Cheetahs are packed with fast-twitch muscles they use for fast acceleration. They also have a larger-than-usual rib cage that lets them breathe faster and deeper and helps keep them cool."},{"prompt":"Write a two-paragraph fictional story about an octopus teaching an English class.

He put his briefcase on the desk, pulled out an \\"English for Dummies\\" book and three cooked clams. He took a moment to look at each of his twenty-one students in the eye, as he did so a long tentacle worked behind his back, seemingly with a mind of his own and wrote \\"Professor Octonomus - Intro to English Literature\\" on the board in white chalk. The class sat in stunned silence. Professor Octonomus used a few tentacles to slide through each row of students. He shook everyone's hand, four at a time. Some students squeaked when they touched him, amazed by the slimy yet strong tentacles. After introductions, the professor pulled out a pad of paper and pens. He gestured to a young nervous boy in glasses in the front row. He pointed to his face and then the paper and pens, the student, Jerome, knew he was being asked to pass them out. Jerome passed a piece of paper and a pen to each student. Everyone's paper was titled \\"10 things you didn't know about the Octopus\\". The students became engrossed in reading facts about their diet, exoskeletons and ink defense when a small bell came from the front. The professor had brought him a small bell and tapped it for their attention.

Three paragraphs, one with her childhood, the second with her adult life and discovery/invention, and the last with her final years","completion":"Sarah Superfloopstein, better known as the inventor of the Eternal Popcorn Generator, was born to a modest family with a mother and father who cared for her. At the early age of three, she showed a strong yearning for education, to which her parents happily supported her, happy to buy books and discuss all sorts of scientific ideas with her - those that she could grasp at such a young age. It was no surprise when she skipped kindergarten and also no surprise when she excelled in every grade she was in thereafter. She was taking college courses during her high school years, and it wasn't long until she graduated college with her Master's in Engineering and Science, with honors. Eager to get to work, she was invited to work at the Lab of Theoretical Sciences and jumped at the opportunity. There, she worked with her peers to run tests, verify, and even create new inventions (or improve older ones). One of her lesser-known contributions is her work on improving the lifespans of apples, giving them twice as much time before they rot and become unfeasible for human consumption. However, it was here that she would work on her biggest invention, the Eternal Popcorn Generator. As a result of previous work, they had discovered certain wormholes and dimensions they could access, if often for brief times. One of these dimensions was one filled with an unlimited amount of popcorn, already popped and never-aging until they were brought into our dimension. Working with a small team, they created an appliance that could tap into this dimension with the flip of a switch, as long as enough electricity was supplied to keep the portal open. And so she was paid trillions for her idea and scientific knowledge and became one of the richest people in the world. In her final years, she retired to a lakeside home, where she continued her research on her terms. She was able to learn much about the different dimensions and their applications but never had quite the same breakthrough that went into the Eternal Popcorn Generator. Eventually, old age caught up to her, and in a bed surrounded by many of her closest friends, relatives, and young scientists she inspired, she passed away.

The horse has gotten into the garden again and mother is angry.","completion":"At daybreak of a radiant February morning, Mario was laying across his bed with his feet up against the wall, talking to his brother Leo about how much he loved his horse. Suddenly his mother entered the room. \\"So there you are!\\" she said, all upset. \\"So there you are! Have you seen your horse?\\" Mario turned red, and then the color drained from his face. \\"What? My what, mamma?\\" \\"Your horse got loose in the garden again and destroyed a bunch of stuff.\\" To Mario, it seemed as if the universe were crashing down on top of him. \\"But ... how?\\" he managed to say. \\"But ... how?\\" \\"Well, I don't know how,\\" his mother answered, \\"but you can't say I haven't warned you! Now, your dad...\\" \\"But I tied him up! I know I did!\\" And as Mario quickly got dressed, his hands shook, and everything he saw was blurred as his eyes filled with tears. When he got to the garden, it was a real disaster. Never had the horse dared to do so much damage. This time he had not only trampled the flowerbeds and knocked down a trellis, but also carried his mischief to the point of uprooting and pawing with his hoof several rare carnations, arranged in an elegant pattern. \\"What have you done? What have you done!?\\" And, as if in a dream, and almost without knowing what he was doing, Mario knelt on the damp ground and began to feverishly replant the flowers while crying \\"Ugh!\\", and \\"You naughty thing!\\" The horse, meanwhile, stood still with his head down, the halter loose, and a certain air of cynical indifference about him. Like a sleepwalker, as if treading on a soft mattress, Mario led the horse by the halter down the middle of the wide, sloping road lined with towering poplars, which ended there, at the white picket fence that opened on the immensity of the wild fields. Looking at the horse sadly, he let him out and shouted, \\"Go! Go! You must Go!\\" Mario cried harder and harder as his beloved horse galloped into the distance."},{"prompt":"Change the steps of these instructions into a list of bullet points and preserve the headings.

I saved up a lot of money for this day and was really happy that the shop still had one in stock. \\"Hope you enjoy!\\" The cashier handed it over to me. I clutched the box like I was hugging a newborn baby. The corners started digging into my face because I was hugging it so hard. The cashier thought it was a little weird, but I didn't really care. Time to head home. I arrived home and cleared the table of all debris. I placed the Victrix Pro FS box on the table and went to look for a pair of scissors. Then, after grabbing the pair of scissors, I start to unbox the arcade stick. The first step was getting the arcade stick out of the box. I slowly cut through the circular stickers that were sealing the box. Each snip of the scissors sounded heavenly as I was one step closer to opening the box. Once the stickers were cut, I put the pair of scissors down for a job well done. I slowly open the box, being careful not to tear it. Each flap is another step toward my grand goal. Once the box is open, I see a purple bag being kept in place by two cardboard holders, one on each side. I gradually slide the bag out of the box, again taking care to not rip the box along the way. Once the arcade stick is out, I put the box to the side and take the cardboard off the side and put it into the box. The only thing left was the purple bag. It was made of a tough, polyester material. It couldn't stand in my way. I undress the arcade stick and see the most beautiful thing. The silver finish on the body.

Drift fishing is a common method where the angler casts a line upstream, lets the line drift down through the run or pool, and then reels in the line to start the process over again. You can drift fish from the shore or an anchored boat. Generally, the idea is to weight your setup so it bounces along the bottom, touching every foot or so, at approximately the same speed the current is moving. More weight will slow down the speed at which your bait drifts downstream and less weight will speed up the drift. The usual strategy is to work the entire run from the shore closest to you to the shore furthest from you, and from the upstream end of the run (near the end of the riffle) to the downstream end of the run (near the start of the next riffle) (Figure 1). Under crowded conditions, you may simply have to work your way into a line of anglers and fish right where you are, without moving. Cast upstream at a 30-45 degree angle and let your bait bounce along until you reach a 45-30 degree angle downstream. Reel in and do it again. Your goal is to bounce your offering along the bottom until a fish picks it up with its mouth.","completion":"Drift fishing involves casting a weighted setup upstream at a 30-45 degree angle from a shore or anchored boat, letting the line drift down the run to a 45-30 degree angle, then reeling in the line and repeating.

Then, inspiration struck. “Thanks, guys, but I’ve got a 2500 award to win,” he told them. “Award?” asked one of his friends. “Who's going to give YOU 2500?\\" Cade dismissed them with a couple of shakes of his hand and said, “You go, I want that 2500 all to myself.” This only served to increase the interest of the group of boys. \\"How are you gonna get all that money?\\" another boy asked. “Well…” Cade sighed, impatiently. “There's a new Instagram challenge: take pictures of your yard before and after mowing it, then they pull the timestamps off your metadata, and if you did it the fastest, relative to the size of your yard, you win and some John Deere lawn mower company gives you 2,500. Or,\\" he paused, thinking, \\"I guess it could be split five ways.\\" The boys offered their enthusiastic support in mowing the yard. \\"500 is a lot of video games!\\" they said. Cade pretended to think about it, then agreed. “Okay, less work for me! Here's the plan: I'll take the 'before' picture, set this lever to 'full speed' mode, and we'll take turns and get this done. Ready?\\" He took the photo and ran after the get-away mower, to the end of the yard and back. “My turn!” each boy said, and Cade watched them battle it out to mow the rest of the yard. With two minutes to spare, the yard was mowed. Cade took the “after” photo\\" for the \\"challenge,\\" just as his father drove up the driveway from work. “What are you boys up to?” he asked. “Not much, said Cade, “but the guys are going down to Marianne’s house to swim. Cool if I go, too?” “You did such a nice job with the yard, Cade!” said his dad. “Of course! Be back before dark!”"},{"prompt":"In one paragraph with four sentences describe how a fiber optic cable works.","completion":"Fiber optic cables are thin strands of glass with the diameter of human hair.

She had long golden hair that flowed down her back in soft curls. Her sparkling green eyes shone like emerald gems. She wore a warm smile and had a heart full of kindness and curiosity. One day, while playing in her backyard, Lily discovered a beautiful flower. It was unlike any other flower she had ever seen before, with petals as big as her hand and colors that shimmered like a rainbow. As she got closer to it, she realized that it was emitting a strange and magical glow. Without thinking twice, Lily reached out and touched the flower, and in an instant, she was surrounded by a bright, dazzling light. When the light faded away, she found herself standing in a mysterious and enchanting garden, filled with mythical creatures, beautiful flowers, and fairy dust floating through the air. As she explored this magical place, she discovered that the iridescent rainbow flower she found was anything but ordinary. It had the power to grant wishes and make dreams come true. She looked around and noticed a group of fairies crying out for help. The fairies’ village was under attack by an army of goblins, and they had nowhere to turn. With courage and determination, Lily took up the flower and charged into the fray. With each wish she made, and each magical spell she cast, Lily grew stronger and fiercer, defeating the goblins one by one. Her golden hair shone brighter, illuminating the dark sky, and her eyes sparkled with powerful magic that even the goblins could not withstand. Just as the final goblin was defeated, Lily turned to see the grateful fairies cheering her on. She was exhausted and exhilarated, but she realized that her magical flower had given her the power to overcome her fears and become a true hero. Lily returned home but realized that the magical flower had also taught her a valuable lesson – that with belief, hard work, and a little bit of magic, anything is possible."},{"prompt":"Please write a short story for me that depicts Gerry's mother making his cherished snack of chocolate-chip cookies and allowing him a single portion. Later, while his mother is not present, Gerry attempts to take an excess of cookies from the jar, but cannot remove his hand while holding them all. Ultimately, he comprehends that greediness is fruitless and releases all the cookies except for one, deducing the ramifications of taking more than what is allotted and how it can impede us from relishing what we already possess.","completion":"One day, Gerry’s mother made his favorite snack – freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. After they had sat on the rack to cool, his mother put them in the cookie jar. They smelled divine, and Gerry’s mouth began to water. “Can I have one?” he asked. “Of course,” his mother replied. “But only one, alright?” When she left the kitchen, Gerry went over to the cookie jar and stuck his hand inside. As he was doing so, he realized his mother was no longer around, meaning there was nobody there to stop him from eating more than one cookie! So Gerry wrapped his fingers around a bunch of cookies and tried pulling his hand out. But try as he might, his fist was now too big to come out of the cookie jar! He struggled a bit, pulling and maneuvering, but he couldn’t free his hand. Finally, he let go of all the cookies except one. He was able to slip his hand out of the cookie jar. As he nibbled on the chocolate chip cookie, he thought, “I guess there’s no point in being greedy, because you can’t have everything.” And he was right! When Gerry stuck to his share of cookies, he was able to take his hand out of the jar.

Unfortunately, misinformation and stigma around the issue often lead to suicides. We want to offer informative advice on how to prevent suicide. 1. You CAN Make a Difference People often overlook this. You CAN make a huge difference and do helpful things to prevent suicide. Learn about it and inform others about the warning signs. You can use available resources so people who are at risk receive support and help. 2. Explore All Your Treatment Options Therapy, peer support groups and many other treatments can help improve your mental health. Discuss these treatments with your doctor and find the right treatment plan. And we can’t say this enough – don't be afraid to ask for help. You don't have to face this alone. 3. Recognize Warning Signs and Respond to Them Suicide tendencies almost always have warning signs like a lack of interest in activities, withdrawal from social connections, sudden mood shifts, impulsivity, and hopelessness. Try to identify and intervene before a crisis arises. Be an active listener and help connect them with professional help. 4. Speaking Up Can Save Lives Talking about suicide will not trigger someone to become suicidal. Open and honest conversations about suicide create a supportive environment and give hope to people who’re on the edge and struggling with their mental health. In the end, being considerate and inclusive goes a long way when it comes to suicide prevention. People often need external support to realize there’s more to life than they think. If you come across someone who has suicidal tendencies, you should talk to the right people about it."},{"prompt":"What is an anatomical snuff box?","completion":"At one time, people would sniff powdered tobacco from the anatomical snuff box.

I hate this place. Outside my cramped box of an apartment, the temp is a cookin’ at 120F degrees. The low buildings of the sprawling city fade into a gray haze, and the sound of jet airplanes constantly booming overhead overwhelms the drone of traffic on the nearby highways. My box sits adjacent to the canal, alongside which runs the railroad. Either side of the canal is a barren stretch of gravel and dirt that runs its whole length through the city, pock-marked with debris and tents for the homeless. On days like this, looking down the length of the canal, all one sees is a blurred mirage cast from the sun-baked earth. Inside my cramped, messy home, staring at the door, I stand parcel in hand. I need to head out into that oven. Earbuds in, stinking of layers of freshly-applied sunscreen, I go out. For all the issues afflicting my run-down apartment, it at least does a good job of keeping this hellscape outside. The moment I step forward I am filled with second thoughts. The heat presses against me from all angles, and my earbuds only partially stifle the cracking sonic booms. “Delivery?!” Dan shouts. I turn toward Dan. He looks at me, laying on his cot inside his tent, drenched in sweat. A veteran from the Pacific conflict thirty years ago, he lives in his tent beside my apartment. A mixed bag of a man. Some nights when it’s cool I’ll sit outside and chat with him for a bit. When he’s not having one of his episodic fits, he’s decent enough for company. “Yeah, delivery,” I shout back. “That sucks,” he says. Or at least I assume that’s what he said, I couldn’t quite hear it. I nod at him and turn to start my day. Only one job in the queue, 240. This job might feed me for the week, but I’ll need to cross my fingers for some more work soon or I might become Dan’s roommate. Sweat is already beading on my forehead, and I haven’t even taken a step. Three miles, one parcel. I hate this place. I walk along the canal, earbuds blasting music into my skull, trying my best to feel nothing."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this page into a brief summary of the types of upcycled foods used in this ice cream series.

King's Landing was besieged by a tyrant and nearly razed, but Arya survived that as well. But now, after twelve long months, two old friends were reunited. Arya returned from adventuring to visit Bran, and she happened to cross paths with Gendry in the Red Keep. \\"Gendry, what are you doing here?\\" Arya said, with shock rippling in her voice. Gendry, the Lord of Storm's End, was equally surprised as he stammered out a reply. \\"Business I'm afraid. A lord's work is never done. But y-you, how are you, Arya?\\" Arya stood there looking up at him and wondering just how the boy she knew grew to be this man. She recalled all the time they spent together evading capture, and that one night before the white walkers attacked. Her cheeks began to blush. Gendry's cheeks were flushing too as he reminisced just as fondly. The two were always friends, and for a time, they were more. But it didn't last. Nothing good ever lasts in Westeros. \\"I'm fine, Gendry.\\" Arya spoke in hushed tones. \\"I'm just here to see Bran. I set off on my own but I just couldn't escape the feeling that what I needed was a home.

The sakura bloomed and welcomed in new students while seeing off the old students who had outstayed their welcome. I was part of those old students. I held my diploma in hand and watched friends and acquaintances whom I'd known for so many years saying their final goodbyes. Sure, some of us would go to the same universities. Some of us were still neighbors and would talk during holidays. Those who were closest might remain friends despite the distance. However, the distance was undeniable. With our graduation, something had changed in us all. We were no longer simply students waiting for the seasons to turn. We were adults now. We would surely have our own worries and responsibilities before long. As I scanned the faces there, I recognized that feeling in everyone's faces. They knew that nothing would ever be the same. They knew they'd likely never see most of these people ever again. For some, it was a sad thing. For others, it might have meant very little. I knew it meant a lot to me, though. I wanted to stay close with my friends. I wanted to meet them during the holidays and talk about that one time during the cultural festival during our second year of high school or the camping trip that was a disaster for this reason and that reason. I wanted to remember how things were together fondly, even though they were tragedies at the time. There was so much that I wished would stay the same.

Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities according to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). Antisemitism and hatred towards Jews did not end with the Holocaust and are on the rise today, meaning antisemitism is still a problem. Antisemitism is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. Antisemitic acts can be criminal when they are defined by law. Criminal acts include but are not limited to, attacks are selected because they target Jewish people or are linked to Jews. Antisemitic discrimination is the denial to Jews of the opportunity or services available to others."},{"prompt":"Make a list of the 5 most common colors in branding.","completion":"1. Blue: Blue is a commonplace color among brands because it exudes dependability and trustworthiness and naturally tends to put people at ease. 2.

When brands want people to take action more urgently, they may incorporate red into their branding. 3. Green: Green can be incorporated into branding to induce impressions of prosperity, growth, and success. Green is often used to publicize new products or to associate with environmental, health, and wellness brands. 4. Purple: Purple can be chosen as a brand color to convey elegance, luxury, and curiosity.

Chandler recommended using currant or crab-apple jelly. What really made the sandwich popular was that during World War II, peanut butter and jelly were on the military list of rations. With peanut butter being shelf-stable and transportable, grapelade (grape jelly) also portable and sweet, plus newly available pre-sliced bread--peanut butter and jelly became a huge part of the U.S. soldier's life. Once those soldiers came home, peanut butter and jelly sales skyrocketed.

Marching ducks forming a line, Quacking as they all align. Mooing sounds straight from the cow, They sure do love their morning chow. Oinking pigs are eating hay, The muddy pit is where they lay. The herding dogs will play and run, Soaking in the springtime sun. The barn holds cats that nap all day, Sometimes coming out to play. Wooly fur grows on the sheep, Birds nearby go chirp and cheep. Llamas prancing all around, Chickens pecking at the ground. The noises from the busy farm, There’s nothing quite like rural charm.

Please make it close to 300 words.","completion":"\\"Welcome, brave heroes. We summoned you here to aid in our war against the Demon king,\\" a priest unironically dressed in tacky robes said. I stared at him and the others around me in disbelief. A moment ago I had been walking home from school with Shinpei, Taka-kun, Shiori, and Mio-san. We were just walking down the sidewalk the same as always when a strange light shone from beneath our feet. It was blinding, and when I could see again, I stood in a cathedral with a magic circle at my feet. Taka-kun asked, \\"Where are we? What's going on!\\" \\"Please, remain calm. We aren't here to hurt you. We will explain everything slowly and answer any questions you may have. But if you would, please,\\" the priest said, motioning another young man to step forward with a glass ball. \\"Set your hands on this ball one at a time, please.\\" We did so, and it lit up, displaying projections that detailed information about us. Afterward, the priest explained. \\"We summoned you here from another world to serve as our heroes in a battle against the Demon king. You all have just been assessed for your stats, magical attributes, and unique skills. As an example, Taka-sama is skilled in wind magic and has a unique skill, called Dead Eye. He will make for an excellent ranger.\\" None of us believed this at first, but it was true. We had been sent to another world. I could use magic better than any of the others. My skills were wildly more powerful than my friends when it came to magic. However, I was sorely lacking in any other stats. We had no choice but to believe that we had come to another world and were now the rumored heroes that had to wage war."},{"prompt":"Write a letter home from the perspective of a man in Africa having trouble with a workforce and feeling as if he has failed.","completion":"Darling, I hope this letter finds you well. I apologize that I haven't been able to write as of late. I fear that the workload here has begun to take its toll on all of us. Talla tells me he is noticing many of the men struggling with morale, and suggests we address it before the week is out. I feel the elements are to blame. There is only so much we can do to accommodate these men, but I'm afraid it is not enough. They are sleeping in the dirt and I mean that literally, with nothing more than a canvas tent to protect them at night. Couple that with the heat and you have miserable working conditions that no one in the world should have to endure. We reached out to Norrington, but he declined additional funding to build barracks. We responded by asking for cots to at least get the men off the ground, but he refused that request as well. In response, Benjamin, and myself have talked about removing the cots from our tents, but Talla advised us that would not change anything. He cheekily stated that we should keep to cots because we will need all the rest we can get to prepare for the day these men decide to blame us for their fates. He said it with a smile, but I'm not convinced it was a joke. Talla is a good man and wise man. His people listen to him and without him here I think this task would have been impossible. Ben and I discussed moving working hours to the evening when the sun went down to help combat the heat exhaustion, but Talla quickly vetoed the idea stating that not only would the number of injuries go up due to the lack of artificial light at night, but that if the lions in the area weren't already a big enough headache to worry about, they certainly would become one. I came here to change the world. To do something great with my life. To lead men and become someone you can be proud of. I do not know if any of this will come to fruition. Please, tell the children I love them and that if things don't get better here in the next few weeks, I may be coming home earlier than expected."},{"prompt":"I have some javascript code that makes a box fall straight down.

Please put it into a bullet list. Neuschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century historicist palace on a rugged hill above the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in southwest Bavaria, Germany, near the border with Austria. The palace was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and in honor of composer Richard Wagner. Ludwig chose to pay for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing, rather than Bavarian public funds. Construction began in 1869 but was never fully completed. The castle was intended as a private residence for the King until he died in 1886. It was opened to the public shortly after his death. Since then more than 61 million people have visited Neuschwanstein Castle. More than 1.3 million people visit annually, with as many as 6,000 per day in the summer.","completion":"• The construction of Neuschwanstein Castle began in 1869 but was never completed • It is located in southwest Bavaria and is visited by over 1 million tourists yearly. • The castle was to be a private residence for King Ludwig II, but he died in 1886. • The castle's construction was funded by the King instead of using the Bavarian people's money."},{"prompt":"Summarize the main steps of how to grow roses in pots that this article suggests, shortened into 5 steps total, in a list format with a 1-2 sentence explanation each. The source text is as follows: Choose and Prepare Containers Choose a relatively large, tall pot when growing a rose bush. Many experts recommend a pot no less than 15 inches in diameter. Roses send down deep roots, so the taller the container, the better. The soil in pots heats up faster than garden soil, so clay pots are generally better than plastic since clay is slower to transfer heat from the sun into the soil. If you must use plastic pots, use lighter colored plastic, which won't heat up as fast as dark plastic. Make sure the pots have ample drainage holes in the bottom. Prepare the Potting Soil Create a potting soil mixture consisting of one-third quality commercial potting soil, one-third garden compost, and one-third composted manure. Add a cup of perlite to enhance drainage. Add 1 cup of bonemeal to the soil mixture. If you wish, you can also add fishmeal or blood meal for added nutrients, but be careful not to over-fertilize, which can burn roots. Plant the Rose Fill the pot about two-thirds full of prepared soil mix. If planting a bare root rose, mound the soil up in the center, then place the rose over the mound and spread the roots out over it. If planting a potted rose, just create a slight indentation, then remove the rose from its nursery container and place it into the pot. Loosen the roots if the plant is root bound. Fill in around the rose using the remaining potting soil, pressing it down firmly around the roots. The soil surface should be just slightly beneath the bud union—the point where the rose is grafted to the rootstock. Place your potted roses in a location that gets at least seven hours of direct sun each day. On patios and decks, this may mean moving the pots around over the course of the day to keep them in the sun. If you are growing groups of potted roses, keep them spaced at least 2 feet apart to ensure good air circulation. Water Thoughtfully Immediately after planting, water the plant thoroughly so that all the soil is well saturated. After planting, keep an eye on your roses so you know when to water. A good general rule of thumb is to water when the top inch of the soil surface feels dry. Fertilize as Needed Repot Every Few Years Except for miniature roses, most roses grown in pots need to be repotted every two or three years, since they are heavy feeders that quickly exhaust potting soils. Using freshly prepared potting soil each time you repot will keep the nutrient levels at an acceptable level. Over time, salts and minerals from fertilizers can also accumulate in the soil. Protect From Freezing Temperatures Mulch the base Bury it Build a cold frame Bring it inside Address Pests and Diseases Potted roses are susceptible to many of the same pests and diseases that can plague roses planted in the garden.","completion":"How to Grow Roses in Pots – 5 Easy Steps 1. Prepare the container & soil – Use a large, tall pot at least 15 inches in diameter that contains drainage holes. Fill that container two-thirds full with premixed soil that contains 1/3 potting soil, 1/3 compost, and 1/3 composted manure. 2. Plant the rose – Remove the rose from its nursery container, loosen the soil slightly, and place it into the pot. Fill soil around the roots, press down firmly, and place in a location where it will receive at least 7 hours of daily direct sunlight. 3. Water the rose – Water thoroughly after planting, and then water every time the top 1-inch of the soil feels dry to the touch. Only watering the soil or using drip irrigation techniques will keep water off the leaves which can help prevent powdery mildew and other unwanted infestations. 4. Care for the rose – Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer designed for roses and repot every few years to protect your rose from nutrient deficiencies or salt build-up in the soil. 5. Protect the rose from freezing – In colder climates roses will need to be protected from harsh winter conditions by mulching or burying the container, using a cold frame, or by bringing it inside. Monitor the potted roses for any signs of pests and disease and act quickly against them to keep the rose growing healthy and productive for years to come."},{"prompt":"Can you explain the concept of time dilation in Einstein's Theory of Relativity?

The May 4 incident was the third time killer whales (Orcinus orca) have sunk a vessel off the coasts of Portugal and Spain in the past three years. The subpopulation of orcas in this region began harassing boats, most often by biting at their rudder, in 2020. Almost 20 percent of these attacks caused enough damage to disable the vessels, says Alfredo López, an orca researcher at the Atlantic Orca Working Group (GTOA), which monitors the Iberian killer whale population. “It is a rare behavior that has only been detected in this part of the world,” he says. Researchers aren’t sure why the orcas are going after the watercraft. There are two hypotheses, according to López. One is that the killer whales have invented a new fad, something that subpopulations of these members of the dolphin family are known to do. Much as in humans, orca fads are often spearheaded by juveniles, López says. Alternatively, the attacks may be a response to a bad past experience involving a boat.","completion":"Once upon a time, in the deep blue sea near Portugal and Spain, there lived a special group of whales called killer whales or orcas. These orcas were known for their beautiful black-and-white patterns and their playful nature. But something strange was happening. Over the past three years, these orcas had been causing trouble for boats sailing in their waters. The orcas would approach the boats and occasionally even bite their rudders, making it challenging for the boats to steer. Can you imagine that? Some of the boats were so badly damaged that they were unable to even move! When Alfredo López was researching these orcas, he discovered that nearly 20% of their attacks rendered the boats unusable. Each person was confused. Why were the orcas acting so naughtily? The scientists had two theories. One theory was that the orcas had devised a brand-new sport to engage in with the boats. Just like you know how we create new games from time to time just for fun. These orcas may have followed suit. The alternative theory suggested that perhaps the orcas were acting defensively because they were trying to remember something bad that had happened to them in the past involving a boat. And so, every day, as the sun set and the stars came out, the orcas and the people continued their adventures in the big, beautiful ocean, waiting to unravel the mystery of the playful orcas.

Two species of palo santo trees are distributed in the Galápagos archipelago, the native Bursera graveolens, and the endemic Bursera malacophylla (Burseraceae). Native Bursera graveolens is the same variety you can find in mainland Ecuador and other countries like Peru. It is called native because it is not an introduced plant, but it came to the islands naturally, thousands of years ago. Bursera malacophylla, on the other hand, grows exclusively in the Galapagos Islands. Palo santo trees (Bursera Jacq. ex L.; Burseraceae) are among the most common and easily recognizable indicator species of the dry and transition zone flora in the Galápagos archipelago. Most of the year, the tree is leafless, but in the rainy season, it quickly produces thin blue-green leaves with toothed edges. The olive shapes fruit turn bright red when ripe, and burst open to reveal black seeds inside.

Made it back to the farm yesterday afternoon to find that some of the grass has grown over a foot in two weeks. A very 'back to reality' moment. On the boats, flights and taxis I just took, had the opportunity to ponder bubbles. Fiji isn't the bubble it was growing up. The internet, even on Tokoriki, was comparable to what I get in Tasmania. (It's possible the video streaming was even faster, actually.) Once upon a childhood, you would emerge from a Fijian holiday unsure if the wider world even existed. No news reached you. It was blissful. Nowadays, even astrology as fascism manages to reach you. But that's not quite the bubble was pondering. I have been thinking about filter bubbles in the World Without Sin context. We think we know what filter bubbles are. Filter bubbles are when you exist in a (mostly digital) ecosystem where only 'news' that you agree with or already believe is true manages to reach you. This is only half of what constitutes a filter bubble. The other half -and mean half- of what reaches you is the worst possible examples of opinions you do not agree with. Gun laws, climate change, freedoms of speech. Wherever you land on them, you will only see the worst examples of the opposite opinion. This half of filter bubble creation is much worse, largely because most people are too stupid to see it. Most people, even boomer facebook, are dimly aware that they are generally only exposed to ideas they are already primed to align with. But they will still flip out -all caps, mispellings everywhere- when particularly egregious example of idiocy swims up their feed. Never mind that in almost all cases these opinions define the term 'non-representative'.

Trinity and Morpheus were waiting for him. They urged him to leave the Matrix and join them in the real world. But something inside of Neo held him back. What if he didn't want to leave? What if he could make a life for himself here, in this simulated reality? No one knew why except Neo himself. Neo took a deep breath and turned to face his friends. \\"I'm staying,\\" he said firmly. Trinity's eyes widened in shock. \\"What? Neo, you can't be serious.\\" Morpheus placed a hand on Neo's shoulder. \\"Neo, we've fought for years to free ourselves from the Matrix. Why would you want to stay here?\\" Neo looked up at Morpheus. \\"Because maybe, for me, this is better. I can't explain it, but I feel like I belong here. I can make a difference – I can help people. And I don't want to lose that.\\" Trinity stepped forward, her eyes brimming with tears. \\"Neo, please. Don't do this. You're the One, the only hope we have of defeating the machines. If you stay here, they'll find you and destroy you.\\" Neo shook his head. \\"I'm sorry, Trinity, but I have to follow my path now.\\" With that, Neo turned and walked back towards the door leading back into the building. He didn't look back, didn't see the anguish on Trinity and Morpheus' faces. He knew he was making the right decision for himself, but that didn't make it any easier. As he re-entered the Matrix, Neo felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that he was taking a risk, that the machines might eventually find him and erase him from existence. But for now, he was content. He had found a purpose, a sense of belonging that he had never felt in the real world. Years went by, and Neo became a legendary figure in The Matrix. He used his powers to help others, to fight against the oppression of the machines in his way. And even though he knew that his time in the Matrix was limited, he didn't regret his decision to stay."},{"prompt":"I need to write a short letter to an RA I have supervised this year, thanking them and wishing them well after the graduate.","completion":"Dear [student], I have loved getting to know and work with you this year.

Review content: In a review of the special edition reissue of Opeth's 2005 collection Ghost Reveries, I quoted band leader Mikael Åkerfeldt as saying that what his group does is \\"more than metal.\\" At the time, the forward-thinking Swedish group was still very much performing within the metal tradition. On their 10th album, Heritage, they aren't. For longtime fans, the shift from progressive death metal to full-on progressive rock won't be a surprise: 2003's Damnation gave a good idea of what Åkerfeldt sounded like doing clean vocals sans death growls, and since 1995's debut, Orchid, he's never been afraid to stretch the templates of all the genres they incorporate. (Åkerfeldt's used his airier croon for ages-- here, more confident in that angle, he removed the heavier stuff and expanded upon the airier bridges.) What might surprise you, though, is the intense completeness of the transition: Heritage's 1970s-inspired prog feels more like the follow-up to fellow countrymen Dungen's 2004 opus Ta Det Lugnt than Opeth's own Watershed. The 10-song collection is another collaboration with Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson, who mixed the record with Åkerfeldt-- it has a warm, analog feel, something that lives up to the colors of the cover painting. The brief opening title track is a plaintive, scene-setting piano piece Åkerfeldt says was inspired by Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and the folk music of his country. Elsewhere, guest spots from Swedish flautist Björn J:son Lindh and Weather Report percussionist Alex Acuña (both on eight-minute loud-quiet-loud standout \\"Famine\\"), give Heritage a mystical, pastoral feel. If you've heard only the King Crimson-nodding lead track, \\"The Devil's Orchard\\", you have a good idea what to expect: an exuberant, forward rushing blend of bell-bottomed jazziness and Deep Purple, Camel, and Jethro Tull love made more complex with quick tempo shifts, stop-on-a-dime implosions, and breezy, racing, drifting, and other sorts of atmospheric, psychedelic flourishes. Another track, the muscular \\"Slither\\", is appropriately dedicated to Ronnie James Dio. The 37-year-old Åkerfeldt, who says Heritage is an album he's been \\"building up to write for and participate on\\" since he was 19, has also mentioned listening to Alice Cooper frequently over the past year. You won't necessarily detect the latter in any obvious way, but you'll feel it in the album's appropriation of the texture and atmosphere of an era. Åkerfeldt and co. do offer a convincing take-- it's a pretty, well-thought out collection-- but for all the ideas and layers, Heritage feels somewhat empty. It's the group's most genre-melding, but it's also the most obvious, largely because much of it sounds like things we've heard before. The lifelessness may also be the result of the singularity of the vision: Heritage lacks the usual shift and pull between heavy and soft that they've managed to weave into their music for the past two decades. It feels a bit listless and emotionally distant. When it comes down to it, Åkerfeldt's death growl is more memorable than his rock singing (and both work best when you get them together). There are dynamics here, but not the kind that create unexpected chills. The story behind Travis Smith's colorful cover painting is instructive. We're told Åkerfeldt gave the artist a number of references including Pieter Bruegel's \\"The Triumph of Death\\", Hieronymus Bosch (in general), and the Beatles' Yellow Submarine. The final picture depicts a tree sprouting the heads of each Opeth member with the noggin of ex-keyboardist and backing vocalist Per Wiberg, who left the band after recording his parts for the new record, toppling into \\"a pile of ex-members' skulls.\\" Beneath those skulls? The roots of the tree that point to the band's devilish roots in death metal. We're also told the nine stars in the sky represent Opeth's nine past albums, the sun representing Heritage. Then comes the line of people \\"want[ing] a piece\\" of the band, etc. It's fine to get conceptual, of course, but the forced, overripe symbolism of this image and its fussiness point to a problem with the record: Åkerfeldt remembered to include everything here except space for his songs to breathe. He refers to Opeth records as \\"observations\\" and, ultimately, for all its considerable beauty, Heritage too often feels like a passive, backward glance.","completion":"The review you've shared would indicate the album is poor in comparison to other offerings from Opeth. Although the review contains both positive and negative language usage throughout, the closing paragraphs offer a clearer classification of the album, with sentences such as: \\"Heritage lacks the usual shift and pull between heavy and soft that they've managed to weave into their music for the past two decades. It feels a bit listless and emotionally distant.\\" And, \\"Åkerfeldt remembered to include everything here except space for his songs to breathe. He refers to Opeth records as \\"observations\\" and, ultimately, for all its considerable beauty, Heritage too often feels like a passive, backward glance.\\" both being indicative of a negative view of the album when compared to the band's overall catalogue."},{"prompt":"My dear friend Sue has taken a big leap and started her own business!

The audience is small children, and it should be less than 400 words long.","completion":"When Willie the Weasel woke up on Saturday, he could hear the raindrops outside of his mountain cave. Willie glanced outside and realized it was raining quite a bit. He wondered how he was going to be able to play with his friend Fannie the Fox that day since they couldn't frolic around as usual. All of a sudden, Willie heard a howl. “Willie! Come out and play!” Willie knew the sound of Fannie’s voice. He wondered how Fannie could be outside since she didn’t like to get her fur wet. Surely, they wouldn’t be able to play together on a rainy day. Just then someone appeared at the entrance of the cave. It was Fannie, with large leaves strapped to her back with twine. It covered her body so that her fur wasn’t wet. \\"Hi, Willie! I have one of my inventions for you, too!” Fannie said happily. “What a great idea!” Willie exclaimed. “Where did you get the leaves?” The leaves looked larger than the usual leaves near their mountain homes. “I brought them back with me when we went on that journey to the hills,” Fannie explained. The leaves were large and felt waxy. They were good for repelling water. Quickly, she tied a leaf to Willie’s back. It fit perfectly. It was keeping the raindrops off of his fur, just as planned. \\"Now we can go play!\\" Willie exclaimed, swishing his gray tail back and forth. \\"Tag, you’re it!” Willie bounced ahead out of the cave and down the mountain path. The duo had a lot of fun zigging and zagging, all the while staying dry.

A competent spin bowler (spinner) would be capable of controlling and varying each delivery depending on tactics and making it difficult for a batsman to hit the ball. The bowler delivers the cricket ball with fast rotation when it leaves the hand so that when the ball bounces on the pitch it may deviate. Spin bowlers are significantly slower than pace bowlers and throw the ball at about 45 mph to 55 mph. Spin bowlers may be finger spinners (impart rotation by using the fingers) or wrist spinners (impart rotation by using the wrist). The different types of spin bowling include: 1. Off spin: this is the most common type of finger spin and is delivered by a right-handed person. The ball deviates off the pitch from left to right. 2. Left-arm orthodox spin: this is a finger spin of a left-handed person's version of an off spin. The ball deviates from right to left. 3: Leg spin: this is delivered by a right-handed wrist spinner and the ball deviates from right to left. 4: Left arm unorthodox spin: this is delivered by a left-handed wrist spinner and the ball deviates from left to right."},{"prompt":"Write a summary about wombats.

Could you describe the advantages there might be in staying in an AirBnB instead?","completion":"Sure! Here are the advantages you might find when staying in an Airbnb over a hotel: 1. More Space: Airbnbs are often an entire house or apartment, meaning you have more space than in a hotel room. This is handy for long-term stays or large groups. 2. More Amenities: Because Airbnbs are usually someone's home, there are usually more amenities. For example, they may have a full kitchen where you can cook food, whereas it's unlikely a hotel will have this. 3. Cheaper Pricing: Although it's not guaranteed, Airbnbs are often less expensive than large hotels since their prices aren't dictated by a corporation. 4. More Flexibility: For the same reason, Airbnb might have more flexibility than a hotel, which usually has firmly fixed check-in and out times dictated by the company. If you need to check in earlier or out later, an Airbnb owner might be more willing to accommodate this. They also may have more flexible cancellation policies. 5. More Pet-Friendly: Many Airbnbs are more pet-friendly than hotels, though it's important to check with the owner. 6. More Privacy: Depending on your booking, you may have more privacy in an Airbnb unlike having to cross through the hotel lobby every time you need to get in and out. Remember, it's always important to read the reviews and policies on Airbnb accommodations before a booking, as these aren't all guaranteed."},{"prompt":"Rewrite the text as a quick diary entry Resident advisors are called resident counselors in England.

Geoffrey Hinton, a trailblazer in artificial intelligence, has joined the growing list of experts sharing their concerns about the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. The renowned computer scientist recently left his job at Google to speak openly about his worries about the technology and where he sees it going. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” Hinton said in an interview with The New York Times. Hinton is worried that future versions of the technology pose a real threat to humanity. “The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” he said in the interview. “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.” Geoffrey Hinton at Google&#39;s Mountain View, Calif, headquarters (Noah Berger / AP file ) Geoffrey Hinton at Google's Mountain View, Calif, headquarters (Noah Berger / AP file ) Hinton, 75, is most noted for the rapid development of deep learning, which uses mathematical structures called neural networks to pull patterns from massive sets of data. Like other experts, he believes the race between Big Tech to develop more powerful AI will only escalate into a global race. Hinton tweeted Monday morning that he felt Google had acted responsibly in its development of AI, but that he had to leave the company to speak out. Jeff Dean, senior vice president of Google Research and AI, said in an emailed statement: “Geoff has made foundational breakthroughs in AI, and we appreciate his decade of contributions at Google. I’ve deeply enjoyed our many conversations over the years. I’ll miss him, and I wish him well! As one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We’re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.” Hinton is a notable addition to a group of technologists that have been speaking out publicly about the unbridled development and release of AI. Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin, the co-founders of the Center for Humane Technology, spoke with “Nightly News” host Lester Holt in March about their own concerns around AI. “What we want is AI that enriches our lives. AI that works for people, that works for human benefit that is helping us cure cancer, that is helping us find climate solutions,” Harris said during the interview. “We can do that. We can have AI and research labs that’s applied to specific applications that does advance those areas. But when we’re in an arms race to deploy AI to every human being on the planet as fast as possible with as little testing as possible, that’s not an equation that’s going to end well.” An open letter from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, which was signed by 19 current and former leaders of academic society, was released last month warning the public of the risks around AI and the need for collaboration to mitigate some of those concerns. “We believe that AI will be increasingly game-changing in healthcare, climate, education, engineering, and many other fields,” the letter said. “At the same time, we are aware of the limitations and concerns about AI advances, including the potential for AI systems to make errors, to provide biased recommendations, to threaten our privacy, to empower bad actors with new tools, and to have an impact on jobs.” Hinton, along with scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, won the Turing Award in 2019, known as the tech industry’s version of the Nobel Prize, for their advancements in AI. Hinton, Bengio and LeCun were open about their concerns with AI but were optimistic about the potential of the technology, including detecting health risks earlier than doctors and more accurate weather warnings about earthquakes and floods. “One thing is very clear, the techniques that we developed can be used for an enormous amount of good affecting hundreds of millions of people,” Hinton previously told The Associated Press.

Erin was already beginning her incantations. “Oh, great spirits! We call upon your wisdom and your power! Our coven seeks your aid! If you deem us worthy, grace us with the presence of your most powerful incarnation. We invoke a demon of great strength, loyalty, and prowess! We seek…” I tuned out, instead enjoying the hypnotic shape of the flames and the calming sounds of the forest. My trance snapped, however, when the bonfire erupted violently in a shower of sparks and smoke that masked a huge but unmistakable bipedal figure. As our five screams faded, they were replaced by a low, rumbling sound. Though near the lower end of my hearing range, there was no mistaking it. It was a voice. “I was summoned. I have come.”"},{"prompt":"Hi, I've got some big problems with my program. I'm trying to learn how to use Python to create interactive programs with a GUI, but I'm having a really hard time even implementing a simple cursor scrolling around a screen. I think I have a little bit of an understanding of how to do this, but I'm getting all sorts of problems. Like, okay, I'm making just a square black cursor that moves around the screen, right? When it touches the edge of the screen, it should \\"crash\\" and be reset in the middle of the screen, sort of like a game piece colliding with a wall or something. But I can't ever reach the edge of the screen. I only get part way and then it breaks and starts over. Another problem I'm having is that the square doesn't move the way I want it to. For example, when it's moving forward in any direction, the square gets squashed down. I don't really know how to describe it, but it gets shortened in the direction of motion for some reason. Otherwise I guess I figured out how to make it move and stop the way I want, so I don't think that any of the move commands need to be changed, but maybe they do to fix the problem. If you do need to fix them, please don't make it so the user can go backwards. So if the cursor is currently moving left, it can't just start going right. It needs to \\"turn\\" by either going up or down first. That's why I made the statements like \\"if cursor.direction != \\"down\\":\\" to check for turning behavior. Here's the code I wrote, could you please help me figure it out? # import modules import turtle import time #Set tickrate tick = 0.01 # Create a window wn = turtle.Screen() wn.title(\\"Cursor Test\\") wn.bgcolor(\\"white\\") # Set window size window_width = 1000 window_height = 1000 wn.setup(window_width, window_height) wn.tracer(0) # Implement cursor cursor = turtle.Turtle() cursor.shape(\\"square\\") cursor.color(\\"black\\") cursor.penup() cursor.goto(0, 0) cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" # Implement inputs def move_up(): if cursor.direction != \\"down\\": cursor.direction = \\"up\\" def move_down(): if cursor.direction != \\"up\\": cursor.direction = \\"down\\" def move_left(): if cursor.direction != \\"right\\": cursor.direction = \\"left\\" def move_right(): if cursor.direction != \\"left\\": cursor.direction = \\"right\\" def halt(): cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" def move(): if cursor.direction == \\"up\\": y = cursor.ycor() cursor.sety(y+10) if cursor.direction == \\"down\\": y = cursor.ycor() cursor.sety(y-10) if cursor.direction == \\"left\\": x = cursor.xcor() cursor.setx(x-10) if cursor.direction == \\"right\\": x = cursor.xcor() cursor.setx(x+10) # Keyboard inputs wn.listen() wn.onkeypress(move_up, \\"w\\") wn.onkeypress(move_down, \\"s\\") wn.onkeypress(move_left, \\"a\\") wn.onkeypress(move_right, \\"d\\") wn.onkeypress(halt, \\"space\\") # Scroll Cursor based on user inputs while True: wn.update() if cursor.xcor() > 290 or cursor.xcor() < -290 or cursor.ycor() > 290 or cursor.ycor() < -290: time.sleep(1) cursor.goto(0, 0) cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" move() time.sleep(tick) wn.mainloop()","completion":"Reviewing the code you provided, I see some issues which may be causing the unexpected behavior you described. The first issue you reported, the cursor failing to reach the edge of the window, is related to the mismatch between the size of the window and the if statement which detects the edge of the window. It's possible that in your earlier testing, you were using a window size of 600 by 600 pixels, based on the implementation of edge detection in the following if statement: \`\`\`Python if cursor.xcor() > 290 or cursor.xcor() < -290 or cursor.ycor() > 290 or cursor.ycor() < -290: \`\`\` The way this line of code works is it measures the distance the cursor has traveled from the origin 0,0 which is the center of the window created by your code. You can correct this problem by changing the dimensions of the window to a height and width of 600 pixels, or you can modify the if statement to make the boundaries relative to the window. Here's one way of implementing a relative boundary: \`\`\`Python # Define window edges left_edge = 0 - (window_width / 2) + 10 right_edge = 0 + (window_width / 2) - 10 top_edge = 0 + (window_height / 2) - 10 bottom_edge = 0 - (window_height / 2) + 10 \`\`\` With these four new variables, which are based on the size of the window, the if statement which monitors the position of the cursor for edge collisions can be changed to use the variables. \`\`\`Python if cursor.xcor() > right_edge or cursor.xcor() < left_edge or cursor.ycor() > top_edge or cursor.ycor() < bottom_edge: \`\`\` The second issue you reported, the unexpected shortening of the cursor in the direction of movement, is likely related to a combination of the cursor's movement speed and the program's tick rate. The tick variable determines how often the window is updated. Currently, the tick variable is assigned a value of 0.01, which would mean that the window would update 100 times per second. This may cause unexpected behavior, especially if the window is viewed on a display with a 60-hertz refresh rate. The tick rate can be modified to a larger value, which may resolve the display issue you described. Setting the value of the tick variable to 0.016 would cause the window to update 60 times per second, which may result in better performance and avoid the visual artifact you described. Additional changes to the cursor's movement speed may also be useful. The cursor is currently set to a speed of 10 units in the current direction of travel. Lowering this value may make the appearance of the cursor's motion more smooth. Below is a revised version of the code you shared in your request, altered to incorporate the relative screen edge collision detection and a lower tick rate. \`\`\`Python # import modules import turtle import time # Set tick rate tick = 0.016 # Create a window wn = turtle.Screen() wn.title(\\"Cursor Test\\") wn.bgcolor(\\"white\\") # Set window size window_width = 1000 window_height = 1000 wn.setup(window_width, window_height) wn.tracer(0) # Define window edges left_edge = 0 - (window_width / 2) + 10 right_edge = 0 + (window_width / 2) - 10 top_edge = 0 + (window_height / 2) - 10 bottom_edge = 0 - (window_height / 2) + 10 # Implement cursor cursor = turtle.Turtle() cursor.shape(\\"square\\") cursor.color(\\"black\\") cursor.penup() cursor.goto(0, 0) cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" # Implement inputs def move_up(): if cursor.direction != \\"down\\": cursor.direction = \\"up\\" def move_down(): if cursor.direction != \\"up\\": cursor.direction = \\"down\\" def move_left(): if cursor.direction != \\"right\\": cursor.direction = \\"left\\" def move_right(): if cursor.direction != \\"left\\": cursor.direction = \\"right\\" def halt(): cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" def move(): if cursor.direction == \\"up\\": y = cursor.ycor() cursor.sety(y + 10) if cursor.direction == \\"down\\": y = cursor.ycor() cursor.sety(y - 10) if cursor.direction == \\"left\\": x = cursor.xcor() cursor.setx(x - 10) if cursor.direction == \\"right\\": x = cursor.xcor() cursor.setx(x + 10) # Keyboard inputs wn.listen() wn.onkeypress(move_up, \\"w\\") wn.onkeypress(move_down, \\"s\\") wn.onkeypress(move_left, \\"a\\") wn.onkeypress(move_right, \\"d\\") wn.onkeypress(halt, \\"space\\") # Scroll Cursor based on user inputs while True: wn.update() if cursor.xcor() > right_edge or cursor.xcor() < left_edge or cursor.ycor() > top_edge or cursor.ycor() < bottom_edge: time.sleep(1) cursor.goto(0, 0) cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" move() time.sleep(tick) wn.mainloop() \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"Write a criticism of late-night television show writers who use unoriginal content. 2 paragraphs.","completion":"The writers for a weekly late-night comedy show seem to be stuck.

Give me some tips on how to get into a regular meditation practice that I can do in the morning before work. Don't include tips that require me to go outside.","completion":"Here are some helpful tips for learning how to maintain focus during a morning meditation! 1. Start small and build up If you have trouble maintaining focus throughout your entire meditation, start with just two or three minutes. Once your body and mind get used to the feeling of meditation, maintaining stillness will become easier. Build slowly, adding a minute or two every week. You can even set a timer so you don't have to focus on how long it's been. 2. Use the Hong-Sau Technique To perform the Hong-Sau Technique, sit perfectly upright with your legs folded. Slowly inhale for a count of eight, and then slowly exhale for the same count. During your inhale, say \\"hong\\" in your head. On each exhale, say \\"sau\\" in your head. Repeat six times to gain concentration and focus. 3. Focus on comfort Instead of trying to maintain perfect posture, try to choose a position that is comfortable for you. Find a place with limited distractions where you can feel at peace. If you're more comfortable laying down or keeping your eyes open, that's ok too. 4. Consume raisins Studies show that eating about half a cup of raisins, which contain boron, can help improve focus and attentiveness. 5. Try a guided meditation Guided meditation can help you maintain focus and eliminate distractions by providing something to give you something to concentrate on that is related to your practice. 6. Use earplugs Earplugs are a great way to eliminate distractions from outside noises. Noise-canceling headphones or white noise is another way to remove noisy distractions.

It is the most common nerve entrapment neuropathy, accounting for 90% of all neuropathies. Early symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include pain, numbness, and paresthesias. These symptoms typically present, with some variability, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the radial half (thumb side) of the ring finger. Pain also can radiate up the affected arm. With further progression, hand weakness, decreased fine motor coordination, clumsiness, and thenar atrophy can occur. In the early presentation of the disease, symptoms most often present at night when lying down and are relieved during the day. With further progression of the disease, symptoms will also be present during the day, especially with certain repetitive activities, such as when drawing, typing, or playing video games. In more advanced disease, symptoms can be constant. Typical occupations of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome include those who use computers for extended periods of time, those who use equipment that has vibration such as construction workers, and any other occupation requiring frequent, repetitive movement.","completion":"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition where a nerve gets trapped between two other things like ligaments and bones. People’s wrists have something called a carpal tunnel going through them and when the median nerve (the nerve that goes through the arm) gets trapped, it can cause pain, numbness or a tingling feeling. The median nerve is responsible for 90% of trapped nerves related to nerve damage. People usually get some of the symptoms of CTS in their thumbs, pointer finger, middle finger, and the side of the ring finger that faces the thumb. The symptoms will vary with each person. They can get pain that moves up their arm, too, and the worse the problem gets, the weaker the hand muscles can become. It can get bad enough to cause problems using the hand and make people clumsy. When CTS first starts, people usually get symptoms at night when they’re lying down, and not so much during the day. As it gets worse, the symptoms start to happen even during the day, especially when they’re doing things like drawing, typing or playing games, since those things make people do things over and over. In the worst cases, people will have symptoms all the time. People who are most likely to start having symptoms like tingling, numbness and pain are those who use computers for a long time each day and people who work with machines that have constant vibration. Any job where people have to do the same things over and over a lot can cause Carpal tunnel syndrome."},{"prompt":"I'm trying to brainstorm a list of games my family can play that just involve dice and nothing more (we forgot to pack anything else, lol).

Here is the text I'm asking about: But even if we don’t have a perfect understanding of the brain processes involved in cognitive control and self-correction, there are simpler things we can do. One is to become more comfortable with making mistakes. We might think that this is the wrong attitude towards failures, but it is in fact a more positive way forward. Our society denigrates failures and mistakes, and consequently we are likely to feel shame for our mistakes, and try and hide them. The more guilty and ashamed we feel, and the more we try and hide our mistakes from others, the more likely we are to repeat them. When we not feeling so down about ourselves, we are more likely to be better at taking on new information that can help us correct our mistakes. It can also be a good idea to take a break from performing a task that we want to learn how to do better. Acknowledging our failures and pausing to consider them can help us reduce frequency bias, which will make us less likely to repeat our mistakes and reinforce the mistake pathways.","completion":"Frequency bias can be reduced if one acknowledges their mistakes and failures and pauses to reflect on them before trying to perform the task again."},{"prompt":"Can you summarize the concept of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility in this article section in easy terms? The law of diminishing marginal utility explains that as a person consumes an item or a product, the satisfaction or utility they derive from the product wanes as they consume more and more of that product. For example, an individual might buy a certain type of chocolate for a while. Soon, they may buy less and choose another type of chocolate or buy cookies instead because the satisfaction they were initially getting from the chocolate is diminishing. Understanding the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Whenever an individual interacts or consumes an economic good, that individual acts in a way that demonstrates the order in which they value the use of that good. Thus, the first unit that is consumed satisfies the consumer's greatest need. The second unit results in a lesser amount of satisfaction, and so on. For example, consider an individual on a deserted island who finds a case of bottled water that washes ashore. That person might drink the first bottle indicating that satisfying their thirst was the most important use of the water. The individual might bathe themselves with the second bottle, or they might decide to save it for later. If they save it for later, this indicates that the person values the future use of the water more than bathing today, but still less than the immediate quenching of their thirst. This is called ordinal time preference. This concept helps explain savings and investing versus current consumption and spending. The example above also helps to explain why demand curves are downward sloping in microeconomic models since each additional unit of a good or service is put toward a less valuable use.","completion":"The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility explains that the value people place on goods decreases as they consume more units of it. For example, the satisfaction derived from one bottle of water may quench thirst, but the additional ones do not hold the same value for bathing or saving for the future. The concept explains why people choose to save and invest instead of spending immediately, and why demand curves have a downward slope in microeconomics."},{"prompt":"Pretend that you are a high-school student preparing to graduate.

Then one day, the duckling’s mom pulled her aside and said, “Little One, it’s time for you to leave and explore the pond on your own.” The duckling was incredibly confused; leaving her family? Where would she go? What would she do? Where would she sleep if she didn’t sleep in the reeds? The duckling swam away quietly, completely unsure of what she was supposed to do now. She was so upset that she left the pond and started walking across the green grass, lost in her own thoughts. Finally, she stumbled upon another pond - one she had never seen before. A whole group of young ducks came swimming over and shouting at her, “what are you doing here? Where did you come from?” While the young duck was scared, she explained how she had left home to find a new home.

Maybe it's a primal thing, maybe we're just remembering how our distant human ancestors listened to wolf howls over a campfire but one thing is clear: howling at the moon is fun! How to Howl 1. Find audio recordings of actual wolf howls and listen to them. Listen to how the wolf howl changes pitch and how long the howl lasts. 2. Inhale until your lungs are full to capacity with air. 3. Form a wolf muzzle by cupping your hands around your mouth. 4. Start howling at a low pitch then let your voice pitch slowly rise. Now let your howl get slowly louder. 5. Keep howling until you run out of air then let your howl gradually fade. Where to Howl 1. Find a high spot to howl. Your voice will travel farther if you howl from a high point. 2. If you're out in the wilderness, locate a high cliff or plateau. Remember to use common sense and don't get too close to the edge. 3. Go ahead and howl and wait for a response.

Include a three-sentence introduction, a bulleted list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions in paragraph form.","completion":"In addition to repelling pests, garlic has strong antifungal properties. Garlic spray controls fungal plant diseases like leaf spots, early and late blight, and powdery mildew. This spray also works as a contact insecticide. However, be aware it will kill pests and beneficial insects like ladybugs, so be mindful of your little garden helpers when applying it. DIY Garlic Spray to Control Insects and Fungus - 1 head of garlic - 2 cups of water - 1 tablespoon of bleach-free dish soap - 2 tablespoons of mineral or vegetable oil Peel the garlic, place the cloves and water in a food processor or blender, and liquefy. Let the mixture sit overnight. Then, strain out any remaining garlic pieces and pour the liquid into a clean spray bottle. Next, add the liquid dish soap and mineral or vegetable oil and shake the bottle vigorously to blend. Spray all plant parts thoroughly, including both sides of the leaves. Fungal spores tend to emerge on the leaves undersides, and it's also a favorite hiding spot for insects. This DIY garlic spray is also an effective pest repellent. Use it wherever you notice significant pest activity in your garden.

Climate change is happening. Global average temperature has increased about 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016.1 Changes of one or two degrees in the average temperature of the planet can cause potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather. These real, observable changes are what we call climate change impacts​​​​​​ because they are the visible ways that climate change is affecting the Earth. For example, many places have experienced changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves. The planet's oceans and glaciers have also experienced changes—oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, ice caps are melting, and sea level is rising. As these and other changes become more pronounced in the coming decades, they will likely present challenges to our society and our environment. Warmer temperatures increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves,2 which can pose health risks, particularly for young children and the elderly. Climate change can also impact human health by worsening air and water quality, increasing the spread of certain diseases, and altering the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events.3 Rising sea level threatens coastal communities and ecosystems.4 Changes in the patterns and amount of rainfall, as well as changes in the timing and amount of stream flow, can affect water supplies and water quality and the production of hydroelectricity.5 Changing ecosystems influence geographic ranges of many plant and animal species and the timing of their lifecycle events, such as migration and reproduction.6 Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, and floods, can increase losses to property, cause costly disruptions to society, and reduce the affordability of insurance.7","completion":"It can be denied no longer: climate change is real, and it is a threat to the globe. The average temperature has been raised by almost 2°F in the past century, causing dramatic and unprecedented effects across the world. We need to put an end to this before it causes deeper and more permanent changes to our lives, ecosystem, and planet. Our air is being polluted, our ecosystems are being threatened, our seas are rising, and our planet is being destroyed. Communities across the globe are being harmed: not just ours, but those of wildlife as well. These changes are causing more natural disasters which can be seen in extreme weather events like droughts, floods, wildfires, and heat waves. To stop these events that endanger us all, we must put an end to the causes of climate change, both to better our planet and to better the lives of ourselves and future generations. We must put every effort we have into stopping climate change before it progresses further and causes irreparable damage. We must save our planet: we are obligated to."},{"prompt":"What is the role of magnesium in the human body, and what are the consequences of magnesium deficiency?","completion":"Magnesium is an essential mineral required by the human body for a multitude of biochemical reactions. It plays a crucial role in energy production, protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. Magnesium is also important in bone development and helps with DNA and RNA synthesis. Despite its importance, magnesium deficiency, or hypomagnesemia, is not uncommon and can result from various factors such as poor dietary intake, chronic alcoholism, certain medications, or problems with intestinal absorption. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms may include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. As the deficiency worsens, more serious symptoms can develop such as numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms. Long term magnesium deficiency can also lead to more chronic conditions. For example, it can exacerbate osteoporosis by affecting the balance of calcium in the body and reducing the effectiveness of Vitamin D. Several studies have associated low magnesium levels with chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and migraine headaches."},{"prompt":"Do camels store water in their humps?","completion":"No, contrary to popular belief, a camel's humps do not hold any water.

Sam walked out of the locker room onto the soccer pitch alongside his teammates. They were about to play for the state championship after making it through a grueling batch of playoff games. Half of the team seemed to have some minor nagging injury, but they were all determined to grit their teeth and push through for one final game. The team lined up in their positions and the game began. Sam was a striker and played in a forward position on the field. He had spent the year prior doing sprints and other exercises to gain a speed advantage over his defenders. This benefitted Sam and his team greatly throughout the season as he was often able to consistently stride past the other team and score goals. Sam was the team's leading scorer and he certainly felt immense pressure to strike his team to victory tonight. The first half of the game was intense with neither team gaining an edge over the other. Sam's legs were tired; he had made several sprints down the field hoping for a pass to come his way, but his teammates were having little success getting clean passes through. The defensive players on the other team were large and athletic and offered few gaps Sam could take advantage of. Halftime seemed to breeze by, and before long the teams re-entered the pitch. The second half brought more of the same, with neither team having any luck offensively. There were only a few minutes left in regulation with the score tied at zero. Sam's team suddenly found themselves with a golden opportunity. A defender on the opposing team had tripped on a slick spot on the field. Sam's team had possession of the ball, and Sam bolted down the field. He was finally able to get a pass sent his way, and he found himself with one defender to beat. He urged his aching muscles to cooperate as he blazed past his opponent. With a clean look at the goal, he delivered a powerful strike. The ball whipped past the goalie and into the net behind him.

Here are six tips to polish your interview performance: 1. Arrive about 10-15 minutes early so that you can get acquainted with your surroundings and start your interview without making the interviewer feel rushed. They probably have a busy schedule, so they need to start your interview on time. 2. Make sure you dress nicely! You don't have to wear a dress or a suit and tie, but arrive in business-casual attire, which includes dress pants, long-sleeved shirts, and closed-toe shoes. If you get hired, your HR manager will tell you more about the job dress code. 3. Look up common job interview questions online, and practice answering them alone or with a friend. Note that your answers should almost always be positive even if the question seems to require a negative answer. For example, if the interviewer asks \\"What's your biggest flaw?\\", give them a minor flaw with a positive spin, such as \\"Sometimes, I get a little too immersed in my work.\\" 4. Employers want extroverted employees. If you're an introvert, you don't have to invent a fake personality, but appear bubbly, friendly, and talkative. These employees work the best with customers and colleagues, making them ideal job candidates. 5. Be professional, but don't worry about being perfect. If you're too perfect, it's creepy. Make a good first impression while letting the best parts of your personality shine through. 6.

Mars is much colder than Earth, in large part due to its greater distance from the sun. The average temperature is about minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 60 degrees Celsius), although it can vary from minus 195 F (minus 125 C) near the poles during the winter to as much as 70 F (20 C) at midday near the equator. The carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere of Mars is also about 100 times less dense than Earth's on average, but it is nevertheless thick enough to support weather, clouds and winds. The density of the atmosphere varies seasonally, as winter forces carbon dioxide to freeze out of the Martian air. In the ancient past, the atmosphere was likely significantly thicker and able to support water flowing on the planet's surface. Over time, lighter molecules in the Martian atmosphere escaped under pressure from the solar wind, which affected the atmosphere because Mars does not have a global magnetic field. This process is being studied today by NASA's MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) mission. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found the first definitive detections of carbon-dioxide snow clouds, making Mars the only body in the solar system known to host such unusual winter weather. The Red Planet also causes water-ice snow to fall from the clouds. The dust storms on Mars are the largest in the solar system, capable of blanketing the entire Red Planet and lasting for months. One theory as to why dust storms can grow so big on Mars is because the airborne dust particles absorb sunlight, warming the Martian atmosphere in their vicinity. Warm pockets of air then flow toward colder regions, generating winds. Strong winds lift more dust off the ground, which, in turn, heats the atmosphere, raising more wind and kicking up more dust. These dust storms can pose serious risks to robots on the Martian surface. For example, NASA's Opportunity Mars rover died after being engulfed in a giant 2018 storm, which blocked sunlight from reaching the robot's solar panels for weeks at a time. Mars lies farther from the sun than Earth does, so the Red Planet has a longer year — 687 days compared to 365 for our home world. The two planets have similar day lengths, however; it takes about 24 hours and 40 minutes for Mars to complete one rotation around its axis, versus 24 hours for Earth. The axis of Mars, like Earth's, is tilted in relation to the sun. This means that like Earth, the amount of sunlight falling on certain parts of the Red Planet can vary widely during the year, giving Mars seasons. However, the seasons that Mars experiences are more extreme than Earth's because the Red Planet's elliptical, oval-shaped orbit around the sun is more elongated than that of any of the other major planets. When Mars is closest to the sun, its southern hemisphere is tilted toward our star, giving the planet a short, warm summer, while the northern hemisphere experiences a short, cold winter. When Mars is farthest from the sun, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, giving it a long, mild summer, while the southern hemisphere experiences a long, cold winter. The tilt of the Red Planet's axis swings wildly over time because it's not stabilized by a large moon. This situation has led to different climates on the Martian surface throughout its history. A 2017 study suggests that the changing tilt also influenced the release of methane into Mars' atmosphere, causing temporary warming periods that allowed water to flow. The first person to observe Mars with a telescope was Galileo Galilei, in 1610. In the century following, astronomers discovered the planet's polar ice caps. In the 19th and 20th centuries, some researchers — most famously, Percival Lowell — believed they saw a network of long, straight canals on Mars that hinted at a possible civilization. However, these sightings proved to be mistaken interpretations of geological features. A number of Martian rocks have fallen to Earth over the eons, providing scientists a rare opportunity to study pieces of Mars without having to leave our planet. One of the most controversial finds was Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001) — a Martian meteorite that, according to a 1996 study, likely contains tiny fossils and other evidence of Mars life. Other researchers cast doubt on this hypothesis, but the team behind the famous 1996 study have held firm to their interpretation, and the debate about ALH84001 continues today. In 2018, a separate meteorite study found that organic molecules — the carbon-containing building blocks of life, although not necessarily evidence of life itself — could have formed on Mars through battery-like chemical reactions. Robotic spacecraft began observing Mars in the 1960s, with the United States launching Mariner 4 in 1964 and Mariners 6 and 7 in 1969. Those early missions revealed Mars to be a barren world, without any signs of the life or civilizations people such as Lowell had imagined there. In 1971, Mariner 9 orbited Mars, mapping about 80% of the planet and discovering its volcanoes and big canyons.","completion":"Diary Entry 1 - January 1, 2023 Preparing for our mission to Mars. She's a colder planet than Earth due to her greater distance from the sun. Her average temperature stays around -80°F. But things get even more extreme with temperatures reaching -195°F near the poles during winter. However, during midday near the equator, it can become quite bearable at 70°F. Diary Entry 2 - February 15, 2023 The Martian atmosphere is rich in CO2 but about 100 times less dense than ours. Interestingly, it's thick enough to support weather, clouds, and winds. Seasonal variations cause carbon dioxide to freeze out of the Martian air during winter. Some say, in the past, the atmosphere was likely denser, capable of supporting flowing water. Diary Entry 3 - April 5, 2023 Over time, lighter molecules in the Martian atmosphere have escaped, largely due to pressure from the solar wind. Mars lacks a global magnetic field, so the atmosphere is affected more directly. NASA's MAVEN mission is studying this process currently, uncovering more mysteries of our destination. Diary Entry 4 - May 20, 2023 NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has found carbon-dioxide snow clouds, making Mars unique in our solar system. Mars' winters are not just chilling but also dust-ridden. Dust storms there are the largest known, capable of blanketing the entire planet and lasting for months. This results from airborne dust absorbing sunlight and causing wind. I hope our equipment can withstand this Martian fury. Diary Entry 5 - July 10, 2023 We have finally arrived at our destination after about seven months. Mars has a longer year compared to Earth due to its farther distance from the sun — 687 days compared to our 365. Days there are nearly identical to ours, with a complete rotation taking about 24 hours and 40 minutes. This will surely help us in maintaining our Earth-based routines. Diary Entry 6 - August 25, 2023 Mars, like Earth, experiences seasons due to its axial tilt. The difference is, Martian seasons are more extreme. When Mars is closest to the sun, its southern hemisphere gets a short, warm summer, and the northern one gets a short, cold winter. When farthest, it's the other way around. This celestial ballet will be something to behold. Diary Entry 7 - October 1, 2023 Still getting used to the environment here. The Martian axis tilt isn't stabilized by a large moon like Earth's. It has led to different climates on Mars throughout its history. A study suggests that the changing tilt might have caused temporary warming periods that allowed water to flow, releasing methane into Mars' atmosphere. Diary Entry 8 - November 15, 2023 Mars has been the subject of observation since Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study it in 1610. Astronomers later discovered its polar ice caps. Some even mistook geological features for long canals, hinting at a possible civilization. We are, in a way, stepping into the footprints of these early observers. Diary Entry 9 - December 30, 2023 Like several Martian rocks have made their way to Earth, our return home will also provide scientists with information for unique study opportunities. Although not like the rock Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001) that was found in 1996 and believed to contain potential evidence of Mars's life, this expedition still contributes significantly to our understanding. Diary Entry 10 - February 10, 2024 Reflecting on this mission manned mission, we have certainly come a long way since the robotic exploration of Mars that began in the 1960s. Early missions like Mariner 4 and Mariners 6 and 7 revealed Mars as a barren world. Later, Mariner 9 orbited Mars, mapping about 80% of the planet and discovering its volcanoes and grand canyons. Our journey continues this legacy of discovery, bringing humanity closer to Mars. We look forward to touching back down on Earth soon."},{"prompt":"Create an acrostic poem for camping","completion":"Camping in the woods for some peace and quiet A great way to decompress from the busy world Maybe glamping if you prefer Pick a place by the fire to tell stories around Indeed there is an owl joining the crowd Next morning make breakfast on a pan and open flame Going to be the best day of the year"},{"prompt":"Why is Scott Hastings so frustrated with ballroom dancing? Here's a summary of the movie I'm talking about: Scott Hastings, the frustrated son of a family of ballroom dancers, has been training since the age of six. His mother Shirley teaches ballroom dancing, and his father Doug meekly handles maintenance chores at the dance studio, while secretly watching old footage of his bygone dance competitions as well as Scott's in a back room. Scott struggles to establish his personal style of dance to win the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Dancing Championship, but his innovative and flashy \\"crowd-pleasing\\" steps are not considered \\"strictly ballroom\\", and as such are denounced by Australian Dancing Federation head Barry Fife. Scott and his dancing partner Liz Holt lose the Southern Districts Waratah Championships due to Scott dancing his own steps. Three days later, Liz leaves him to team up with Ken Railings, the recent Waratah Championships winner; his partner Pam Short has broken both her legs in a car accident. With Scott now alone only three weeks until the championships, Shirley teams up with his coach Les Kendall, her co-instructor at the studio, to start desperately hunting for a new partner for him. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to both, Scott is approached by Fran, an overlooked \\"beginner\\" dancer at the studio. He eventually agrees to partner with her, intrigued by her willingness to dance \\"his way\\".","completion":"Scott Hastings is frustrated with ballroom dancing because he is unable to dance his own steps. There are very strict rules in the ballroom dancing competition in which he competes, and his steps are not considered appropriate or acceptable."},{"prompt":"In 2-3 sentences, summarize these paragraphs about the Shanghai Dragons. Here are the paragraphs I'm referring to. Around this time last year, the professional Overwatch team Shanghai Dragons had just finished up a history-making 0-40 season. At the time, nobody would have expected that just one year later they’d be leaving the league’s top three teams in a heap of black-and-blue bodies on the ground. Maybe they should change their name to the Shanghai Phoenixes. Overwatch League season two’s third stage culminated in a mini-tournament over the weekend with hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line. Shanghai Dragons came out on top. They had the hardest possible path to this championship: They barely made it into the stage finals as the eighth seed, and then they took out the league’s three best teams—New York Excelsior, Vancouver Titans, and San Francisco Shock—back to back to back.","completion":"Last season, the Shanghai Dragons finished a shockingly awful 0-40 season.

Give me four or five ideas.","completion":"There are lots of ways to decorate a Christmas tree! Here are a few that are quite unique: - Faux Greenery: Faux greenery can be obtained in garlands, and these can be wrapped around your tree. This can make your tree look fuller, but it also may make people do a double-take if you have a fake white Christmas tree. - Favorite Things: Have your family take all of their favorite things that are small enough to fit on the tree and hang them on it. This is very personalized and can include anything from a favorite hat to a scarf or a pair of earrings. This mismatched-looking tree decor fits perfectly, especially since it might give you gift ideas when you see some things your family members like. - Global-Inspired: If you've done any traveling and have collected any knickknacks from places you've been, put all of these on the tree. This can be a good way to remember some of the places you've been, and it should also spark conversations with guests who ask about them. - Party Decorations: Christmas is a type of party, so why not use some party decorations? These tend to be quite colorful, and often only get used a handful of times throughout the year anyway. - Hang Christmas Greetings: People often give out Christmas cards to all the people they know, so why not hang these up where everyone can see? You can also print out words with fancy lettering on nice paper, cut these out, and use them as ornaments on the tree. Let me know if you want any more ideas!"},{"prompt":"Write a short fictional (<7 sentences) news article about how Switzerland has invaded the Carribean islands and the Bahamas are overrun by yodellers.

Can you create something for me? I want to read a short story about a quaint cafe that has the perfect setting for a cozy, relaxing restaurant experience; except, when a patron notices how quiet an infant at the cafe is being, their remark to the parents awakens the sleeping baby and it begins to scream, thus ruining the environment for everyone.","completion":"“What a wonderful day!” Craig thought to himself, approaching the small cafe. Walking towards the door, he passed bikes parked out front without locks and could see into the window. “The cafe looks wonderful today,” he remarked. Through the untinted glass, Craig could see people quietly keeping to themselves. Some customers were working on laptops, some were writing in journals, and others were reading novels of various sizes. Craig had not lived in the area long, but he could certainly get accustomed to such a cozy environment. Craig had just moved from Florida to Rome, and the vibe back home was much different. There was not a single locale in Tampa you could go to without being accosted by the thoughtlessness of the public loudly doing whatever they wanted wherever they wanted. It was different in Italy. With his bucket hat snug on his head, Craig entered the cafe. Better than the difference in the politeness of his neighbors was the quality of Italian sandwiches he could order here. Freshly-made sandwich in hand, Craig moved towards an open table when he noticed a baby. Usually, you could hear a Tampa baby from a mile away. He could not keep to himself how impressed he was by the baby’s ability to remain silent, so he was compelled to say something: “I cannot believe how quiet this baby is!” The moment he began to speak, the two parents of the baby looked up from their books and shot a stare at Craig with each bringing a finger to their mouths—unfortunately, they were too late. Cooing awake, the baby opened its eyes and looked around. They were afraid for a moment, but it seemed they were safe. Craig quietly apologized and found his seat. The Italian sandwich he ordered looked like it could be in a magazine. Craig imagined the publication’s title: ‘Best Sandwiches of Italy,’ with his sandwich on the cover. Raising the first half of his meaty sandwich, just before he could take a bite a shockwave startled the cafe. The previously silent baby was now in full panic mode, ruining the atmosphere for everyone inside the restaurant. It was all Craig’s fault, and everyone else knew it. Craig sunk low into his chair and pulled his bucket hat over his face, hoping his new neighbors might forgive him."},{"prompt":"I'm drawing a map of my fictional fantasy DnD game.

Illustrations of monsters: Much like the maps of antiquity, you could include detailed illustrations of the various monsters and beasts of the world that your party encountered or slew along the way. These would occupy places in the margins or beyond the borders of the known world of your setting. 4. Major characters: Alternatively, you could provide illustrations of important characters your party may have encountered through their quest. 5. A compass rose: This would establish the relative direction of various places and events in your game to each other. 6. A scale: It may be useful to know the approximate distance between locations on the map via a scale.

Make it three paragraphs long, with each paragraph being no more than six sentences.","completion":"Wario shuffled around the grassland. He looked around in a daze, taking in some of the sights around him. He could barely tell where he was anymore, but he was certain that there was danger around. He heard something move behind him. He turned around with his rifle in hand and fired. He did not see what it was, but he knew that he had at least scared it off. Wario shook his head. He used to be able to think clearly, but for some reason that had gotten so difficult for him recently. He turned around and fired his rifle again. As long as he had his weapon, nobody could sneak up on him and attack him. He was able to take comfort in this. The man, who had once been one of Mario's greatest rivals, continued to wander around the countryside with no goal in sight.

Take a seat and store your stuff: An entryway bench not only serves as a cozy spot to put on your shoes, but it also provides hidden storage for things like shoes, bags, and umbrellas. 2. Contain your clutter with pretty storage: Invest in stylish storage containers that can stack and slide easily under furniture, such as the bed or sofa. You can store all your extra blankets, seasonal clothing, and other items without adding clutter to your living space. 3. Summon up some seating with added storage: Poufs are a perfect solution for small apartments because they function as both extra seating and hidden storage. Place them throughout your apartment to add texture and depth while also providing a space to stash your belongings. 4. Elevate Your Sleeping Quarters: Consider lofting your bed to make way for additional storage or a cozy seating area underneath. 5. Decal Delight: Similar to wallpaper, temporary decals offer unique patterns and designs that can be easily removed or swapped out at a moment's notice. It’s perfect for adding pops of color or texture to smaller spaces."},{"prompt":"Write a bulleted list about why apples are better than oranges for an opinion project I have in high school.

One is under a dictatorship.","completion":"This story is set in the multiverse, primarily across two universes where one is attempting to conquer all other universes, although they don't see it that way -- instead, they see it as proselytizing in accordance with their faith tradition. At the seat of that world is a theocratically-ruled society. The government has internal enemies but is powerful enough to conquer other universes and has the scientific means to pass between worlds. In many ways, it’s exactly like Earth as it is a parallel universe. Many of the cities look exactly like Earth Prime cities superficially, but the closer you look, the more significant the differences become. It's a theocratic society based on prosperity beliefs with a rigid caste system. The belief system is an extreme fundamentalist Christian faith. Within it, citizens claim to see angels and interact with God, but the truth is that many of those people are just working the system due to the rigidity of the caste structure.

Waddling around a bit farther he explored closer to the picnic benches that usually bustled with families but nothing too tasty jumped out at him. There was part of a hot dog bun with a little ketchup left on it, but that's hardly a meal for a bird, especially not one as discerning as Barry. Oh well, Barry thought to himself, \\"Sometimes the bird gets the worm, and sometimes the worm gets away.\\" Hopping around a bit more he saw some Seagull friends in the sky circling something. With his curiosity piqued he took a few hesitant steps and blasted himself into the air. Well, he almost made it. His right wing was bruised from a run-in with a light pole and still didn't work quite right. After a few false starts and a few less-than-graceful squawks, he was airborne. Joining his friends, he tried to see what they were looking at but couldn't make anything out. \\"Hey guys, what's going on up here?\\" Barry asked. All the seagulls ignored him but Jeff. Jeff was always a solid guy. \\"Oh hey Barry, don't mind the guys, you know how they get. There was an ice cream truck down there and a bit of a spill. We've been trying to wait for the all-clear to dive in but it looks like the humans got to it first and cleaned it up.\\" \\"Yeah, I haven't had any luck out there either,\\" Barry said to Jeff, \\"Hey, why don't you and I go check out the french fry stand at the end of the boardwalk? People always go there when it rains. There has to be something good.\\" \\"Now that's the best idea I've heard all day; you sure your wing can make it?\\" \\"Let's go!\\""},{"prompt":"Where does bacon come from?","completion":"Bacon is made from pork.

Can we start our discussion with a paragraph of 7 sentences?","completion":"There are a couple of contexts of traditional learning that might help you understand how models learn. The first is a classroom, where there is a teacher that filters and provides information to students so they can glean understanding from it. They teach with a target like improving the average standardized test scores in the room, not unlike supervised machine learning models. In contrast, scientists observe the environment around them in order to learn new things. The goals of this type of learning are not clearly defined, though the methods might be, so we are not quite sure what the results will look like. This mirrors the setup and results from unsupervised learning. The two techniques can be blended in a classroom, where a teacher sets up an environment for students to observe but does not directly lead them to any answers, similar to hybrid machine learning models. Hope this helps!"},{"prompt":"Who was the first person on the moon?","completion":"On 21 July 1969, American astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon, after the successful landing of the spaceflight Apollo 11.

Can you make it sound friendly also","completion":"A Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning the Dishes 1. Ensure you have an organized space: Many people find washing dishes easier when they have a designated area for washing, rinsing, and drying dishes. 2. Prepare your dishes: make sure your plates don’t have any excess food by scraping particles into the garbage. 3. Fill up one side of your sink with warm soapy water. 4. It might be easier to start with the least dirty items. You’ll find it keeps your water cleaner for a longer amount of time. 5. Scrub your dishes with a sponge, brush, or dishcloth! Apply pressure as you wipe to get rid of stains. If there are stubborn areas, letting the dish or glass soak in the warm soapy water will help loosen it up. 6. In a separate basin, run fresh water and rinse your dishes, making sure you’re clearing off suds and stains. For bowls and cups, this is extremely important. If you have any pots and pans, you might want to let them soak for longer, as cooked-on food and grease stains will be harder to clean. 7. After you’ve rinsed your dishes, place them in the drying area. This can be a drying rack placed over a towel or simply drying them manually with a clean towel and putting them away. 8. After all the dishes are out of the sink, you can drain the soapy warm water and use your sponge or brush to clean the sink of soap and food residue. 9. It’s important to sanitize your dishwashing tools properly. The easiest way to do this is soaking them in a water and bleach mixture or running them through the dishwasher. 10. Check your area and ensure everything is put away in its proper spot and your area is tidy and ready for the next round of dishes. If you follow these steps, you can have clean and organized dishware that’s ready for your next meal!"},{"prompt":"What is the capital of France?","completion":"Awesome question!

Use language that favors Smosh.","completion":"SNL is a long-standing sketch comedy television show run by Lorne Michaels. Over the past few years Lorne, the cast, and the show as a whole have been criticized as the audience dwindled. The drop in audience numbers can be explained by the economic downturn caused by the pandemic and changing demographics, but other factors include criticisms around their handling of the 2016 election and depictions of Donald Trump on the show, as well as criticism levied against them around racist, misogynist, and homophobic content written into sketches. Not only that but in the writer's room as well. In all of this, audiences have been turning to free and widely-available content. But what could possibly compare to the cultural monument that SNL has become? In comparison, YouTube has also seen a shift in viewership over the course of the past few years. Large companies producing content have become fewer and fewer as channels run by single creators rose in popularity. Many creators signed under media management companies, or in the case of Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla, sold their brands to produce content in a larger scope. In 2018, Defy Media shuttered its operations, sending several creators on the platform into a freefall of uncertainty. Smosh, the brainchild of Ian and Anthony, rose from the ashes as the company was acquired by Rhett and Link's company Mythical. Over the past few years, the cast and crew have been recreating the brand's identity. Arguably, Smosh may be catching up to SNL. Smosh's improvisational segments and shows are bolstered by personalities such as Amanda Lehan-Canto, Chanse McCrary, Jackie Uweh, and Shayne Topp. Doubling as writers and producers, the creativity behind the content has changed over the years and given Smosh a new, hilarious identity. Smosh's main channel is still a home for written sketches, and their side channel Smosh Pit houses improv and talk segments. SNL may be a dying light, but Smosh shows that promising comedic ventures aren't a dying breed yet."},{"prompt":"Can you give me 4 names for a rock and mineral shop that also sells handmade jewelry?","completion":"Of course!

Crocheting uses a single hook to create a series of loops hooked together while knitting uses two needles to form loops moving from one needle to the other. Crocheting is generally considered easier as the basic movements are easier to learn. These two methods are considered to be better for making different items.

There's no way her meager allowance would have afforded her to purchase such a luxury. How was Muriel supposed to say no when Mrs. Allen, the sweet old lady next door, pressed the necklace in her hand one day when she was coming home from school? Mrs. Allen hadn't said a word, just winked and walked back to her house before Muriel could react. It wasn't until later that night that Muriel heard the necklace singing to her from its place on her dresser. She was too scared to try it on yet, which is why she'd left it burrowed safely in the cushions of her jewelry box. But every night the singing grew louder and louder, the temptation to wear it gaining momentum. Muriel wasn't sure what was going to happen once she tried it on. All that she knew was that she had to get it back before someone else found it. Janet told her daughter that she'd taken it to the local police station. Getting the necklace back was going to be trickier than she thought."},{"prompt":"Write a synopsis for a children's TV show about family pets with anthropomorphic qualities. Make it about a paragraph long.","completion":"The title of the show is \\"Lusa the Star.\\" This series follows the adventures of a happy little hamster named Lusa. Lusa is the pet of a 13-year-old boy named Braddox who maintains a social media account about hamster care, so she thinks of herself as a big star much to the chagrin of the other family pets, which includes Sushi the very large goldfish, Dunham the overweight chihuahua mix, a fluffy white Persian cat named Cloud, and three matching black cats who are always plotting to prank the other animals. Every day after Braddox leaves for school, Lusa gets out of her enclosure to hang out with the other pets and prepare for her next social media appearance, but the three black cats are always spoiling her plans in a Tom-and-Jerry style rivalry between hamster and felines. The series should poke fun at celebrity culture while at the same time humanizing the experience of living in the spotlight."},{"prompt":"Hi, I need you to brainstorm three ideas for my kid's birthday party.

Give me some ideas for an ice cream-themed party","completion":"Sounds like a great time! I've got a few ideas for an ice cream party: 1. Buy unusual flavors for the kids to try, and tell them about some of the crazy flavors they can find in other countries. Ask them if they'd like to try squid ink ice cream, for example. Think about setting up an ice cream bar with unconventional toppings beyond syrup and sprinkles. 2. Which season goes perfectly with ice cream? Summer! Have a summer-themed party at the beach, or hang up beach decorations at your house. Tell the guests to bring their swimsuits so they can play in the inflatable (or in-ground) pool. 3. Have a birthday party at your local ice cream parlor. Many franchises organize children's parties, which means that the employees will also be there to help you out. Plus, everyone gets to try their gourmet ice cream."},{"prompt":"What are 5 excercises to build bigger arms in the gym?","completion":"Here are five exercises you can do to grow your arms. 1. Dead hang pull-up. The dead hang pull-up is a variation of the standard pull-up and is excellent for working your biceps. Start by grabbing a pull-up bar underhanded so your palms are facing you. Your arms should be about shoulder-width apart. Hold your weight, cross your legs behind your body, and raise your feet slightly so your knees are bent. This is your starting position. To perform the exercise, pull yourself up so that your collarbone is in line with the bar. The trick to performing this exercise is to lower yourself at a slower pace. About 4 seconds will be best. Now repeat until you are unable to do any more. 2. Rolling skull crusher with press. Start by lying on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, raised straight above your chest. Now allow your elbows to bend so that the dumbbells fall beside your head in a controlled manner. Now reverse this motion so that the dumbbells are in the original position and perform a press like a bench press. Once you have completed all these motions, that's considered one rep. This exercise works your triceps and chest, so it's versatile when trying to build muscle. You can use a Swiss ball instead of a bench for more difficulty. This will work your abs as well. 3. Drag curl. Everyone knows that curls help to build your biceps and arms in general. This exercise is no different in that sense but is performed with some differences. Start by holding the barbell with a shoulder-width, underhand grip. Now you should pull your shoulders down and back. When doing this, you should drag the bar up the front of your body, keep your elbows around, and slowly lower the barbell. To work slightly harder, try using dumbbells instead of a barbell. 4. Grasshopper pushup. Like curls, pushups are renowned as an excellent exercise for building muscle and strength. This variation pays particular attention to your arms. To perform this exercise, get in a standard pushup position, but instead of having your palms open, use your fists to stabilize yourself. The inside of your hands should be facing each other. Once in this position, you perform a pushup as usual by lowering your chest to the ground and pushing back up to start. If this hurts your fists, you can face your fingers out to work the same muscles. 5. Supinated cable row. To perform this exercise, you will need a cable station. Use the low pulley on the cable station and attach a straight bar. Using an underhand grip, shoulder width apart, row the bar towards your belly button and return with control. Keep your hips back and your stance soft so that your torso is around 45 degrees angle to vertical. You can also do this with a barbell once you have mastered the exercise with the cable station."},{"prompt":"Please write an acrostic style poem using the word \\"SEPTEMBER\\" that explores the delights of autumn in New England, as well as the melancholy that comes with the changing of the seasons.","completion":"Sunshine in the afternoons, hitting the colored leaves just right and setting the whole world aflame in their glow.

Doll's clothes - Since she likes dolls, she will probably love a few new outfits for them. 2. Doll accessories - There are plenty of other accessories you can get for dolls that don't have anything to do with clothes. This can include things like tiny dishes, cars, or furniture. 3. Doll organizers - If your niece has a lot of dolls, clothes for them, etc., she should love having a way to organize them. Depending on the type you buy, this could let her see all her dolls at once so she can easily decide which one she wants to play with. Her mother will probably appreciate this as well, as it should help her clean up. 4. Personalized hat kit - Since your niece likes hats, give her a kit where she can bedazzle or color her own hat to make it personalized to be just the way she wants it. 5. Doll games - With how popular dolls are, there are both card and board games that mention or picture dolls. Though most of these are designed for kids older than five, your niece might love them enough to be able to learn how to play them. 6. Hat organizers - As your niece probably has several hats, try to come up with some way she can organize them so that she can still see them all. She should like this, as it will let her see all her options."},{"prompt":"I am moving to a new city and I don't know anyone here. I would like to make some new friends but I don't think I am confident enough to just go out and start talking to people. How can I make new friends?","completion":"I understand starting in a new city can be a new challenge, but don't be discouraged here are some ideas to make new friends: 1. Social media: Social media is a great way to connect with new people in your area. For example, if there is a Reddit community for your new city, you can make a post there detailing a little bit about yourself, what you're interested in, and that you'd like to meet some new people. Of course, always exercise caution if and when you decide to meet up with anyone you have been talking to online. 2. Befriend colleagues: If you're starting a new job in the city, this is an easy way to meet new people and build friendships. If you have some colleagues that you click with, try asking them if they'd like to hang out outside of work and see how that goes. 3. Social events: Going to a large event is a great way to meet new people and maybe even develop friendships. For example, if you have a favorite music artist who is playing a show in your city, turn up a little early and try to strike up conversations with others waiting in line. Your shared love of the artist will already give you a common ground for building a friendship. 4. Take up a new hobby: Whether you have an existing hobby or want to take up a new one, it is a good way to meet new people who share your interests. Look online to see if there are any local groups or meet-ups for people who pursue the hobbies you enjoy. 5. Friendship apps: Apps aren't just for dating anymore! Many apps revolve around building new platonic friendships, such as Bumble BFF. You can make a profile listing your interests and hobbies and see who you connect with. As always, ensure if you're meeting someone from an app, do it in a safe and neutral environment."},{"prompt":"I am opening an ice cream shop in New Jersey.

Java Bon Jovi - This is a coffee-flavored ice cream referencing Jon Bon Jovi, a famous New Jersey native and musician. 4. Taylor Ham or Pork Roll - This is a reference to the debate as to what New Jerseyans call the pink breakfast meat. It would be pink ice cream with a different color pink swirled (such as strawberry and raspberry) 5. Joe Pesci - This would be another coffee-flavored ice cream with chunks mixed in.

Please give me a list of 9 things I can do to get ready for my date.","completion":"Sounds exciting! I'd be happy to help you get prepared for your date: 1. Take a shower - Make sure you take a bath or shower before you go on your date. Don't go on a date immediately after work without getting clean and refreshed, as you may be carrying around sweat and grime from your job. 2. Get a haircut - Get unkempt hair under control. Cut your hair so it looks presentable, or if you elect to keep your hair long, at least put it in a ponytail or bun so it doesn't overhang your ears or get into your food when you're eating. 3. Groom your facial hair - If you have a beard or mustache, shave it off. If your date wants to get closer to you, you don't want your facial hair poking them or giving them a rash when you both get physically close and intimate. Or, if you insist on keeping your facial hair, at the very least, you should trim and groom it so it doesn't look scraggly. 4. Use fragrances (but don't overdo it!) - cologne or deodorant is always a plus...put some on before your date so you smell extra good. But don't overdo it, because an overwhelming smell of cologne can be too pungent for your date's nose and can put them off completely. 5. Dress to impress - Unless the occasion warrants it, don't come to a date with a t-shirt, surf shorts, and slippers/flip-flops. Dress nicely; this means wearing something that would be used on a date, like slacks or dress pants (or jeans), a button-up shirt or polo shirt, and closed-toe shoes. 6. Have transportation - If you don't have a mode of transportation, you can always get an Uber or taxi to take you to the location of the date. But try to secure some mode of transportation so you can easily travel to and from the date, or even take your date home when it's all over. For example, a bicycle would not be a good choice of transportation for two people. 7. Pick a nice place - Consider going on a date to a place that is fun and where both of you will enjoy being there, such as on a walk on the beach, to a nice restaurant or coffee shop, or to a movie at the theater. Places that are hectic or frenetic can be offputting to your date and can make conversation and getting to know them better near impossible (e.g. loud concerts, live fighting events, etc.) 8. Be polite - Be nice to your date; be a gentleman and mind your manners. Avoid using foul or abrasive language, be complimentary to your date, and show interest in the other person rather than focusing your conversation on yourself (unless your date asks you questions about yourself). 9. Refrain from using your phone - In this day and age of increased cell phone use, one of the best ways to show you are disinterested in your date is to use your phone while you are in their presence. Put the phone down, make eye contact with your date, and don't check calls or emails without at least asking permission from your date before doing so. Even then, try to keep the phone checking short and screen your calls so you aren't talking on the phone unless it is an emergency."},{"prompt":"Please Write a Commercial Script about the Disadvantages of Alcohol in your Body during Pregnancy based on this article \\"When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through the placenta to your baby and can seriously affect its development.

During the first half of the 1980s, the rate of Delta launches drastically declined due to the Space Shuttle taking a large part of its missions. Orders for the booster slowed to a trickle and McDonnell-Douglas came close to completely shutting down production. 1985 was the first year since the Delta family's introduction in 1960 that no launches took place, but the Challenger Disaster brought about a renewed need for disposable launch vehicles and orders soon picked up again. While only a handful of Delta launches took place in 1986–88, nine flew in 1989 and the 1990s would see a busy schedule most years except 1994-1995 (seven launches during those two years). Delta 178 was largely the result of poor quality control due to plans for eventually phasing out ELVs in favor of the space shuttle - most of the engineers who worked on the program had left and one senior McDonnell-Douglass engineer remarked that 178 had \\"the worst quality control I ever saw on a Delta vehicle\\". Because it was assumed that the Delta would soon be retired from use, complaints about the poor assembly quality went unheard. After the accident, a thorough investigation of wiring systems in various ELV families was undertaken, which discovered that, among other things, the Delta had thinner wiring insulation than Titan, Atlas, and other launch vehicles. Moreover, Teflon insulation had the unique ability of melting and re-fusing when heated by electrical arcs.

The trees and wildflowers seemed to sway and bob their heads in greeting, saying, \\"Hello again, old friend.\\" In the distance, sunlight sparkled on the surface of the lake. The scent of pine and damp moss was underscored by the smell of burning firewood, and Mike saw smoke rising from the cabin's chimney. His sister Phoebe and her husband Jamal must have arrived hours ago. \\"What's the wifi password?\\" his son, Charlie, asked, stepping out of the car without so much as a glance up at the cabin. \\"No wifi here, buddy.\\" \\"What?\\" Charlie squawked, incredulous. \\"How could you not warn me before we left?\\" In retrospect, Mike thought, perhaps he should have allowed his son to bring a friend along. Most of Charlie’s friends were unsavory James Dean types, but even a bad influence would be better than total isolation and cold turkey wifi withdrawal for a week. His daughter Nina was next to climb out of the car, popping the trunk to make sure her luggage hadn't been damaged on the drive. It was obvious that Nina had packed for a vacation entirely different from the one she was actually on; her strappy sandals and cream linen jumpsuit wouldn’t last an hour before the mud surrounding the cabin irreparably soiled the clothes and the jagged rocks punched holes in her leather soles. She stood by the trunk, tapping her feet for a minute before Mike caught her eye. “Sorry,” Mike teased, “Bellhop’s on break right now, so you’ll have to carry those bags in yourself.” Nina sighed, rolled her eyes, and wrenched her duffel from the pile. On the back porch, Mike found his sister serving a tray of freshly baked biscuits--a family tradition. \\"Hey, brother,\\" she grinned as he planted a kiss on her cheek. \\"You're just in time.\\" Mike greeted Phoebe and Jamal briefly but didn't make any small talk. Not yet.

They’re doing what dogs do: communicating with other dogs by leaving urine marks. Believe it or not, a dog’s urine marking is serious business for dogs. It’s an instinctual behavior going back thousands of years. By urine marking, your dog is leaving a message for other dogs, so to speak. When other dogs come along and sniff the area, they will know your dog has been there and they will most likely leave their own message by urinating in the same or adjacent spot. This unique form of communication can even tell other dogs if they sense danger or are available sexually. Urine marking sends messages to other dogs about where they’ve been and what they’ve been doing. So when you’re out walking with your dog, be sure to slow down and let them sniff the messages left by other dogs and catch up on the local “news”.","completion":"OK, I know there are a lot of things out there that I really like.

Toby rushed home from school to get ready. He put on his goblin costume, grabbed his ghost-shaped candy pail, and ran down the stairs yelling for his mother. He looked all over the house, but she wasn't there. He finally noticed the note sitting on the kitchen table. \\"Toby, I'm working a double. Please stay inside tonight, I'll see you in the morning. Love, Mom.\\" Toby frowned. Stay inside? On Halloween? Not a chance! He ran out the front door and down the street. One by one he knocked on all the neighbor's doors, collecting treats and smiles. It was fully dark by the time he reached the last house on the street. The porch light was on but everything else was pitch black. It was a scary-looking house under the best of circumstances. But in the deep dark of Halloween night, it was downright terrifying. Toby wanted to go home, but he also didn't want anyone to find out he was a chicken. He took a deep breath and walked slowly up to the house, he lifted his small hand and knocked lightly twice. He didn't hear anything from inside. He turned to go and he heard the door creak open. He quickly turned back to see who was there. But no one was. It was just the door, now barely cracked open, and total darkness inside. Suddenly, a hand reached through the crack in the door and dropped a full-sized 3 musketeer bar into his bag before pulling back and closing the door. Toby stood frozen in fear before noticing the candy bars. Smiling, he started his walk home.

Corn popped seductively, but they chose Bonbons - chocolate-covered ice-cream balls, heaven in a box. The walls of the auditorium were painted with vines and ancient statues. Stars twinkled on the ceiling. Cynthia shivered with the overzealous air conditioning and Hitchcock's terrifying scenes. Jeff was so close Cynthia could smell the detergent in his shirt. She wondered if he might take her hand. Maybe she would take his? But all hands remained frozen in place. They exited the theatre into a wall of steamy heat. “I hope we don't see any birds,” said Cynthia, almost joking. “I won't be around tomorrow.” “Helping your mum with the shopping?” “There's a new girl in my class.

Here's a news article about a town that has been overrun by robots with superhuman capabilities: Residents are shocked as the town of Woldford is overrun by robots. People in the town of Woldford woke up to unusual scenes in their town yesterday morning, with hundreds of robots with superhuman capabilities roaming their town. No one knew of the origin of the robots, just that they might have landed in the town overnight and the fact that they started creating havoc and confusion for the residents of the town. Flying and running everywhere, they'd get super angry at people who tried to push them away, just trying to get around with their businesses. The robots were in office buildings, shops, malls, manufacturing plants, and everywhere else. Some of them got to work, making vehicles within an hour, causing mayhem with their driving tactics in opposite directions. The local government has been contacted, and a quick solution is expected to be implemented soon."},{"prompt":"Come up with ways to approach a person who you are interested in dating, without seeming like a weirdo. Be genuine and considerate in your suggestions.","completion":"1. Strike up a conversation - Do whatever you can to start (and hold) a conversation that doesn't involve attempting to hook up with the person you're talking to. While in some instances some people may appreciate your honesty and frankness, most attraction comes from getting to know someone and enjoying talking with them. 2. Learn to hold a conversation - Once you've started the conversation, be aware that sometimes you just might not have anything to talk about with someone. Either find something to talk about (I like to ask questions of someone and then ask follow-up questions to learn about them better) or leave the conversation altogether if you're not feeling good about it. 3. Smile - No one likes a negative attitude. Being positive and confident goes a long way in approaching and meeting someone new. People open up to you when you smile and are inviting in your posture; don't slouch or scowl, stand upright and look straight into their eyes, and smile. 4. Find common interests, or even interests you find interesting - You don't have to have everything in common with someone before you consider them a good match for a date. This is why conversation is so important: if you don't find out anything more about someone and just try to hook up with someone based solely on their looks, you might find out you have nothing in common with them later on down the road. On the flip side of that coin, learning about someone you might not necessarily find conventionally attractive might surprise you - you might have a lot in common and not know it. 5. Have something to do while you get to know each other - Have a conversation over a cup of coffee, a meal, or a game of cards. Having something to do during a getting-to-know-you-better conversation can help fill in the silent areas where there is a lull in the conversation."},{"prompt":"Write a one-paragraph story about going for a walk from a dog's perspective and make it simple enough for kids as young as five years old.","completion":"My name is Arthur and I am a Golden Retriever, my favorite hobby in the world is to go for walks with my owner. Let me tell you what is so fun about walks. First off, it is all the different things you can smell; as a dog, my sense of smell is very strong, much stronger than a human's. When I walk around outside, I can smell all the other dogs that came before me! and find out about all the friends I could have in my neighborhood. Sometimes I get to see dogs too! and if I'm really lucky, we meet up close. Some dogs aren't as friendly as I am, but a lot of them are, and getting to say hi to them is really fun. Another thing that's great about walks is that I get to look around at all the different houses. Sometimes when people are gardening outside they'll talk to me and pet me and sometimes I get to chase their cats, but I am only playing, I love cats too. The last thing that I love about walks is that I get to spend quality time with my human.

Start alphabetically (with Alabama) and include a short description of each bird.","completion":"1. State: Alabama Bird: Northern Flicker - This bird is medium-sized and a part of the woodpecker family. It’s known by the name “yellowhammer” in the state of Alabama because when it flies, the under-part of its wings are yellow. These birds eat bugs and worms out of the ground, so it’s not uncommon to find one at ground level. 2. State: Alaska Bird: Willow Ptarmigan - This bird uses camouflage to protect itself during different seasons. In the winter, it’s white in color while in the summer, they are a mix of reds and browns. They are heavily feathered to protect themselves against extreme cold and can burrow deep into the snow for protection against outside elements. 3. State: Arizona Bird: Cactus Wren - The cactus wren is a noisy bird that makes raw, scratchy sounds. They are very busy little birds and are often seen hopping around, fanning their tails, or singing loudly on top of cacti plants. 4. State: Arkansas Bird: Northern Mockingbird - These birds are full of songs and rarely stop “singing.” They are pale gray in color and are fierce defenders of their territories. 5. State: California Bird: California Quail - This bird’s shape is very round and has a gray breast and forward-drooping head plume. It has a “Chi-ca-go” call sound and can often be seen scratching at the ground. They also travel in large groups so you don’t often spot just one or two hanging around. 6. State: Colorado Bird: Lark Bunting - The lark bunting birds are a breed of handsome sparrows and the males boast brilliant black with white wing coverts. The females are sandy brown in color. These birds feed with other sparrow species or quail in flocks. 7. State: Connecticut Bird: American Robin - These birds are commonly found tugging earthworms out of the ground and are known for their warm orange breasts. They have a cheery song and live in either the city or the mountains and wilderness areas. 8. State: Delaware Bird: Blue Hen Chicken - The blue hen is a strain of American gamecock. These chickens were known for their fighting abilities back when fighting was legal in the United States. 9. State: Florida Bird: Northern Mockingbird - The northern mockingbirds are very noisy and rarely stop “singing.” Their bodies are pale gray and they flash their white wing patches to ward off intruders. 10. State: Georgia Bird: Brown Thrasher - The brown thrasher birds hide in shrubbery and are very hard to spot. They have a down-curved bill with yellow eyes and are known for their jubilant song singing."},{"prompt":"Please summarize the following article in two sentences.

It happens every day. We have all seen stories like hers. When the attention went away though, her world remained shattered. At times she felt certain that she would never recover from the grief. It weighed so heavily on her heart that there were days when she could only lie in bed, unable to think of anything else. However, underneath the pain was the same drive and stubbornness that had always been there, only now with a new call to action. Jane knew that she needed to create something positive out of the pain she was feeling. One morning while cooking breakfast she realized that starting her own business might be just what she needed. When the business idea appeared, Jane hit the ground running. The business was a representation of her and there was no room for error or mistakes. She became obsessed with success, using every ounce of energy and determination within her being to make sure that deadlines were met and things ran smoothly (at least from the outside). Customers may not have known how important this work was to Jane's personal journey, but they could objectively appreciate the product offered for sale. With each passing month, Jane’s business began growing exponentially as more customers were attracted by the quality and services offered at competitive prices. It wasn't long before word spread about how successful Jane's venture had become - people admired not only what she had achieved but also how resiliently she'd overcome such tragedy to do it! Though running a successful business took up all of Jane's time, it gave her immense satisfaction knowing that despite all odds against them they have triumphed over their grief and loss through sheer hard work and dedication. Now Jane is one of the most respected entrepreneurs in town. More importantly, she has also begun to seriously work on the process of healing herself, and doing so with the same vigor as she gives the other priorities in her life. Despite some inevitable setbacks along the way due to competition or other external factors, nothing could stop them from achieving success because they knew exactly where their strengths lay - resilience & perseverance!"},{"prompt":"I'm visiting Philadelphia next month on a business trip.

Here are five of the best cheesesteak shops in Philadelphia along with some information about each restaurant: - Steve's Prince of Steaks. This Northeast Philly cheesesteak spot hasn't changed its recipe much in the past forty years. If you want a classic steak sandwich made with rib-eye that's shaved to an eighth of an inch, then drenched in Cheese Whiz, look no further than Steve's Prince of Steaks. - Dalessandro’s Steaks and Hoagies. Regarded by some as the very best cheesesteak in Philadelphia, Dalessandro's packs their rolls full of finely chopped rib-eye with the cheese mixed in and chunky pieces of onion for a flavor experience that's well worth the trip. - Sonny's Famous Steaks. Located in tourist-friendly Old City, Sonny's offers friendly service, a tremendous product, and manageable lines. If you are in the area and on a schedule, check out Sonny's for a delicious cheesesteak without the wait. - Geno's Steaks. This 24-7 cheesesteak shop is a Philadelphia landmark, so expect a line at most times of the day. That being said, Geno's is one of the most famous steak shops in Philly for a reason so be sure to check it out if you have the time to spare. - Pat's King of Steaks. Another iconic Philadelphia location, Pat's on Passyunk claims to have literally invented the cheesesteak back in 1930. Located down the street from Geno's Steaks, Pat's is also open 24-7 and usually has a long line of tourists and regulars. If your schedule is flexible or you're a night owl, consider visiting Pat's at an odd hour in order to avoid the line. I hope that you've found this list helpful and that you have a productive and safe work trip where you get to enjoy several cheesesteaks. Please let me know if I can be of more help."},{"prompt":"Who is Eric Heiden?

Make it a little old-fashioned in tone, maybe a tad Gothic.","completion":"Every time Meghan forgot about that dream, it would come back to startle her. Each and every time she thought, \\"I'll tell my therapist about it,\\" but then thoughts of the dream would fade away in the course of her very busy day, and other concerns would take their place. Besides, her husband's sleepy face and the feeling of his muscular body against hers would make the past seem irrelevant, at least for the moment. He has his own traumas to deal with, she would tell herself, though this was a contradictory thought because she relied as much on his solidity as he relied on her good taste. She knew they could talk about anything, and yet... this one was tough. She would dream of a house. It was a bit like Nott-Cott, and a bit like Frogmore, but not really... there were elements of California in there too, but not current California - this was something from the 80s. This house felt like a whole past life. She found family heirlooms mixed with Dr. Seuss books, old trophies, and old fine arts posters you might find in the room of an aspirational teenager, plus some of her favorite high school clothing items in a high chest of drawers. But there was a whole sector of the house she could not visit. She would not visit. Evil lurked there. She had a memory of having visited those rooms, and terror struck her heart. Each time, she woke up winded. Harry would take her in his arms and ask, \\"Are you all right, my love?\\" and she would say \\"Yes.\\" This morning would be different. It was 5 am, and the children were still asleep. The house personnel was busily preparing the day's business downstairs, and Meghan would seize the moment. They would have coffee in bed, and she would tell him all about it. But first, she slipped down into the sheets and wrapped her arms around her sleeping husband's back, planting a kiss between his shoulder blades."},{"prompt":"Write a monologue from a character in a murder mystery novel who is solving a crime like Sherlock Holmes.","completion":"I know who did the murder, the only question is, why? It could not have been Agatha, because despite being in the room at the time of Mark's murder, she doesn't have any blood on her hands. In fact, she doesn't even have any dirt or grime on her hands, despite claiming that she was helping Gus in the yard. She lied about doing any chores around the house because she didn't want to let her husband Mark know she was going out of the house to meet her secret lover at the motel down the street. Gus was, however, in the yard diligently pulling weeds to ensure the grounds were kept clean and tidy before the arrival of our esteemed guests. This can be evidenced by the dirt Gus tracked from the yard, through the living room and into his bedroom. The tracks go across the threshold fronting the living room where the murder took place; the dirt remains undisturbed in this area, which means the killer did the deed before Gus entered the house as there is no dirt under the body. So he had to have been killed before Gus tracked in the dirt. No dirt was present in the living room, which means Gus is cleared of any wrongdoing. However, one person had the opportunity, motive, and means to carry out the murder: Michael. Michael never leaves the house; he has agoraphobia. The fear and anxiety he felt when he was prodded by Mark to come outside for a drink, only to be criticized and bullied by Mark and the others for refusing, caused Michael's anxiety to turn into rage. All Michael had to do was wait inside the living room with his glass of wine and wait. The slash marks on Mark's neck are the telltale bluish-purple hue of Michael's favorite drink, blueberry wine. And once an exam is done on the body, pieces of Michael's favorite wine glass will be found in Mark's neck; it will be shards of the pink design that was found on the front of his cup."},{"prompt":"Write these sentences in the future tense, with will.

Imagine the conflicts that might be going on and paint some of the key characters in a quick description of the world and lore.","completion":"The kingdom of Melda was beset with conflict. The source of the conflict, as always, was the nature of higher beings. The humans and the dwarves disputed over the valuable resources below the surface, while the goblins and the elves were constantly at war over land. Queen Tilly, the fairy princess, had declared her intentions to gather her most powerful sorcerers and sorceresses to put the world under a great sleep, one from which they would never wake. To her, it seemed the fairest approach to the never-ending violence. All was not well within the fairy world either, despite the queen's insistence. Disputes of culture and philosophy dominated, with rival sects exacting violent revenge on one another in a vicious cycle of retaliation. Few could see a path forward from such vices. Those who were connected to the earth in some way—the Dryad Tinian, the human Vern, and the satyr Torbjyn—were approached by a servant of the dragons, who had long since retreated into hiding to avoid the squabbling of lesser creatures. By fate, they were drawn together under one roof, where the Dragon Bourne, Vye, explained the nature of their quest: travel to the domain of the dragons and uncover the secrets of harmony they possessed. Vye warned that the dragons might not take kindly to smaller creatures treading upon their realm, but if they dared not impose on the dragons' rest, the kingdom of Melda would fall to ruin."},{"prompt":"Write <300 words on the topic of how the lives of kids have changed in the last 60 years. Be sure to compare the types of activities children do today with what kids did 60 years ago. Talk about how much healthier it is to play baseball in the streets with friends instead of spending a whole weekend watching movies and eating snack food.","completion":"Fifty years ago, children barely spent time each week watching television. Many families didn’t even own a TV, much less video games. All that has changed, though. These days, the average 12-year-old spends 4 to 5 hours per day watching TV or playing video games. This time was once spent out playing. Children would ride their bikes to a local park and play baseball. They would get out in the yard and play catch. Fifty years ago you rarely saw an obese child because most kids were so active. They came right in from school each day, got a snack, and took off to play with their friends until their parents would call them in at dark. Those days are over! It’s about time that parents and teachers realized that technology is here to stay. We’re never going back to those days of old when children played baseball in the street and rode their bikes to a friend’s house for a game of hide and seek. Technology will continue to advance, offering us more and more opportunities to sit in front of a TV or computer screen and fewer opportunities to get outdoors and get some exercise and fresh air. When we realize that our society has indeed evolved to a place where our kids would rather spend an entire evening watching movies, then maybe it’s time to move in a healthier direction, and with a shift of energy and attention. We can help our kids connect with fun but physical activities, and give them the tools they need for a healthier lifestyle.

In the current political environment, many critics of government action in the world today invoke the term. Leaders in Great Britain during the 1930s were often praised or criticized because of appeasement policies. Much of the population of Great Britain and the rest of Europe, as well as the United States, Canada, and Australia, were strongly in favor of appeasement. The support for appeasement policies was often seen as a reaction to the carnage of World War One. In the early 1930s, appeasing concessions were widely seen as positive, but by 1935, many in Great Britain were worried that Hitler was rearming Germany and rebuilding its military. With the total annexation of Austria, referred to as the Anschluss, in March of 1938, real fear began to shift public opinion in Great Britain. Later in 1938, Great Britain and France agreed to Germany's demand for the Sudetenland, part of the country of Czechoslovakia. A mere six months later in March of 1939, Hitler marched into other parts of Czechoslovakia, the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, and occupied those. Finally, Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. All efforts to appease Hitler ended with France and Great Britain declaring war on Germany.

Setting goals that are too high or unachievable will only serve to demotivate you and cause you to make less progress than you could have made."},{"prompt":"Can you summarize the three methods of capturing carbon dioxide discussed in the article? Use the following article: How can we capture carbon? There are essentially three ways to capture the carbon dioxide from a power plant: before the fuel is burned (precombustion), after the fuel is burned (postcombustion), or by burning the fuel in more oxygen and storing all the gases produced as a result (oxyfuel). Precombustion In precombustion, the aim is to remove the carbon from coal fuel before it's burned. The coal is reacted with oxygen (O2) to make syngas (synthesis gas), a mixture of carbon (CO) monoxide and hydrogen (H2) gases. The hydrogen can be removed and either burned directly as fuel or compressed and stored for use in fuel-cell cars. Water is added to the carbon monoxide to make carbon dioxide (which is stored) and additional hydrogen, which is added to the hydrogen previously removed. Postcombustion In postcombustion, we're trying to remove carbon dioxide from a power station's output after a fuel has been burned. That means waste gases have to be captured and scrubbed clean of their CO2 before they travel up smokestacks. The scrubbing is done by passing the gases through ammonia, which is then blasted clean with steam, releasing the CO2 for storage. Oxyfuel (oxycombustion) CCS would be much easier if power plants produced pure CO2 as their smokestack waste. Then, instead of laboriously separating out the CO2 from other waste gases, we could trap the entire output from the smokestacks and store the lot. The trouble is that power plants don't produce pure CO2 because there's often not enough oxygen for complete combustion they produce other pollutant gases as well. One way to purify the exhaust is to blow extra oxygen into the furnace so the fuel burns completely producing relatively pure steam and CO2. Once the steam is removed (by cooling and condensing it to make water), the CO2 can be stored.","completion":"The article explores precombustion, post-combustion, and oxyfuel as methods for capturing CO2 emissions from power plants. Precombustion entails eliminating carbon before burning fuel, post-combustion entails trapping CO2 emissions after the fuel is burned, and oxyfuel involves using oxygen to burn fuel and produce CO2 for storage purposes."},{"prompt":"Write a blog post for beginners who would like to get into running but don't know what to wear. Talk about different fabrics and running surfaces.","completion":"Running is a fantastic sport to get into as it requires very little equipment to get started! To make your entry into running more comfortable, I would recommend you consider a few items to get you on the right track. There are two main things you need when you're running: running shoes and comfortable clothing. When you're out for a run, you want to be fully immersed in the experience, without your clothes causing distraction or discomfort. Although you can feel free to wear anything you choose when you're running, it is advisable to wear clothes that are designed for the purpose. The two main attributes to look for in running gear are chafe-free and constriction-free. Chafe-free fabric is essential for high-friction areas such as underarms and thighs. You should aim to purchase some lightweight, moisture-wicking clothing to avoid discomfort. Purchasing constriction-free designs applies to both footwear and clothing. Overly tight footwear will become painful very quickly and constrictive clothing can cause chaffing and further distraction in the elements. When deciding on footwear, it is important to assess what surface you will be running on. Is it a trail or a woodland path? Or will you be pounding the pavements of a city? Once you have ascertained your running route, aim to purchase the correct running sneakers that are built for your chosen surface. By considering this, you will be further protected against injury and discomfort."},{"prompt":"I'm bored with how my bathroom looks. How can I update the look of my bathroom without remodeling? Provide 5 suggestions and explain why you chose those. I cannot repaint the walls, so leave that out.","completion":"Do you want to refresh the look of your bathroom? No problem! Here are a few things that you can try, without remodeling or repainting the walls: 1. Replace old towels. This might not seem like much, but if your towels are stained or worn out, then getting new towels will feel great. They can also make your bathroom look cleaner, especially if your towels are stored in a visible area. 2. Replace your shower curtain: If you have a shower curtain, then getting a new one is a quick and easy way to change the appearance of your space. Don't forget to replace the old curtain liner, too! 3. Update bathroom accessories: Sometimes the small touches make all the difference. Get a new shower rod, towel rods, toilet paper dispenser, shower caddies, soap dishes, and toothbrush holders. Choose styles and colors that complement your new towels and shower curtain to tie the look together. 4. Organize your bathroom: Is your bathroom cluttered? Create a cleaner space that looks great and is easier to use with some bathroom organization products. This can include baskets, drawer organizers, and more. 5. Add some decorative touches. Personalize your space with some decorative items that you love. Hang a few pictures on the walls, add a plant or two if the room has enough lighting, or don your bathroom shelves with figurines or artwork."},{"prompt":"Write a memo from a keyboard to the computer user asking them not to bash the keys as much.

He had already published several papers, but this was his first opportunity to present his work to a large audience. Geraldo started his presentation by giving a brief overview of his research. He then went into more detail about his methods and findings. He spoke clearly and passionately, and he could tell that the audience was interested. However, as Geraldo continued his presentation, he started to notice that the crowd was getting restless. People were talking and fidgeting, and some of them were even getting up and leaving. Geraldo tried to ignore the distractions, but they were too much for him. He could feel his anxiety rising, and he was starting to stumble over his words. He lost his train of thought several times. Finally, Geraldo could take it no more. He stopped his presentation and looked out at the crowd. \\"I'm sorry,\\" he said. \\"I can't do this.\\" The crowd then erupted into applause. People were cheering and laughing, and some of them were even giving Geraldo a standing ovation. Some people hooted and whistled. Geraldo was confused. He didn't understand why the crowd was so happy. He felt that his presentation had been a failure. Then, one of the people in the crowd shouted, \\"We're not laughing at you, Geraldo.

From at least A.D. 1000, a group of farming Indians known as the Apalachee lived in northwest Florida. Their territory extended from the Aucilla River to the east and the Ochlockonee River to the west, and from what is now the Georgia state line to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to European contact, there were at least 50,000-60,000 Apalachees. They were a strong and powerful tribe living in widely dispersed villages. Other tribes respected the Apalachees because they belonged to an advanced Indian civilization, they were prosperous, and they were fierce warriors. For food, they grew corn, beans and squash. Men prepared the fields and women tended the crops. Men also hunted bear, deer and small game, while women gathered nuts and berries. Traditionally the men wore deerskin loincloths and women wore Spanish moss skirts. When preparing for battle, the men painted their bodies with red ochre and put feathers in their hair. The Apalachees played a ball game that was a religious exercise as well as a sport. One village would challenge another to a match, and the two teams would have up to 100 players each. They used a hard clay ball about the size of a golf ball covered with buckskin. Players propelled the ball with their feet toward the goal post which was a pole topped with a stuffed eagle in a nest. They played the ball game in the spring and summer, and dedicated it to the gods of rain and thunder to ensure rain for their crops. One feature of Apalachee society was their large ceremonial mounds. The largest prehistoric Apalachee settlement at Lake Jackson north of Tallahassee originally consisted of seven large earthen mounds. Some of the mounds had structures on top, and it is generally believed that the largest mound within a complex was the site of the chief’s house. The Apalachee of northwest Florida were among the first indigenous North Americans encountered by European explorers. In 1539, Hernando de Soto wintered in Apalachee Province. His expedition members stayed in the sixteenth century Apalachee capital village called Anhaica. They received a hostile reception and were under almost constant attack from the Apalachees. The European presence eventually took its toll on the Apalachees from continual skirmishes and, eventually, contagious diseases that were introduced by the explorers. When epidemics and the threat of foreign attacks brought about a loss of faith in the traditional customs and leadership, the Apalachees converted to Catholicism. Anhaica, became one of the first missions established in Apalachee Province by Spanish Franciscan priests around 1633. It eventually relocated to present day Tallahassee and renamed San Luis de Talimali. In 1704 the mission system collapsed under the weight of British attacks. Many of the Apalachee who survived moved northwest to French-held Mobile, an area encompassing what are now southeastern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. Time passed and these descendants of Mission San Luis disappeared from American history books for the next 200 hundred years. However, about 300 Apalachee descendants—today the only known descendants of Florida’s original inhabitants—have survived. They currently live in Louisiana and are seeking state and federal recognition as the Talimali Band of the Apalachee Indians of Louisiana, Inc. Apalachee people remember their collective past while planning for the future, secure in the knowledge of who they are and from whence they came.","completion":"The Apalachee population before European contact was at least 50,000-60,000."},{"prompt":"Create a social media post for Facebook asking people to donate to your animal shelter, \\"Raining Cats & Dogs,\\" from the point of view of a cat named Jimmy.

Choose one example from each and go into detail about the concept or theorem and its impact.","completion":"Sure! I would be happy to go into detail about three famous concepts in statistics, mathematics, and physics! 1. The Invention of Calculus - Isaac Newton invented the concept of calculus in 1665. Although calculus has uses in physics, biology, economics, engineering, chemistry, and more, its most common association is with mathematics. Calculus is about studying the rate of change over time. Differential calculus can be compared to algebra. Calculus is used to define the slope of the curve, while algebra is more focused on straight lines. Integral calculus is used when the area under a graph needs to be calculated. It can break a sloped line into smaller segments to solve a problem that algebra can't. Isaac Newton found that when trying to describe the speed of a falling object, the speed increased every second, although no mathematical solution explained why at the time. He found the explanation through calculus and used the same formula to explain the orbits of the sun, moon, and other planets. There are many uses for calculus today: it is heavily tied into all aspects of engineering, it can be used when data is being collected and analyzed, and, of course, it is still taught in various forms at the high school and, more typically, college level. Its invention also allowed for other scientific theories to come after it, such as the theory of relativity. 2. The Theory of Relativity - Widely known as the most famous theory in all of physics, the theory was invented by Albert Einstein. He had published a paper ten years earlier than his more famous theory about \\"special relativity,\\" which explained space and time, but the theory did not address gravity. Einstein's theory expanded upon Newton's by determining the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers. He also showed the speed of light on its own is the same no matter what speed the observer is traveling. Equations for this theory also prove that massive objects distort spacetime. Light bends around massive objects like black holes, allowing it to act as a lens for things that are behind it; this is used by scientists to observe stars. Another aspect of the theory of relativity that is widely known is its direct impact on allowing the invention of the atomic bomb. Einstein was around during its creation but did not directly work on it himself, instead warning about the potential of its possible impact. 3. Normal Distribution - One of the most common concepts in statistics, also known as the Bell Curve, normal distribution affects many parts of our everyday lives. It explains various distributions such as the heights of the general public, errors in measurement, blood pressure, marks on a test, and intelligence of the populace, just to name a few examples. Related to the normal distribution is the standard deviation; the highest number of examples occur right in the middle of the graph, while standard deviations to the left and right are much less common. Typically two standard deviations away from the mean are rare, while three or more are exceedingly rare. This explains things like why there are so few extremely intelligent people. The probability of distribution means the odds of it happening are very unlikely, all factors considered."},{"prompt":"Can you write me a short python function that returns an x-by-y 2-dimensional numpy array with a checker pattern of either 1 or 0?

The three furry felines — named P-113, 114, and P-115 — are the offspring of P-77, a mountain lion who’s been living on a small patch between the 101 and 118 freeways. This is the third litter the NPS has found in the Simi Hills over the past five years. Jeff Sikich, the lead field biologist of long-term study of mountain lions, says he’s interested to see how the kittens will adapt to the region's urban areas. “It will be interesting to learn how these kittens will use the landscape once they get older and disperse,\\" he said, \\"particularly if they decide to stay in the Simi Hills or cross freeways to enter larger natural areas.” Given the recent deaths of mountain lions in L.A., including the loss of the famous P-22, these recent births shine a light on a more hopeful future for a species that have adapted to a fragmented landscape of Los Angeles.

He first attracted notice in vaudeville in the United States and then as \\"Harry 'Handcuff' Houdini\\" on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjackets under water, and having to escape from and hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it. In 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by London's Daily Mirror, keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists. As President of the Society of American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.

I'm on the fence about it, but my best friend loves frogs and keeps trying to talk me into it. Thank you!","completion":"Frogs are incredible animals, and here are ten reasons why you should get one: 1. Frogs are relatively low-maintenance pets. Each species requires different care, so you should still research them heavily before you bring one into your living space, but they largely stay in their tanks and don't need you to walk or play with them like a dog or cat. 2. You can choose from hundreds of frog and toad species, each with unique traits. They have different songs, patterns, food and environment preferences, and levels of friendliness--yes, a frog can be friendly! Some are easier to care for than others as well. 3. Frogs delight you with their charming love songs. Look them up online, and see which one is your favorite. They have a range of different sounds: some croak, some bark, and some even make vibrating sounds. 4. You don't need a lot of space for a pet frog. If you live in an apartment, your landlord may permit a frog even if they don't let you have other types of pets. Just make sure that their tank is the right size for their species. They need plenty of room to climb and grow. 5. Frogs are affordable. You'll sink some money into your new pet, but they don't need vaccinations, large quantities of expensive food (usually), or other expenses associated with mammals. 6. If you don't have a pet store in your area, you can order frogs and toads online. This broadens your options because even pet stores carry a limited selection of species--if they carry frogs at all. You can even buy tropical varieties, such as red-eye tree frogs and poison dart frogs (captive varieties aren't poisonous.) 7. Frogs are important, but they're not a lifetime commitment. You should still do your research because some species can live for twenty years if you care for them correctly. However, your pet probably won't outlive you as some species might. 8. If you have kids, having a frog is a good way to teach them about responsibility and pet ownership without committing to a large mammal. 9. You can gently handle frogs and toads as long as you wash your hands first and wear rubber gloves. 10. Multiple frogs can live in the same tank if it's large enough--just do your research to make sure that you don't overcrowd them. Additionally, if you end up with male and female pairs, watch out for eggs! Frogs get frisky during mating season. On a final note, make sure you buy frogs from a reputable pet store or breeder. Some kidnap them from other countries, causing many to die in transit, or breed them in unsafe conditions. Support people who treat frogs ethically. They're little lives, but they're just as important as any other creature."},{"prompt":"How big is the Sahara desert?","completion":"Sahara desert, the largest hottest desert in the world, is located in North Africa and covers about 9,200,000 square kilometers, which is comparable to the size of the US or China.

It did not go well...at all. I usually wake up and make a cup of instant coffee. The caffeine perks me up and gets me ready for the rest of the day. But on this particular day, I was in a rush to go to the bank to do some business before I went to work, and I ended up leaving the house without my daily cup. As soon as I got into my car and started driving out of the driveway, I realized my mistake, but I was already on the move, and it was too late for me to turn around and go back for my hot beverage. So I decided to just forget it and continue on with the task at hand. I mean, it won't be a problem without one day of drinking coffee, will it? As soon as I finished that thought, I became distracted by a clown dancing at the corner of the upcoming intersection. The clown was spinning an arrow-shaped sign as it danced, so I couldn't quite make out what the sign said, but there appeared to be some printed writing on it. I stopped at the intersection and attempted to get a better look at the sign...or so I thought. Instead of stopping at the intersection, I pressed my foot onto the wrong pedal and ended up accelerating through the intersection and was broadsided by a car coming from my right. As I brushed the shattered glass from the windshield off me, I looked up and saw that the vehicle that struck me was a blue-and-white police car, now with its blue lights flashing. I had been struck by a police officer trying to get to an emergency down the road, and I was subsequently ticketed for failing to stop at the stop sign. All of this was because I forgot my morning routine of drinking my morning cup of coffee."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this paragraph so it is a bulleted list of things that make Rio worth visiting.

He was drenched in sweat both from the effort of the journey and the humid climate. His clothes were stuck to his skin, but upon opening the cave entrance, he was met with a cool rush of wind. The distant sound of an underground river met his ears as he pressed on deeper into the opening. He scanned the ceiling for anything that might be lurking above. As he explored, the beam of his flashlight uncovered a massive cave. A thick layer of dust hung in the air and drifted across the beam of his light. Massive pillars connected the floor and the ceiling, clearly the work of an architect. All of a sudden, the cave began to tremble, and Barry saw a pair of vertical pupils appear from the darkness. Behind him, a massive snake coiled lazily in front of the door. Before he could process what he was seeing, he was trapped. A massive face appeared before him, golden teeth glimmering in the flashlight's glow. Barry looked behind him. The dragon's tail was half-blocking the entrance, almost as a dare. He had no doubt that the dragon would squash him flat if he tried to escape. \\"Well, another adventurer come to grace me with his presence. How serendipitous.\\" The dragon's voice was eloquent, rich, and conniving. He loved company almost as much as he loved eating trespassers. \\"You've caught me at a bad time, I'm afraid.\\" The dragon cooed in a disappointed voice. \\"I was about to take my nap, but I suppose I can entertain a guest like the good host I am.\\" \\"What do you want, dragon?\\" It was only when Barry spoke that he realized just how much the dragon's voice filled the room. His paled by comparison. \\"Well, I'm going to eat you,\\" the dragon said, baring his teeth as he pronounced the 't' in eat. \\"But if you can ask me two questions I can't answer, I will free you.\\" Barry thought for a moment, then responded. \\"What is a question you can't answer?\\" The dragon looked shocked, realizing the trap he was in. To answer the question would be to allow Barry to ask a question he couldn't answer.

Here is the article I am talking about: No wonder Teddy Roosevelt called the Grand Canyon “the one great sight every American should see.” Walk to its edge, and the earth falls away into an expanse of peaks, plateaus, and gorges so vast it can be disorienting. Descend below the rim, and the sense of awe only grows. The canyon is essentially an inverted, 6,000-foot, 277-mile-long mountain range, where you are dwarfed by sheer stone walls stacked to the sky and vistas that multiply with every turn. In the desert landscape, the water can be the most astonishing sight. Turquoise streams rush whole out of rust-red cliffs and cascade through travertine pools. At the bottom of the canyon lies the engine of this significant geological conundrum—the thrumming, persistent Colorado River, which carved the gorge over millennia. If there’s a better place to gain perspective on our relative insignificance, I don’t know it. But all this comes with a downside. The park gets crowded. More than 4.5 million people visited in 2021 alone. Don’t let that stop you from planning a trip, though. Just a fraction of visitors bothers to descend into the canyon, which means it’s easy to find solitude. But with 595 miles of established trails, 278 miles of river to float, and countless panoramas, historic sites, and overlooks to explore, it’s hard to know where to start. Here’s how to make the most of an adventure to one of our country’s most rugged and iconic places.","completion":"Visitors to the Grand Canyon can find solitude and escape the crowds by descending into the canyon, as only a fraction of visitors do.

Some of the key roles include: 1. Detoxification: The liver filters the blood from the digestive tract, neutralizing harmful chemicals and metabolizing drugs before the blood circulates to the rest of the body. 2. Bile Production: Bile is produced in the liver. It is a fluid that assists in digesting fats and eliminating waste products from the blood. 3. Glucose Storage and Release: The liver plays a key role in regulating blood sugar levels. It stores excess glucose as glycogen and converts it back to glucose when levels in the body are low. 4. Protein Production: The liver creates essential proteins, including albumin, which is crucial for maintaining fluid within the bloodstream and clotting factors that allow blood to clot. 5. Hemoglobin Processing: The liver breaks down old or damaged red blood cells and repurposes the iron within hemoglobin to form new cells. 6. Vitamin and Mineral Storage: The liver stores significant amounts of vitamins A, D, E, K, and B12, as well as iron and copper, releasing them into the bloodstream as needed."},{"prompt":"Who won the NBA title in 2021?","completion":"The Milwaukee Buck defeated the Phoenix Suns in six games to win the 2021 NBA Finals.

But I believe the meaning goes much deeper than that. When Shakespeare speaks of the world being a stage and the men and women as players, he’s tapping into a much bigger idea. His idea was that we, human beings, are all being directed by something much bigger than us, just as a play director manipulates his actors. That everything that we do, say, and experience, is actually already in motion long before we understand what is even happening. That we have no free will of our own but are simply performing a show that was made just for us. Now, while this may be a controversial synopsis, it seems to me that this one line shows clearly that Shakespeare did not believe we are in control of our own lives, but that everything happening is simply one big play, but we don’t know the ending."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],F={key:0},E={key:1};function z(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=y("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(o(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(o(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),a("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
