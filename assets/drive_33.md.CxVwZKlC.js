Q: Article: In New Britain, Connecticut, a new official in charge of schools named Kelt Cooper wants to end high truancy rates among public school students, and he's suggesting financial punishments to get job done. A plan to fine students up to 75 for each day they skip school is now being considered by New Britain authorities. The concept of fining kids for skipping school may come as a shock, but it's not new. In Ohio, the parents responsible for a student guilty of habitual truancy can be fined up to 500 and/or be required to perform up to 70 hours of community service. Until recently, students in Los Angeles could be hit with a 250 punishment for each count of truancy; in early 2012 the law was changed and the heavy fines were removed, though a 20 punishment may still be handed out if a student truants for the third time. Fines for truancy are also in effect overseas. In the UK, The Guardian reports, parents can be fined PS50 (about 80) per skipped school day. The punishment doubles if it's not paid within 28 days. The question is: Do fines like this work? The vast majority of authorities in the UK said that, indeed, they do. The fines were believed either \\"very successful\\" or \\"fairly successful\\" by 79% in reducing truancy, according to a survey. If the plan is passed in Connecticut, it's unclear how effective the law might be, how to make parents and students obey the law and what might happen if they refuse to pay. However, local officials seem to be willing to _ . According to the Hartford Courant: \\"The mayor agrees that truancy is a real issue in New Britain schools, and what's been done in the past hasn't been working to reduce truancy.\\" said Phil Sherwood, assistant to Mayor Timothy O' Brien. And what do the students think? In the New Britain Herald, one 17-year-old entering her senior year called the plan \\"ridiculous\\" and predicted that the punishments will bring about negative effects on the court system. Besides, \\"I don't see the point,\\" she said. \\"Kids will just try harder not to get caught.\\" Question: The passage mainly discusses whether _ . Options: (A) schools have the right to punish students (B) authorities should consider protecting kids (C) students should be fined for skipping school (D) parents are responsible for children's truancy A:","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first best thing to talk about the movie is The idea of remaking the mighty SHOLAY. And Varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie. If he repeated the same Ramghad backdrop, people will again say there is nothing new in this. Different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy. Right from the start of his career with SIVA in Telugu, he had been using the same lighting and kind of background. I seriously dunno this guy Varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis GODFATHER. It's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots!!!!!!! The shot division is lame. Characters couldn't carry an emotion, performances are not to their mark, Storytelling is worse, Background is really really terrible. Babban:- Amitabhz been over prioritized to his job. VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of Hindi Cinema. There's no comparison of Gabbar with Babban. Babban is a more psycho rather than a villain, still he has a soft corner for his brother ( It's a gift in this movie). Amitabhz performance is not to his mark. His appearance itself is pathetic. The scar on his nose, symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema. What ever they worked on Babban is not successful. Babban is no comparison with Gabbar. Narsimha:- The first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands. If varma did that , it would be like teaching ABCD to a Bachelor degree holder. Itz good he opened the secret early. But the flashback is pathetic. Varma couldn't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark. Durga:- The only character with betterment. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story. Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo:- No body bothers or at least considers these character. The utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz. These characters carry nothing to this movie. RAMGOPALVARMA:- His quality is degrading, diminishing. AAG totally can be treated as a C grade movie. Sholay is a fire of revenge, problem of a town, meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by Dharmendra. AAG never carried an emotion with its characters. Storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters. Don't compare AAG with sholay, still u will not like it. If you dare watch this movie. You will be burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?

After facing such trials as confounded doctors and his angry cat, he accidentally gets locked in the basement, where he must battle a spider.===================================================The title and credits are in white font over a black background, which dissolves to a swirling fog. We open on the shore with waves gently rolling on to a beach, then a boat gently bobbing on the ocean. Robert Scott Carey (Grant Williams) narrates a few lines, \\"The strange, almost unbelievable story of Robert Scott Carey, began on a very ordinary summer day. I know this story better than anyone because I am Robert Scott Carey.\\" Carey and his wife of six years, Louise (Randy Stuart) are resting on the bow of his brother's boat. They are on vacation and soaking up some sun. Louise goes below to get Scott a beer. A strange cloud or patch of fog approaches. Scott attempts to make his way below, but the shimmery fog coats his head and body with what appears to be glitter before he can do so.Six months later the milkman makes his morning delivery to the Carey home. Louise gives the cat some of the milk then goes into the house to finish preparing breakfast. Scott asks about his clothes. They are too loose. Pants and shirts are too large. He is losing weight and chides his wife about her cooking as the cause. He asks Louise to pick up a bathroom scale. Increasingly concerned, he visits his family physician, Dr. Arthur Bramson (William Schallert) and is told his height measures five-feet and eleven inches. Scott informs the doctor, \\"I've been six foot, one-inch since I was seventeen.\\" The doctor chalks his weight loss up to overwork and stress. He reassures Scott that, \\"People just don't get shorter.\\" A week later Scott notices even his bathrobe doesn't quite fit right. When Louise suggests a visit to the doctor, Scott informs her he saw a doctor a week ago. They prepare for bed and he kisses his wife and notices he's getting shorter....

Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. Prior to Spanish colonization in the late 15th century, Cuba was inhabited by Amerindian tribes. It remained a colony of Spain until the Spanish–American War of 1898, which led to nominal independence as a \\"de facto\\" United States protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952. Further unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 Movement, which afterwards established a dictatorship under the leadership of Fidel Castro. Since 1965, the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba. A point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.

Options: - detestable - enabled - effusive - weird - accidental The answer is \\"accidental\\" because A:","completion":"The answer is \\"accidental\\" because an oil spill of such magnitude, like the one John was responsible for, can be attributed to various factors that are typically unforeseen and unintentional. Analyzing the given options, we can see that \\"accidental\\" is the most suitable choice to describe this event, and here are the reasons why the other options may not be appropriate: 1. Detestable: While an oil spill can certainly be viewed as a detestable incident due to its harmful environmental impacts, this adjective emphasizes a subjective connotation that does not accurately represent the cause of the event. Instead, it describes the emotional reaction to the spill rather than the nature of the incident itself. 2. Enabled: While it is true that an oil spill may occur due to certain factors that enable it to happen, such as insufficient regulations, negligence, or technical issues, this term does not thoroughly describe the incident. Enabled implies a level of intention or allowance that does not necessarily align with the context of a major accident. 3. Effusive: This term typically refers to a highly expressive or emotional outpouring and is not suitable for describing an oil spill. It may be applicable when discussing the reactions to an event but is ill-suited to addressing the root cause or nature of the event. 4. Weird: The term \\"weird\\" conveys a sense of peculiarity or strangeness, which does not correctly describe the nature of an oil spill. While unusual in occurrence, oil spills are not inherently strange events but rather unfortunate accidents resulting from various contributing factors. In contrast, the term \\"accidental\\" best describes the nature of John's oil spill, as it emphasizes the unintended and unforeseen aspects of the event. By choosing \\"accidental,\\" we acknowledge that the spill was not a deliberate act but rather a regrettable incident stemming from a combination of factors such as human error, equipment failure, or natural disasters. This term reflects the complex nature of oil spill causation while maintaining a neutral tone that avoids subjective assumptions about intentions or emotions surrounding the event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water. and the situation: Bobby and Ned are two neighbors who both have medium sized gardens in their backyards. They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power. Answer the following question: Who has more anaerobic bacteria in their garden's soil? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information and the situation, it is most likely that Ned has more anaerobic bacteria in his garden's soil than Bobby. Here is my step-by-step reasoning for this conclusion: 1. Ned's garden is currently flooded, while Bobby's is not. 2. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic and eventually anoxic. 3. Anaerobic bacteria thrive in anoxic environments (environments with very low or no oxygen available). 4. Ned's garden being flooded creates an anoxic environment, which would promote the growth and activity of anaerobic bacteria. 5. Since Bobby's garden is not flooded, the soil in his garden is likely to have more oxygen available, creating less favorable conditions for anaerobic bacteria. Considering these steps, it can be concluded that Ned's garden would have more anaerobic bacteria in its soil compared to Bobby's garden."},{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... When did Comey write his book?

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] and the situation: Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil.

Seeing their interest, Jennifer offered them a taste of her grilled creations, making some new friends while exchanging cooking techniques. Step 5: Show the characters interacting with others - Jennifer shares her grilled fish with fellow park visitors, which in turn allows her to make new friends and exchange recipes. Meanwhile, Rachel sat back and silently observed her sister's interactions, her ice cream cone slowly melting in her hand. She appreciated Jennifer's sociable nature and thought about how she could make new friends herself. Licking the last remnants of the melted ice cream, she had an idea - to invite her new neighbors over for a dessert-themed ice cream party at their apartment. Step 6: Present a change or growth in one of the characters - Rachel finds inspiration in her sister's actions and decides to be more outgoing and welcoming. The picnic turned out to be more than a delicious and leisurely outdoor meal – it became an opportunity for Rachel and Jennifer to learn from each other and connect with their community. Step 7: End the story on a positive note - The picnic allowed the sisters to learn from each other and brought them closer together, while also connecting them to their community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An absolute disaster. The film got an X rating at its release (it's been lowered to an R), mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in which Welch attempts to have sex with Fawcett.

Firstly, the premise talks about the \\"National Saving (1990-2000) 80 Figure 4.2: Unified Surpluses and Deficits as a Share of GDP Under.\\" This statement indicates that 'Figure 4.2' in context contains graphical or numerical data regarding the description that follows. The description given is 'Unified Surpluses and Deficits as a Share of GDP Under.' Then, consider the hypothesis—\\"Figure 4.2 depicts the unified surpluses and deficits which are represented in terms of GDP share.\\" Here, the hypothesis is offering a summary of the information contained in 'Figure 4.2.' Comparing the hypothesis to the premise, we can observe that both are consistent in stating that 'Figure 4.2' is displaying data concerning 'Unified Surpluses and Deficits,' and that these are represented in terms of GDP share. Moreover, the use of the term 'unified surpluses and deficits' typically refers to a consolidated view of a nation's fiscal position which includes both its surpluses (when its revenues exceed its expenditures) and deficits (when its expenditures exceed its revenues). In economics, when surpluses and deficits are said to be represented 'as a share of GDP,' it signifies that the data is presented as a proportion of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The GDP is a broad measure of a nation's economic activity and, by expressing surpluses and deficits in relation to GDP, it allows for a contextual understanding of the scale of these surpluses and deficits in relation to the overall economic size and performance of the nation in question. Therefore, to summarize, the premise indeed supports the hypothesis; 'Figure 4.2' does portray the 'unified surpluses and deficits' which are expressed 'as a share of GDP.' Quoting data in relation to GDP share can provide a meaningful context that enables an understanding of public finance dynamics in relation to the broader economic landscape. This is helpful in understanding adjusted views on the scale and implications of national surpluses and deficits. So, the premise and hypothesis do correlate in symbiosis to proffer this insight."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we have to simplify the equation a bit. Here's what we have: -67 * b = -513 * b + 468 + 1680 + 3204 Now, let's add the numbers on the right side together: 468 + 1680 + 3204 = 5352 So our equation becomes: -67 * b = -513 * b + 5352 Now we want to get all the b's on one side and the numbers on the other side. To do this, let's add 513 * b to both sides: (-67 * b) + (513 * b) = -513 * b + 5352 + 513 * b As we add, the -513 * b and +513 * b cancel out on the right side, and we get: 446 * b = 5352 To find the value of b, we need to get it by itself. So, let's divide both sides by 446: (446 * b) / 446 = 5352 / 446 After dividing, we get the answer: b = 12 So the answer is, b equals 12. Good job!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The dish 'Rijsttafel' (Pron. rice-taffel), that takes its name from the Dutch for 'rice-table', originated in which country? Answer:","completion":"The dish 'Rijsttafel' (pronounced rice-taffel), which translates to 'rice table' in Dutch, originated in Indonesia during the colonial period when the region was known as the Dutch East Indies. The roots of this dish can be traced back to the unique Indonesian culinary tradition where a vast array of dishes are served alongside rice, their staple food. 'Dutch Rijsttafel' was created by the Dutch colonialists who wanted to bring together the diverse and rich flavors of the Indonesian archipelago in a single dining experience. The Dutch were drawn to the appealing tastes and aromas of Indonesian food, and they developed the concept of Rijsttafel as a way to sample an assortment of dishes in one meal. The Dutch transformed the traditional Indonesian dining habit into a more formal, elaborate, and sophisticated affair. Rijsttafel is a feast that typically features an abundance of dishes. It is an elaborate meal consisting of numerous side dishes, ranging from meats, poultry, fish, vegetables, and condiments, accompanied by rice, usually steamed. Some of the traditional Indonesian dishes included in a Rijsttafel are: 1. Satay: Grilled, skewered meat, typically served with peanut sauce 2. Gado-Gado: A salad made from boiled vegetables served with peanut sauce 3. Rendang: A slow-cooked, spicy meat dish typically made with beef 4. Nasi Goreng: Indonesian-style fried rice 5. Babi Kecap: Pork cooked with sweet soy sauce 6. Sambal Udang: Spicy prawn dish 7. Sayur Lodeh: A vegetable curry with coconut milk 8. Tempeh: Fermented soybean cake, often served as a side dish or in stir-fries 9. Ayam Goreng: Indonesian-style fried chicken 10. Atjar: Pickled vegetables These dishes, along with various others, are served simultaneously to create a vibrant and colorful dining experience. The Rijsttafel typically uses a combination of flavors, such as sweet, sour, spicy, and salty, with each dish contributing to the overall taste and balance of the meal. Although Rijsttafel is historically linked to Indonesia, it has become an integral part of Dutch cuisine as the Netherlands has embraced Indonesian food culture. Even after the independence of Indonesia in 1945, the popularity of Rijsttafel remained in the Netherlands, where it can still be found on the menus of various Indonesian and Dutch-Indonesian restaurants. It is often considered a symbol of Dutch colonial history and a way for the Dutch to reminisce about their time in the former Dutch East Indies. In summary, Rijsttafel is a culinary reflection of Dutch colonialism in Indonesia. This elaborate and flavorful meal originates from the desire of the Dutch colonialists to celebrate and enjoy the diverse tastes of the Indonesian archipelago. Today, it is a popular dish both in Indonesia and the Netherlands, serving as a reminder of the historical and cultural connections between the two countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the song to which, working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give it \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505? , can you please find it? In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder.

And the answer is?","completion":"Aloysius Lilius' globally significant chronological creation of 1582 was the Gregorian calendar, which is the calendar system we primarily use today. Aloysius Lilius, also known as Luigi Lilio or Luigi Giglio, was an Italian doctor, astronomer, and philosopher, and he played a crucial role in developing the proposal that led to the creation of the Gregorian calendar. In the 16th century, the Julian calendar, which was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE, was becoming increasingly inaccurate due to its miscalculations of the Earth's annual revolution around the Sun. As a result, important ecclesiastical dates, such as the date of Easter, were becoming misaligned with astronomical events like the spring equinox. To address this, Pope Gregory XIII appointed a commission of scholars, including Aloysius Lilius, to reform the calendar system. Lilius proposed several key changes to rectify the inaccuracies of the Julian calendar. Firstly, he suggested that the calendar should be adjusted by 10 days, reconciling the accumulated omission of leap years and putting the spring equinox back around March 21. Secondly, Lilius introduced a new method for calculating leap years to improve the calendar's long-term accuracy. In the Julian calendar, every fourth year was a leap year. Lilius proposed that years divisible by 100 would only be considered a leap year if they were also divisible by 400. This eliminated three out of every four centennial leap years, making the new calendar system more accurate in terms of solar alignment. On February 24, 1582, Pope Gregory XIII issued the papal bull \\"Inter gravissimas,\\" formally announcing the adoption of the new calendar system. The new calendar was initially adopted by Catholic countries, starting with Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy, and then gradually spread to other parts of Europe and the world. Today, the Gregorian calendar is the most widely used civil calendar system across the globe, serving as the international standard for organizing dates, appointments, and important events. Aloysius Lilius' groundbreaking chronological creation of 1582 has had a lasting and profound impact on the way the world measures time and organizes its affairs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Andy Burnham, the former Health Secretary, was even being touted by some MPs as an emergency replacement for Mr Miliband to avoid ‘catastrophe’ at the next election. The latest poll, carried out by former Conservative treasurer Lord Ashcroft, deepened Labour turmoil by giving David Cameron’s party a two point lead. Last week the two parties were level pegging, but yesterday’s survey found the Tories on 32 per cent and Labour on 30 per cent. The Liberal Democrats were down at just 7 per cent.

Input: On December 20 2018, the Facebook page “Teanderthal Party” posted the following meme about healthcare, “illegal immigration,” terror attacks, and the mortality rate in the United States:It stated:FACT:More Americans die every year from lack of affordable healthcare than from terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined.Teanderthal Party didn’t share any commentary alongside the meme, nor was it accompanied by any citations, sources, or even references backing the point the page was attempting to convey by sharing the meme. Presumably, its creators singled out “illegal immigration” and “terrorist attacks” as common political fears in the United States, and it aimed to suggest that those concerned about those dangers were possibly likelier to die from lack of access to healthcare services. (But without additional context, that remains a guess as good as any. )Regardless of the page’s editorial intent in sharing the meme, its claims remained fact-checkable — to a degree. However, questions remain: If fact-based resources were consulted to compose the meme, did its creator simply reference 2018 (the year in which it was posted to the page)? Was it created and based upon an earlier year? And how far back should we go to examine the claim’s truthfulness?Further, did the meme intend to reference terrorism-related deaths of Americans within the United States, or did it include Americans killed while visiting other countries? Were combat deaths involving the Islamic State (for example) included in the creation of the meme? And with respect to the number of “Americans [who die] … from illegal immigration,” did it mean people murdered by undocumented immigrants, or something else? With such nebulous benchmarks, answering these questions was a dicey prospect.Finally, the precise meaning of dying “from lack of affordable healthcare” was undefined. Would such a number encompass people who succumbed to illness or injury because they were unable to pay for treatment, people whose health declined because they did not maintain any form of medical insurance, or some other category? Would any other scenario be included in the calculation of deaths due to a lack of affordable healthcare?Although vague, the meme pinpointed three metrics of debatable description with which we will try to approximate a truth rating:The first number might be the easiest of the bunch, due to related research appearing from time to time in the news. Fact checkers PolitiFact and FactCheck.org have both tackled variations of the claim, the latter with no rating, while the former assigned a “” decision to a claim no one died from a lack of access to healthcare.Figures from the American Journal of Public Health [PDF] published in 2009 often serve as a benchmark number for deaths linked specifically to a lack of health insurance in American adults. In their study, “Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults,” researchers provided several numbers in different years prior to 2009, estimating that 46 million Americans were uninsured. For the year 2000, researchers estimated 27,424 deaths due to a lack of health insurance among adults in the United States. For 2005, using the same methodology, they calculated between 35,327 deaths in non-elderly people and 44,789 deaths overall.The study was conducted at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Health Alliance, and was based on data obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a September 2009 Harvard Gazette article about the findings, researchers said that the larger 44,789 figure was conservative at the time of its publication:Steffie Woolhandler, study co-author, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a primary care physician at Cambridge Health Alliance, noted: “Historically, every other developed nation has achieved universal health care through some form of nonprofit national health insurance. Our failure to do so means that all Americans pay higher health care costs, and 45,000 pay with their lives.”“The Institute of Medicine, using older studies, estimated that one American dies every 30 minutes from lack of health insurance,” remarked David Himmelstein, study co-author, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a primary care physician at Cambridge Health Alliance.“Even this grim figure is an underestimate — now one dies every 12 minutes.”A major change to policy in the United States took place between the publication of those figures in 2009 and the meme’s circulation in December 2018 — the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known colloquially as “Obamacare”) in March 2010. At the time the paper quoted above was published, 46 million American citizens lacked health insurance.We were unable to locate a one-to-one comparison of estimated deaths from lack of health insurance after passage of the Affordable Care Act, but research published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in September 2017 indicated that 28 million Americans were uninsured at that point. Using the American Journal of Public Health figures of 46 million uninsured Americans and 44,789 deaths for 2005 (published in 2009), we calculated a .097 percent mortality rate. Applying that ratio to the 28 million uninsured Americans referenced in September 2017, 27,160 uninsured Americans could be expected to die of the same general cause.Although figures on deaths due to a lack of health insurance in several given years were relatively easy to find, the other two metrics proved far harder to decisively pin down. Nevertheless, it seemed possible to arrive at a simple “true or false” based on disparity alone.The question of how many Americans are killed annually by undocumented immigrants has come to the forefront of the public discourse, most notably when President Donald Trump referenced a completely unsubstantiated figure of 63,000 American deaths at the hands of undocumented immigrants since September 11, 2001.The Washington Post located the origin of the 63,000 murders figure in June 2018:We traced that number back to its source. On May 5, 2006, [Rep. Steve] King posted an article on his official website in response to national pro-immigration protests held that month. The post is a catalogue of anti-immigrant scaremongering … he explained the math behind his numbers.“The crimes that are committed by those who enter this country illegally are in significantly greater numbers than the crimes that are committed by American citizens,” King said, “to the extent that 28 percent of the inmates in our prisons in the United States are criminal aliens, 28 percent.”That figure he got from a Government Accountability Office report issued in April 2005 …King figured (admitting that [his referenced] number would go up or down a percentage point or two):“That means then that criminal aliens are committing 28 percent of the crimes in the United States. And so that means 28 percent of the murders, 28 percent of the rapes, 28 percent of the violence and the assaults and battery, first- and second-degree murder and also manslaughter attacks are committed by criminal aliens.”In other words, since 28 percent of the prisoners were immigrants in the country illegally, they must also therefore have committed 28 percent of each and every crime! Quod erat demonstratum. Recognizing that this sounded like a lot even at the time, King rationalized it by asserting that for every undocumented immigrant in the country we know about, two or three sneak in without our knowing it. Here’s how we know that’s not true.There is an almost impossibly large number of problems with King’s argument.The first is that, of course, crime is not evenly distributed among populations. If 10 percent of prisoners are named John, that doesn’t mean that people named John commit 10 percent of murders. Many of those undocumented immigrants in federal custody were probably there for a very specific type of crime: felony immigration violations. Very, very few native-born Americans were there for that. In fact, in 2014, half of criminal arrests were for immigration violations. Since the GAO data are only for federal prisoners, that’s significant. (It’s also worth noting, as a reader did, that federal prisoners make up only a small percentage of the entire prison population. )The Post concluded that “King seems to have basically made the number up more than a decade ago,” adding that the Congressman did not even stick with the same figure himself in later reference to the subject:In 2011, King presented a resolution that offered a different calculus.“According to the Government Accountability Office,” it read, “there have been 25,064 homicide arrests of criminal aliens since 1955.”That’s about 1.2 per day.We were unable to locate any trustworthy estimate for the number of Americans killed (intentionally or not) by undocumented immigrants in any given year. And even if that number had been correct instead of specious, 63,000 deaths divided by 17 years equals 3,706 deaths annually — a figure dwarfed by the lowest number of deaths from lack of health insurance by any metric in any year.There is no basis whatsoever to assume the “63,000 since 2001” figure was based in anything at all, but if we apply King’s second formula (1.2 per day) to an annual basis, we get 438 deaths a year, which we can round up to 500 for comparison purposes.Finally, we come to the number of Americans killed annually in terrorist attacks. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) provided figures [PDF] for the number of Americans killed both on and off American soil in terrorist attacks between 1995 and 2016. In that 21-year period, START calculated 3,393 deaths in total in the United States, 3,277 American fatalities on US soil, and 3,658 total American fatalities due to terrorism abroad.Those figures included all deaths during the attacks of September 11, 2001, which totaled 2,902. Averaging the largest number of the three (3,658) per year without adjusting for the outlying events of a single large-scale attack provided a figure of 174 deaths. Subtracting 9/11 from the larger figure and again calculating the number provided an annual average of 36 Americans killed by terrorists each year.In summation, the lowest number of estimated deaths among Americans due to a lack of health insurance in any given year (regardless of the Affordable Care Act’s passage in 2010) totaled more than 27,000. We found no solid figures for the number of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants in any given year, but even the incorrect number of 3,706 annual deaths based on the baseless 63,000 deaths-since-9/11 figure did not approach the number of deaths from lack of access to affordable healthcare. And combining that inaccurately large number with the unadjusted number of terrorism-related deaths (174 deaths per year), the highest comparative total was 4,881 deaths due to undocumented immigrants and terrorism. But once again, the latter two numbers were far likelier under 700 deaths total combined, versus 27,000 deaths on the first count.The meme’s statement that more people die every year from a lack of affordable healthcare than terrorist attacks or “illegal immigration” is true any way you slice it. The latter two numbers in any permutation (even when wildly inflated) come nowhere near matching the very credible figures informing the healthcare deaths estimate, and that remains true regardless of the meme’s extremely poor explanation of its own claims. Output:","completion":"Claim: More Americans die every year from lack of affordable healthcare than from terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An unnamed gunslinger referred to as The Lady enters the Old West town of Redemption circa 1881, where she enters a single elimination gunfighting contest held by Redemption's ruthless mayor and former outlaw John Herod. While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

Since linen closets are closed spaces, they provide protection against dust, dirt, and germs. Keeping towels in a linen closet ensures they are clean and fresh when needed for use. 3. Proper storage conditions: Linen closets usually maintain optimal conditions for storing fabric items. They tend to be cool, dark, and dry spaces that prevent the growth of mildew and mold, thereby preserving the quality and longevity of linens, including bathroom towels. 4. Dedicated space: A significant aspect of human common sense is the inclination to assign specific spaces for particular items or purposes within a household. In this case, the linen closet is designated for holding various linens, making it a logical storage solution for bathroom towels. 5. Consistency: As a generally accepted standard in many households, linen closets are the go-to storage location for towels, bed sheets, and other fabric items.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'.

Article: What do you think of black cats? Are they unluckier than cats of other colors? Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that. Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. \\"You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,\\" Cathy Marden, a scientist said.

Given the question: Given the following context: Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress. and a hint : Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round. Which body of water held more dissolved oxygen? Hint: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released. The answer is:","completion":"To find out which body of water held more dissolved oxygen, let's analyze the information given: 1. Twin I has very cold water all year. 2. Twin II has very warm water all year. 3. The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold (following Henry's Law). 4. As water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. Considering these points, we can infer the following: - Twin I has cold water, meaning it can hold more dissolved oxygen due to the lower temperature. - Twin II has warm water, meaning it can hold less dissolved oxygen due to the higher temperature.

Her parents were Milton, a farmer turned greenkeeper, and Wendy, who worked in a pharmacy. Her creativity was nurtured from a young age. Aged just eight, Oliver attended weekend art classes in Inverell run by Ian Howard, who went on to become dean of the college in Sydney where she would later study. As she was dux of her school, her parents expected her to go on to university. However, Oliver wished to pursue a creative career. When she told her parents of her plans, her mother replied, \\"Darling, your father and I are very pleased you're going to art school, but if you'd been a son, I think we'd be a little disappointed.\\" A rift subsequently developed between her and her family that resulted in her having no contact with them for 25 years.After leaving school, Oliver studied and worked in Sydney.

Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions. - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion. - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars. - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - John the Apostle ( Aramaic : Yohanan Shliha ; Hebrew : Yohanan Ben Zavdai ; Koine Greek : ; Latin : Ioannes ; c. AD 6 -- c. 106 ) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome . His brother was James , who was another of the Twelve Apostles . Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one not to die a martyr 's death ( excluding Judas Iscariot who died by suicide ) . The Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist , John of Patmos , and the Beloved Disciple , although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these mean . The tradition of some Christian denominations holds that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament . - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism.

Context: The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who wanted to complete the memorial offering to select 35 names from Watt's list of names? , can you please find it? Although Watts's plans for the memorial had envisaged names inscribed on the wall, in the event the memorial was designed to hold panels of hand-painted and glazed ceramic tiles. Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied. The subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87. He was hailed \\"The last great Victorian\\", and a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral, 300 yards (270 m) south of Postman's Park, on 7 July 1904.On 11 July 1904 Mary Watts wrote to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial...

Background: Kenule Beeson \\"Ken\\" Saro-Wiwa (10 October 1941 - 10 November 1995) was a Nigerian writer, television producer, environmental activist, and winner of the Right Livelihood Award and the Goldman Environmental Prize. Saro-Wiwa was a member of the Ogoni people, an ethnic minority in Nigeria whose homeland, Ogoniland, in the Niger Delta has been targeted for crude oil extraction since the 1950s and which has suffered extreme environmental damage from decades of indiscriminate petroleum waste dumping. Initially as spokesperson, and then as president, of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Saro-Wiwa led a nonviolent campaign against environmental degradation of the land and waters of Ogoniland by the operations of the multinational petroleum industry, especially the Royal Dutch Shell company. He was also an outspoken critic of the Nigerian government, which he viewed as reluctant to enforce environmental regulations on the foreign petroleum companies operating in the area. Context: Saro-Wiwa was arrested again and detained by Nigerian authorities in June 1993 but was released after a month. On 21 May 1994 four Ogoni chiefs (all on the conservative side of a schism within MOSOP over strategy) were brutally murdered. Saro-Wiwa had been denied entry to Ogoniland on the day of the murders, but he was arrested and accused of incitement to them. He denied the charges but was imprisoned for over a year before being found guilty and sentenced to death by a specially convened tribunal. The same happened to eight other MOSOP leaders who, along with Saro-Wiwa, became known as the Ogoni Nine. Some of the defendants' lawyers resigned in protest against the alleged rigging of the trial by the Abacha regime. The resignations left the defendants to their own means against the tribunal, which continued to bring witnesses to testify against Saro-Wiwa and his peers. Many of these supposed witnesses later admitted that they had been bribed by the Nigerian government to support the criminal allegations. At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony, in the presence of Shell's lawyer. The trial was widely criticised by human rights organisations and, half a year later, Ken Saro-Wiwa received the Right Livelihood Award for his courage, as well as the Goldman Environmental Prize. On 10 November 1995, Saro-Wiwa and the rest of the Ogoni Nine were killed by hanging by military personnel. They were buried in Port Harcourt Cemetery. In his 1989 short story \\"Africa Kills Her Sun\\", Saro-Wiwa in a resigned, melancholic mood, foreshadowed his own execution. Question: Was he placed in jail?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Ken Saro-Wiwa was placed in jail. He was arrested and accused of incitement to murder after four Ogoni chiefs were killed.

Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m²) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally \\"North Way\\", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the North Shore Railroad to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the Susquehanna River, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m).The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m²), but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person whose bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain, and their respective colonies? Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean.

Two women are less likely to co-operate than two men, a study claims. Meryl Streep played mean boss Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada (pictured) They may lack the competitive streak of their male colleagues but women are loath to work together. A study found two women are less likely to co-operate than two men when one is more powerful than the other. Similarly, two females of different rank are less likely to work together than a man and a woman. The finding contradicts the widely held belief that women’s nurturing nature makes it natural for them to help each other out, while men are too competitive to have time for each other. Researchers said that men may be wired to put their differences aside in order to form alliances. Women, however, are most comfortable with people who are on the same level as them. Richard Wrangham, of the University of Quebec at Montreal, said: ‘The question we wanted to examine was: Do men or women co-operate better with members of their own sex? ‘The conventional wisdom is that women co-operate more easily but when you look at how armies or sports teams function, there is evidence that men are better at co-operating in some ways.’ To look at whether there sexes differ in how they co-operate, the scientists looked at research collaborations in 50 university psychology departments. This showed that all female pairings of junior and senior researchers were much less common than collaborations between two men at different stages in their career. However, women of the same rank didn’t seem to have difficulty in working together and mixed-sex collaborations were also common. In other words, the problem arises in situations in which one female is more powerful than the other. Writing in the journal Current Biology, the researchers said the lack of trust may come from both directions. U.S. researchers said that men may be wired to put their differences aside in order to form alliances. Women, however, are most comfortable with people who are on the same level as them. Consequently they believe many women prefer to work with a male boss (pictured) Working for a difficult boss can come with stress, long hours and a poor office atmosphere. Recent research has found it can also be bad for your health. The stress of working for a bad boss over a long period of time can cause serious harm to employees, the study found. Scientists at Ohio State University found that chronic stress causes changes in the gene activity in immune cells. These changes cause the cells to be primed to fight an infection that doesn't exist. This leads to inflammation in the body which is associated with many health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. They said: ‘The study does not demonstrate whether the reduced level of co-operation among women if different status is due to higher-ranked or lower-ranked women. ‘However, our findings are consistent with results from early childhood onwards suggesting that females of lower status can be uncomfortable co-operating with their superiors. ‘Female superiors may also be less willing than male superiors to invest in lower-ranked same-sex individuals.’ Others say that while men make their feelings clear, women are more likely to let jealousies and resentments fester. Harvard University researcher Joyce Benenson, one of the study’s authors, said that women’s instinctive distrust of females in power may make it more difficult for them to scale the career ladder. She said: ‘Females are less likely than males to co-operate across ranks with same-sex individuals. ‘This means that a highly talented newcomer female in any organisation does not receive the support that her male counterpart does from higher-ranked individuals who can help them climb the hierarchy.’ Even having a male boss may not be a huge help. Professor Benenson said: ‘Because men often discriminate against women, it is unclear whether higher-ranked males could be more helpful.’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article presents the findings of a study that claims two women are less likely to cooperate than two men, especially when one is more powerful than the other.

These systems can also help hosts ensure that guests have a consistent wine tasting experience throughout the party. 2. Restaurants: Wine by the glass is a popular choice in many restaurants, allowing patrons to try different wines throughout their meal. By using a wine dispenser or preservation system, restaurants can preserve open bottles of wine, ensuring that each glass will taste as fresh as the first pour. Additionally, these systems can help prevent over-pouring, which can lead to waste and lost revenue. 3. Everyday household consumption: For those who enjoy a glass of wine with their dinner or while relaxing at home, a wine dispenser or preservation system can help maintain the wine's quality. By preserving the wine in an airtight environment, these systems can prevent oxidation and extend the life of a bottle, allowing users to enjoy their wine for an extended period. Overall, wine dispensers and preservation systems offer convenience, quality, and efficiency in various settings.

A less offensive Czech equivalent could be \\"sprostáci\\" (meaning \\"rude people\\") or \\"hlupáci\\" (meaning \\"fools\\"), but to maintain the same level of vulgarity, I would use \\"hajzlové\\" (meaning \\"scumbags\\" or \\"bastards\\"). - \\"are\\": The verb \\"to be,\\" in its present third person plural form, translates to \\"jsou\\" in Czech. - \\"vicious\\": This adjective means \\"aggressive\\" or \\"cruel,\\" and translates to \\"zákeřní\\" in Czech.

Given the question: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath. Pam and Angela live in different cities and are talking to each other on the phone while they are sitting outside. Pam lives in Dunder, a city located at sea level, and Angela lives in Mifflin, a city up high in the mountains. Although they don't get to see each other much any more due to the distance between them, they make sure to stay in regular contact. Which woman gets more oxygen per single breath? The answer is:","completion":"Angela, who lives in Mifflin, a city up high in the mountains, experiences less oxygen per single breath due to the decreased air density and air pressure at higher altitudes. Pam, living in Dunder at sea level, gets more oxygen per single breath as air density and pressure are higher."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the next sentence. How to prevent a house fire Inspect your home. You may need to recruit, or even hire, someone experienced in home electrical wiring, plumbing (gas), heating, and air conditioning to ensure that it is thoroughly inspected. You can also do the checks outlined in the following steps.","completion":"Conduct a thorough assessment of your electrical system. Start by examining the electrical panel, ensuring it is up to date and equipped with appropriately rated circuit breakers or fuses to handle your home's electrical needs. Old and outdated electrical panels can pose a significant fire risk. Look for signs of scorch marks, loose connections, or flickering lights, which may hint at underlying electrical problems that require immediate attention. Replace old, frayed, or damaged electrical cords. Regularly check the appliances, extension cords, and power strips in your home for any signs of wear and tear. If any cords are frayed, exposed, or damaged, replace them immediately to reduce the chances of an electrical fire. Additionally, avoid overloading outlets and power strips, as this can create excessive heat and cause a fire. Install smoke alarms and test them frequently. Ensure that there are functioning smoke alarms installed on every level of your home, especially near bedrooms, hallways, and common areas. Test these alarms monthly to confirm that they are working correctly, and replace their batteries at least once a year. Consider getting interconnected smoke alarms so that if one goes off, all of the alarms in your home will sound, providing faster alerts and increasing the chances of early detection. Clean and maintain your chimney and fireplace. If your home has a wood or gas-burning fireplace, ensure that it is cleaned and inspected regularly by a professional chimney sweep. A buildup of creosote, a highly flammable substance, can cause a chimney fire, which can quickly spread to the rest of your home. Additionally, always use a fireplace screen to prevent embers and sparks from escaping into your living space. Maintain your kitchen appliances and follow cooking safety practices. The majority of house fires start in the kitchen, so it is crucial to keep cooking spaces clean and free from grease buildup. Regularly clean your oven, stovetop, and exhaust hood. When cooking, avoid leaving the kitchen unattended and ensure that you turn off all appliances when they are not in use. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergencies, and never use water to put out a grease fire. Inspect heating equipment and maintain proper clearance from combustibles. Regularly inspect your heating equipment, such as furnaces and space heaters, for any signs of damage or malfunction. Schedule annual inspections and cleanings for your central heating system, and have any necessary repairs completed promptly. Additionally, keep a safe distance between heating equipment and flammable materials to reduce the likelihood of a fire. Store flammable chemicals and materials safely. Store gasoline, paint, solvents, and other flammable chemicals in approved, well-ventilated containers, and keep them away from heat sources, appliances, or open flames. Never store propane tanks indoors, and dispose of oily or greasy rags properly to prevent spontaneous combustion. Develop an emergency escape plan. Discuss a home fire escape plan with your family members and practice it regularly. Ensure that everyone knows at least two ways to exit each room, and designate a safe meeting place outside your home. Install safety ladders on upper-level windows if necessary and teach children how to use them. By taking these important steps to prevent house fires, you can help protect your home, belongings, and most importantly, the lives of your loved ones. Regular maintenance, proactive safety measures, and diligent monitoring of potential hazards can go a long way in significantly reducing the chances of a devastating house fire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He called & said “monster ratings.” Be a man Jimmy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2018 Trump was referring to a Hollywood Reporter interview on Saturday in which Fallon said that he faced negative backlash for the 2016 interview. ADVERTISEMENT \\"It was definitely a down time,” Fallon told the publication. “And it’s tough for morale. There’s 300 people that work here, and so when people are talking that bad about you and ganging up on you, in a really gang-mentality.\\" Fallon said he did not do it to normalize Trump, who was the Republican nominee at the time. “You go, ‘Alright, we get it. I heard you. You made me feel bad. So now what? Are you happy? I’m depressed. Do you want to push me more? What do you want me to do? You want me to kill myself? What would make you happy? Get over it,' \\" Fallon said. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to make anyone angry — I never do and I never will. It’s all in the fun of the show. I made a mistake. I’m sorry if I made anyone mad. And, looking back, I would do it differently,\\" he said. ||||| \\"I did not do it to 'normalize' him or to say I believe in his political beliefs or any of that stuff,\\" says Jimmy Fallon at the point, during our recording of an episode of The Hollywood Reporter's 'Awards Chatter' podcast, when our conversation inevitably arrives at the Sept. 15, 2016, episode of The Tonight Show. That evening, with late night's most iconic program sitting atop the 11:30 p.m. ratings, Fallon welcomed as his guest Donald Trump, whom Fallon had previously interviewed seven times on his first NBC late-night show, Late Night, during the Apprentice era, and then taped a sketch with a year before on The Tonight Show, when Trump was a long-shot candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Now, though, Trump was the nominee — albeit one given no real chance of defeating Hillary Clinton — and Fallon, as jovial an on-screen presence as anyone who has ever held a late-night job, tossed him some softball questions and then asked for — and was granted — permission to \\"mess up\\" Trump's hair, which long had been the subject of speculation and derision. It was, it turned out, the biggest mistake of Fallon's career. He almost immediately began taking incoming fire on social media from people who felt that Trump was an existential threat to America whom Fallon had 'normalized' for people who were still on the fence about him. \\"It just got bigger and out of control,\\" Fallon recalls, speaking in his office at 30 Rock. Then came the shots from Fallon's colleagues. \\"I saw other comedians from other shows making fun of me on Twitter and I go, 'Okay, now I'm just gonna get off,'\\" he says. \\"They know the show. I'm just doing five hours a week. I get in at 10 in the morning, I work 'til seven at night and I'm just trying to make a funny show. [Addressing them:] 'You know the grind and you know me. Of all the people in the world, I'm one of the good people — I mean, really. You don't even know what you're talking about if you say that I'm evil or whatever.' But people just jump on the train, and some people don't even want to hear anything else. They're like, 'No, you did that!'

The younger of two children of an IBM employee and a homemaker, he was, as one might assume, a cutup at home and a class clown at school, and developed a fascination with the mechanics of comedy from an early age. He begged his parents to let him stay up late enough to hear the monologue on Johnny Carson's version of The Tonight Show, and he convinced them to provide him with videotapes of Saturday Night Live episodes (which they censored to make them kid-friendly). For a time, it looked like Fallon, an altar boy who attended Catholic schools, might be headed towards the priesthood — \\"I was really into it, I loved it,\\" he says of life in the church — but in 1992, shortly after graduating high school, he entered, at the encouragement of his mother, a talent contest seeking the funniest person in the Hudson Valley. He performed a bunch of his celebrity impersonations and prevailed, taking home 700, which convinced him to continue to hone his material even as he headed off to Albany's College of Saint Rose. A semester before he was to graduate, Fallon's friend got a tape of his work into the hands of a Brillstein-Grey Entertainment manager, who offered to represent him and urged him to relocate to Los Angeles. His parents blessed the move — after first making him take and pass the test to become a mailman so he would have a fallback career if his dreams out west didn't pan out. It wasn't immediately clear that they would. For a while, Fallon was sleeping on friends' couches, subsisting on ramen noodles and barely making ends meet through occasional sets at The Improv, while also taking classes at The Groundlings. He eventually was hired to act in an indie movie and a TV pilot, but insisted on a contractual clause that would set him free were he ever to get an opportunity to realize his greatest dream, namely, working at SNL. Sure enough, his manager was able to secure him an audition in front of Lorne Michaels when Michaels was out in L.A., but Fallon tanked — \\"It couldn't have been worse,\\" he emphasizes — and Tracy Morgan got the job instead. A year later, though, ahead of the show's 24th season, Fallon was offered another shot, this time at the show's fabled Studio 8H at 30 Rock, and he arrived better prepared — and even managed to crack up the famously stone-faced Michaels. He was invited to join the show's cast and, for six seasons — the latter three of which he spent co-anchoring \\"Weekend Update\\" with Tina Fey — was one of its most prolific and popular members. When he eventually left the show to try to pursue a film career, Michaels planted an idea in his head: that Fallon might one day return to 30 Rock six years hence, when Late Night host Conan O'Brien was slated to replace Jay Leno as the host of The Tonight Show, to become the new host of Late Night. Six years later, Fallon — whose movie star aspirations had been dashed by the critical and commercial failures of 2004's Taxi and 2005's Fever Pitch — was again approached by Michaels about that possibility. After consulting with his wife Nancy Juvonen, a producer whom he met on Fever Pitch and married in 2007, he decided he could not turn down the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of not only O'Brien, but also David Letterman before him. NBC executives initially pushed back against Michaels' idea, but they wanted Michaels to serve as the show's executive producer, and Michaels refused to do so unless Fallon was made the host. \\"That's a big person going to bat for you,\\" Fallon marvels. \\"I really never forgot that.\\" During the four years that Fallon anchored Late Night, spanning 2009-2013, he crafted the same sort of show that he continues to put on to this day: a light one centered around goofy and endearing jokes, sketches, mimicry and games. He also helped to usher in the era of the viral video with segments like \\"The History of Rap,\\" with Justin Timberlake, starting in 2010; \\"Slow Jam the News,\\" which President Barack Obama joined him for in 2012; and \\"The Evolution of Mom Dancing,\\" for which he partnered with Michelle Obama in 2013. When Fallon replaced O'Brien at Late Night, O'Brien replaced Leno at The Tonight Show — but, following a scheduling dispute, O'Brien vacated that job and Leno returned to it. By 2014, though, Leno was ready to leave once and for all, and Fallon was asked to succeed him and become the sixth permanent host of The Tonight Show, after Steve Allen (1954–57), Jack Paar (1957–62), Carson (1962–92), Leno (1992–2009, 2010–14) and O'Brien (2009–10). He accepted, on the conditions that he could remain in New York, where the program had emanated from until 1972, and that he could retain his Late Night sidekick, Steve Higgins, and house band, The Roots. NBC agreed, spending some 5 million to renovate 30 Rock's Studio 6B — the same one in which Fallon had shot Late Night, and Carson used to host The Tonight Show — into The Tonight Show's new home, which now could seat 240. Retitled The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Fallon's program debuted on Feb. 17, 2014, and was a hit off the bat, thanks largely to its youthful host, a true variety performer who could and would sing and dance and clown around with anyone. Thanks to segments like \\"Lip Sync Battle\\" (which soon spawned its own spinoff show), \\"Thank You Notes\\" and \\"Battle of the Instant Songwriters,\\" the show shot to the top of the late-night ratings and became a perennial Emmy nominee for best variety series, landing nominations in the summers of 2014, 2015 and 2016. Then came the Trump interview, the scathing criticism and the piling on. A month after Trump's visit, the New York Post ran a story suggesting that Fallon's \\"boozing\\" had gotten \\"out of control\\" and was responsible for several freak injuries that he had suffered in 2015. Then, two months after Trump's visit, Trump beat Hillary Clinton (whose hair Fallon had ruffled on his show the night after Trump stopped by), by winning the presidency, which only further fueled anger towards Fallon. And, ever since Trump assumed office in January 2017, as the entire country has become more politicized, Fallon's show has lost more than one-fifth of its audience and been passed in the ratings by Stephen Colbert's new and more political The Late Show for CBS, while a more politically outspoken Jimmy Kimmel has also propelled ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! to major gains in viewers. \\"The ratings never bothered me,\\" Fallon insists. \\"I don't really care about the ratings. I never will. That's someone else's job at NBC.\\" Then, a year ago, to add insult to injury, the TV Academy nominated Colbert and Kimmel's programs for best variety series, but not Fallon's. \\"It was definitely a down time,\\" Fallon somberly says of the period after Trump's last appearance on his show. \\"And it's tough for morale. There's 300 people that work here, and so when people are talking that bad about you and ganging up on you, in a really gang-mentality...\\" Choking up, he continues, \\"You go, 'Alright, we get it. I heard you. You made me feel bad. So now what? Are you happy? I'm depressed. Do you want to push me more? What do you want me to do? You want me to kill myself? What would make you happy? Get over it.'\\" Fallon adds, \\"I'm sorry. I don't want to make anyone angry — I never do and I never will. It's all in the fun of the show. I made a mistake. I'm sorry if I made anyone mad. And, looking back, I would do it differently.\\" Looking back is not a luxury that Fallon often affords himself — he very rarely grants interviews — because of how busy he is with his wife and two young daughters, and how much time it takes to make quality episodes of TV every weekday. \\"You have another show tomorrow, so I can't really freak out,\\" Fallon says, and so, he acknowledges, he slaps on a smile even when he's feeling down or sick. To his credit, now, as much as ever, he can be counted on to make funny episodes that lead to widespread conversation and coverage (recent examples include one that he co-hosted with Cardi B on April 9 and another that was essentially taken over by Ariana Grande on May 1), and he still makes time to let loose away from the show (making a May 5 cameo on SNL as Jared Kushner and posting to Instagram a goofy music video that he made with Lin-Manuel Miranda on June 1). But now, maybe more than ever before, Fallon also shows his serious side, both on the show (delivering emotional monologues after the deadly events in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 14, and the passing of his mom, on Nov. 13) and off it: He sponsored buses to — and he and his family attended — the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., on March 24, and he gave the commencement address at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School's graduation ceremony in Parkland, Florida, on June 3. Twenty-one months after Trump's visit to The Tonight Show, the fallout from it clearly still weighs on Fallon. But nearly 21 years after the host first came to NBC — \\"Al Roker's probably the only guy that has more time than me,\\" he cracks — he has no doubts that he pursued the right path in life. \\"I love what I do,\\" Fallon says. \\"I'm lucky to work with the people I work with. And I hope I get to do this for as long as people are watching.\\" ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

This antique vase can never be replaced.","completion":"To determine whether the word \\"replace\\" is used in the same way in the two sentences, let's analyze each sentence and identify the meaning of \\"replace\\" in each context. Sentence 1: The insurance will replace the lost income. Step 1: Identify the subject and object - Here, the subject is 'insurance,' and the object is 'lost income.' Step 2: Understand the context - In this case, the context is talking about insurance coverage, where the insurance provides financial compensation. Step 3: Determine the meaning of 'replace' - In this context, \\"replace\\" means to provide a substitute or to compensate for something that has been lost, specifically income. Sentence 2: This antique vase can never be replaced. Step 1: Identify the subject and object - In this sentence, the subject is 'antique vase,' and there is no direct object as it is a passive voice statement. Step 2: Understand the context - The context here is about an irreplaceable antique vase, which cannot be substituted by another item of equal value or significance. Step 3: Determine the meaning of 'replace' - In this context, \\"replace\\" means to find an identical, equally valuable or significant substitute for the antique vase. Now, let's compare the meanings of \\"replace\\" in both sentences: In sentence 1, \\"replace\\" refers to the insurance compensating for lost income, whereas, in sentence 2, \\"replace\\" refers to finding an equally valuable or significant substitute for an antique vase. After analyzing the meaning of \\"replace\\" in both contexts, I conclude that the word \\"replace\\" is not used in exactly the same way in both sentences.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: what is the name that is given to a symbiotic relationship?","completion":"A symbiotic relationship, in the context of ecology and biology, refers to the close, long-term interaction between two different species, with each species providing benefits that support the survival and well-being of the other. This type of relationship is an essential component of various ecosystems, as it plays a significant role in maintaining ecological balance and facilitating the coexistence of species. There are several types of symbiotic relationships, each characterized by varying degrees of beneficial, harmful, or neutral effects on the species involved. The main categories of symbiotic relationships include mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. 1. Mutualism: In this type of symbiotic relationship, both species benefit from the interaction. Mutualistic relationships are incredibly common in nature and can provide essential resources, protection, or other advantages for the species involved. Examples of mutualism include: - Bees and flowering plants: Bees collect nectar as a food source from flowers, and in the process, they help in pollination by transferring pollen from one flower to another, thereby promoting plant reproduction. - Clownfish and sea anemones: Clownfish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, which provide them with protection from predators. In return, clownfish drive away polyp-eating fish and provide nutrients through their waste. 2. Commensalism: In a commensal relationship, one species benefits without either harming or particularly benefiting the other species. This type of symbiotic relationship may involve a commensal organism using the host species for physical support, habitat, or transportation. Examples of commensalism include: - Orchids and trees: Epiphytic orchids grow on tree branches without causing harm to the tree. They use the tree for support and access to sunlight, while their host benefits neither positively nor negatively from their presence. - Remoras and sharks: Remoras are small fish that attach themselves to sharks and feed on the leftover scraps from the shark's meals. The remoras benefit from the shark's hunting, while the shark is neither harmed nor helped by the remoras presence. 3. Parasitism: This type of symbiotic relationship involves one species, the parasite, benefiting at the expense of the other species, the host. Parasites cause harm to the host organism by feeding on their tissues, nutrients, or energy and can lead to various diseases or even death. Examples of parasitism include: - Fleas and ticks on dogs: Both fleas and ticks feed on the dog's blood, causing irritation, discomfort, and potentially transmitting diseases. While the parasites benefit from the nourishment and shelter the host provides, the host suffers from the adverse effects of the infestation. - Mistletoe on trees: Mistletoe is a parasitic plant that attaches to trees and absorbs some of their nutrients and water, causing harm to the host tree. The mistletoe benefits from the resources it extracts, but the host tree is harmed due to reduced access to essential nutrients and water. In summary, the name given to a symbiotic relationship depends on the nature of the interaction between the species involved. Mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism are the primary categories of symbiotic relationships, each characterized by unique benefits or consequences for the species engaged in the relationship. These interactions are dynamic and essential components of ecosystems, demonstrating the intricate connections that exist between organisms in various habitats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The introduction of sugar-free desserts will likely have an indirect effect on the regulation of blood sugar levels. Since sugar-free desserts contain little or no sugar, consuming them will result in less sugar entering the bloodstream, thus reducing the need for the pancreas to produce insulin to lower blood sugar levels.

Article:","completion":"Title: A Step-By-Step Guide to Safely and Effectively Performing an Enema Introduction An enema is a medical procedure that involves the introduction of liquid into the rectum, primarily to relieve constipation or to cleanse the colon before a medical examination. While enemas can be administered at home, it is essential to complete the entire process carefully and correctly to prevent any potential complications or discomfort. This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to purchase an appropriate enema, use a lubricated syringe correctly, and prepare your environment and materials effectively. Step 1: Purchase an Appropriate Enema There are various enema kits available on the market, and choosing the right one depends on your individual needs, preferences, and medical requirements. The first step is to determine the type of enema that is most suitable for you. Common types of enemas include saline solution enemas, mineral oil enemas, and water-based enemas. To ensure that you purchase a safe and high-quality product, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before making your purchase. They can provide guidance on the most appropriate enema type, as well as recommend trusted manufacturers and brands. Some pharmacies and medical supply stores also carry enema kits, which are generally safer alternatives to those available online. Step 2: Use a Correct, Lubricated Syringe Using the correct syringe is an essential component of the enema process, as it minimizes discomfort and the possibility of injury. A lubricated syringe is specifically designed for rectal insertion, featuring a smooth, rounded tip and pre-lubricated nozzle. Before starting the procedure, ensure that the enema solution is at room temperature, gently mixed, and that any air bubbles have been eliminated. Carefully insert the lubricated syringe into the rectum, making sure not to force it in. An insertion of about 1-2 inches will suffice; pushing it further may cause injury. Once the syringe has been inserted, slowly and steadily release the enema solution into the rectum. Step 3: Prepare Your Environment and Materials Preparing the environment and materials before performing an enema is crucial for a smooth, comfortable, and hygienic experience. Consider the following suggestions to effectively prepare your enema setup: 1. Choose a clean and private space: To maintain hygiene and comfort, pick a spot that is both clean and free from interruption or disturbance. 2. Gather essential supplies: Assemble all required supplies, such as the enema kit, towels, gloves, and lubricant, before beginning the procedure. 3. Protect the flooring: To avoid potential messes, place a waterproof sheet or large towel on the floor where you'll be lying down during the enema. 4. Use gloves: Wearing disposable gloves can help prevent contamination and ensure a more hygienic procedure. 5. Clean and disinfect materials: Prior to use, clean the syringe, tube, and nozzle of the enema kit thoroughly following the manufacturer's instructions. Conclusion Performing an enema safely and effectively requires careful planning, the right supplies, and adherence to proper techniques. By purchasing an appropriate enema, using a lubricated syringe, and preparing your environment and materials meticulously, you can ensure a comfortable and successful enema experience. Always consult with a healthcare professional before administering an enema, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or concerns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Looking to express your personality and creativity through your clothing? Airbrushing t-shirts is an art form that has gained popularity in recent years, allowing individuals to create custom-made, unique designs that reflect their personal style. With just a few materials and some understanding of the technique, you can master the art of airbrushing and transform your wardrobe. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of airbrushing a t-shirt, step by step. Materials Before we begin, you'll need the following items: 1. A t-shirt 2. An airbrush and appropriate compressor 3. Airbrush paint 4. A stencil (optional) 5. Cardboard or a t-shirt board (to insert inside the shirt) 6. Masking tape or adhesive spray (to secure the stencil) 7. A well-ventilated workspace 8. Protective gear (gloves, mask, and goggles) Step 1: Set up the T-Shirt Find a suitable location for airbrushing, preferably a well-ventilated workspace to avoid inhaling paint fumes. Lay your t-shirt flat on your work surface and insert a piece of cardboard or a t-shirt board inside. This will prevent paint from bleeding through to the other side and provide a stable surface to work on. Step 2: Position the Stencil (Optional) If you're using a stencil to create a specific design or pattern, position it on the desired area of the t-shirt. You can use masking tape or adhesive spray to secure the stencil and ensure sharp edges. Make sure the stencil lays flat against the t-shirt to avoid paint seeping under the edges. Step 3: Prepare Your Airbrush Fill your airbrush with your desired paint color. Remember to start with lighter colors and gradually move on to darker ones. Ensure that your airbrush is connected to a suitable compressor, and adjust the pressure settings according to the instruction manual or your personal preference. Step 4: Spray the T-Shirt Hold the airbrush about six inches away from the shirt, and begin spraying even, overlapping strokes across the surface. Keep the airbrush moving steadily, and avoid spraying too much paint in one spot, as this can cause the paint to drip or become uneven. Continue spraying until you achieve the desired coverage and design. Step 5: Switch Colors as Needed To add depth and dimension to your design, switch colors as needed. Always start with lighter colors, and gradually build up to darker ones. Clean your airbrush thoroughly between color changes to avoid mixing or contaminating the colors. Step 6: Carefully Remove the Stencil Once you've completed your design and the paint has dried slightly, carefully remove the stencil from the t-shirt. If you used masking tape or adhesive spray, gently lift the edges of the stencil to avoid smudging the paint. Step 7: Add Freehand Designs (Optional) If you want to further personalize your t-shirt and showcase your artistic skills, add freehand designs using your airbrush. Use different colors and techniques, such as shading or highlighting, to create visually striking patterns. Step 8: Allow the Paint to Dry Allow the t-shirt to dry completely, as recommended by the paint manufacturer. This may take anywhere from a few hours to overnight. Once the paint is thoroughly dry, you can wear your custom airbrushed t-shirt with pride! Conclusion Airbrushing t-shirts is a fun and creative way to express your individuality and add a unique flair to your wardrobe. With a little practice and the right tools, you can create stunning, one-of-a-kind designs that will set you apart from the crowd.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general. Considered an underdog, Kaine trailed in polls for most of the election but won the race. He... Question: Who ran for governor of Virginia?

Options: - texas - michigan - kansas city - maine - ohio The answer is \\"maine\\" because The answer is:","completion":"Maine, because it is the only state among the given options that has direct access to the Atlantic Ocean, where lobsters are abundantly found. Maine is well-known for its lobster industry, providing not only the local area but also other states and countries with fresh lobsters. The coastal waters off the coast of Maine are considered to be among the most productive lobster grounds in the world. In fact, Maine's coastal region supplies more than 80% of the United States' lobster catch. The state's geographic location, climate, and ecosystem create the perfect environment for lobsters to thrive. Maine's coastal waters contain a high concentration of phytoplankton, which serves as the primary food source for lobsters. The temperature of the water around Maine is also ideal for lobsters, as they prefer colder water temperatures ranging between 40-50°F. There are several reasons why Maine's lobster industry is so successful and why steakhouses in Maine can offer fresh-caught lobster: 1. Proximity to the coast: With thousands of miles of coastline, Maine has ample access to lobster fishing areas. This makes it easy for fishermen and suppliers to quickly and efficiently catch, process, and deliver fresh lobsters to steakhouses in the state. 2. Sustainable fishing practices: The state of Maine is committed to maintaining a healthy and sustainable lobster population. Through strict regulations on lobster fishing, such as implementing size limits, prohibiting the taking of egg-bearing females, and limiting the number of lobster traps, Maine ensures that the lobster population remains stable and continues to be a reliable source for delicious seafood. 3. Quality and freshness: Due to its coast-to-table approach, Maine's steakhouses can offer the freshest lobster dishes possible. Freshly caught lobsters are typically prepared and served within a short time, ensuring that the taste and quality of the lobster remains at its peak. 4. Culinary reputation: Maine has earned a strong reputation for its seafood, particularly its lobsters. Maine lobster is widely regarded as some of the best in the world. This reputation attracts locals and tourists alike to try the authentic Maine lobster experience at steakhouses and seafood restaurants throughout the state. 5. Economic impact: The lobster industry plays a significant role in Maine's economy. As a result, the locals take great pride in supplying and serving high-quality, fresh-caught lobsters to customers. Steakhouses in Maine are well-supported by the local community and visitors alike, ensuring a continued demand for fresh seafood. In contrast, Texas, Michigan, Kansas City, and Ohio do not have the same access and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, where lobsters are found in large numbers. These states may still offer lobster dishes on their menus, but the likelihood of it being fresh-caught decreases significantly. Therefore, the obvious answer out of the given options is Maine, as it is the only state where steakhouses can offer fresh-caught lobster due to its ideal geographic location, sustainable fishing practices, and well-established lobster industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are several reasons for this, based on the information provided in the review: 1. The title of the review, \\"False Advertising, Horrible Film,\\" immediately gives a strong negative impression about the product. The reviewer is implying that the marketing materials for the movie do not accurately represent what the movie is about, which may lead potential buyers to feel misled. 2. The reviewer states that this movie is \\"easily one of the worst movies\\" they have ever seen and compares it to another poorly received film, \\"Freddy got Fingered.\\" By offering this comparison, the reviewer further emphasizes their opinion that this is a low-quality product. 3. The reviewer's experience also highlights the movie's shortcomings in terms of genre expectation, as they rented the movie hoping for a comedy to watch with their girlfriend but ended up being disappointed. This suggests that the movie might not meet the expectations of those looking for a lighthearted, entertaining experience. 4. The review criticizes the movie for trying to be a \\"trippy Tarantino-esque flick\\" and failing miserably. This indicates that the movie might be attempting to imitate a popular and acclaimed director's style but does not achieve the desired effect. This can be off-putting for potential buyers who might be fans of Quentin Tarantino. 5.

These critiques highlight major issues with the movie's storyline and character development, which are important aspects to consider when deciding whether to buy a film. 6. Lastly, the reviewer believes that the movie tries to make an artistic statement without making an effort to be entertaining. This suggests that the film may prioritize style over substance, which can be a negative aspect for those looking for a movie that engages them and keeps their interest throughout.

These mechanisms respond to various internal and external factors, such as the availability of oxygen and carbon dioxide, light intensity, and temperature. Feedback mechanisms help plants optimize their energy production and consumption, ensuring that they can adapt to changing environmental conditions and efficiently use their resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its tasteful decor and warm setting welcomed us, providing an intimate and relaxing atmosphere that eloquently set the tone for the evening ahead. Let's dig into the food because my words probably won't do justice to the culinary craftsmanship at work here. I started with the seasonal Gnocchi, deliciously soft yet firm with a delightful cheese filling, that was complemented well by the subtly sweet butternut squash purée. My dining companion had the Scallop Crudo, which was refined and refreshing, highlighting the natural flavors of the seafood. For my main course, I opted for the Roasted Duck. It was nothing short of a masterpiece. The meat was tender, succulent, and perfectly cooked, glazed in a glossy layer of a mildly sweet sauce that just enhanced the already superb flavor of the duck. The accompanying vegetables were crisp, retaining their nutrients and natural taste and rounding up the whole dish superbly. My companion had the Lobster Risotto which was, in one word, divine. The risotto was creamy, rich and bursting with the most mouthwatering flavors. The lobster chunks were generous and cooked to perfection. The service merits a special mention. Our server was delightfully personable and attentive without being overly intrusive. She was knowledgeable about the menu, kindly advised us on wine pairings, and made us feel exceptional throughout the entire dining experience. Rounding off our dinner was the heavenly Chocolate Lava Cake. The cake was warm, moist, and when it was sliced open, it released a river of molten goodness that was just the right balance of sweetness.

Larry Hagman, born Larry Martin Hageman on September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth, Texas, was an American actor, producer, and director. He started his acting career in the 1950s with theater productions and minor roles in TV shows. He gained fame for his portrayal of Tony Nelson on \\"I Dream of Jeannie,\\" which was created by Sidney Sheldon. In the show, Tony Nelson accidentally releases Jeannie, played by the talented Barbara Eden, from her bottle. Jeannie is grateful to Tony for her freedom and becomes his protector from various mishaps. The sitcom follows the comedic adventures of Tony and Jeannie as they navigate their lives with the added complexity of a magical genie. The on-screen chemistry between Larry Hagman and Barbara Eden was undeniable, and the two actors became close friends off-set. While \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" made Hagman a popular television star, it was his role as J.R. Ewing in the long-running primetime drama \\"Dallas\\" (1978-1991) that cemented his legacy as one of TV's most iconic actors. In \\"Dallas,\\" Hagman played a Texas oil tycoon whose vicious business tactics and scheming ways led to the series becoming a massive hit, earning him two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He reprised his famous role in the 2012 reboot of \\"Dallas\\" before his unfortunate demise due to complications from leukemia on November 23, 2012.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Christian democracy is a political ideology which emerged in nineteenth-century Europe under the influence of conservatism and Catholic social teaching, as well as Neo-Calvinism. It was originally conceived as a combination of traditional Catholic beliefs and modern democratic ideas, and it grew to incorporate the social teaching of other Christian denominations, such as the Lutheran Church and the Reformed Church. After World War II, the Protestant and Catholic movements of the Social Gospel and Neo-Thomism, respectively, played a role in shaping Christian democracy. Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, although it is present in other parts of the world too. - The Centrist Democrat International is Christian Democrat political international. Until 2001 it was known as the Christian Democrat International (CDI) and before that the \\"Christian Democrat and People's Parties International\\" (until 1999) (this earlier name is, since October 2000, still sometimes used colloquially). It was formed in 1961 in Santiago, Chile as the \\"Christian Democrat World Union\\", building on the legacy of other Christian Democrat internationals who tried to create a Christian-inspired third way alternative to the socialist internationals; in 1982 it was renamed for the first time Christian Democrat International. The name officially changed due to the participation of groups of various faiths. It is the global international political group dedicated to the promotion of Christian democracy. Although it gathers parties from around the globe, its members are drawn principally from Europe and Latin America. Some of them are also members of the International Democrat Union (IDU), although the CDI is closer to the political centre and more communitarian than the IDU. - A European political party (formally, a political party at European level; informally a Europarty) is a type of political party organisation operating transnationally in Europe and in the institutions of the European Union. They are regulated and funded by the European Union and are usually made up of national parties, not individuals. Europarties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections and express themselves within the European Parliament by their affiliated political groups and their MEPs. Europarties, through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government, influence the decision-making process of the European Council. Europarties also work closely and co-ordinate with their affiliated members of the European Commission and, according to the Lisbon Treaty the Europarty that wins the European elections has the right to nominate to the European Council its candidate for President of the European Commission. - The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a global inter-parliamentary institution established in 1889 by Frédéric Passy (France) and William Randal Cremer (United Kingdom). It was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, the organization was for individual parliamentarians, but has since transformed into an international organization of the parliaments of sovereign states. The national parliaments of 170 countries are members of the IPU, and 11 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members. The IPU has permanent observer status at the United Nations General Assembly and general consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. - Santiago de Chile is the capital and largest city of Chile. It is also the center of its largest conurbation. Santiago is located in the country's central valley, at an elevation of above mean sea level. - The European People's Party (EPP) is a European political party. A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties, not individuals. Founded by primarily Christian democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives. - Lorenzo Cesa (born 16 August 1951 in Arcinazzo Romano, Rome) is an Italian politician, and was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 2006 General election representing the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats. He was elected on October 27, 2005 as new party leader, replacing resigning secretary Marco Follini. - The Union of the Centre ( Italian : Unione di Centro , UdC ) is a Christian democratic political party in Italy . Its secretary is Lorenzo Cesa , but its most popular figure and actual leader is Pier Ferdinando Casini . The party is a member of the European People 's Party and the Centrist Democrat International , of which Casini is president . The party was formed in December 2002 as the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats ( Unione dei Democratici Cristiani e di Centro , UDC ) as the merger of the Christian Democratic Centre , the United Christian Democrats and European Democracy . In 2008 the party was the driving force behind the UdC , an alliance comprising , among others , The Rose for Italy , the Populars for the Constituent Assembly of the Centre , the Liberal Clubs , the Party of Christian Democracy , Christian Democratic Party , Veneto for the European People 's Party , the Democratic Populars and the Autonomist Democrats . Since then , the party 's official name was neglected in favour of \`\` Union of the Centre '' and , since most of the UdC member parties have joined the UDC too , the UDC and the UdC started to overlap almost completely to the point that they are now undistinguishable .

Sage, also known as Tessa, is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe. She has most often been associated with the X-Men and the Hellfire Club, whom she spied upon for Professor Charles Xavier. A mutant, Sage possesses a number of mental abilities and was originally presented as the personal assistant to the Hellfire Club's Sebastian Shaw, but an extended retcon revealed that she was one of the first mutants discovered by Professor Xavier. She has been a member of the original X-Men teams, Excalibur, the Exiles, and a cross-dimensional X-Men team similar to the Exiles known as the X-Treme X-Men. Years later, Sage meets up again with Xavier, who at the time is recruiting the original X-Men. Instead of being chosen for the first X-Men class, she is instead sent to spy on the Hellfire Club as Tessa, and to keep watch on Sebastian Shaw, something which returns to haunt her in the following years. While working at the Hellfire Club she encounters Psylocke, Jean Grey, and Emma Frost, who at this point is the White Queen. While she is able to successfully warn Psylocke away from the Hellfire Club, Tessa is later remorseful that she is unable to similarly prevent the corruption of Phoenix into the Black Queen. This transformation is a key factor in the creation of Dark Phoenix. Sometime during Tessa's time with the Hellfire Club, Sebastian Shaw and Emma Frost dare the man known as Elias Bogan to wager in a game of poker. Though he holds no official rank in the Inner Circle, the telepathic Bogan is one of the Club's most important and powerful members; his patronage guarantees success in the organization. By the terms of the wager, if Shaw lost, Frost would \\"belong\\" to Bogan, but if Bogan's agent lost, then his fortune would be turned over to Shaw. Thanks to Tessa's advice and analytical skills, Bogan loses the game and is forced to honor the wager. Having never lost before, Bogan harbors a grudge against Tessa. During the X-Men's initial conflicts with the Hellfire Club, Tessa primarily maintains a background role and is seen as only Shaw's unusually intelligent assistant. Hints of her more complex role are indicated when she and Xavier are kidnapped by Donald Pierce, a renegade member of the club, with grudges against both organizations. Based on the interactions between Xavier and Tessa, it is unclear whether he is helping to maintain her cover or whether he feels as if he has lost his agent, since the interaction between the two is kept impersonal. The two are rescued by the nascent team of New Mutants, and Tessa takes Pierce into custody on behalf of the Hellfire Club. Tessa's next notable interaction with Xavier's students happens months later when the X-Men and Hellfire Club are hunting down Rachel Summers after her attempted murder of Selene, the newly installed Black Queen. In the middle of their fight, both teams are taken by surprise by Nimrod, a mutant-hunting robot from the future. Recognizing the more immediate threat, the two groups join forces and are able to severely damage Nimrod. The X-Men and Hellfire Club each sustain heavy losses and are forced to flee the scene quickly. Tessa offers Storm and the X-Men temporary sanctuary with the Club, which later results in Magneto and Storm jointly accepting the role of White King in the Inner Circle. So she created Dark Phoenix?","completion":"No, Sage, also known as Tessa, did not create Dark Phoenix. Dark Phoenix is a transformation of Jean Grey, who is another character in the Marvel Comics universe. When Jean Grey was corrupted by the Hellfire Club, she transformed into the Black Queen, which later played a big role in her becoming the Dark Phoenix. While Sage was involved in some events surrounding this transformation, she was not responsible for the creation of Dark Phoenix."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Information: - Brewing is the production of beer by steeping a starch source (commonly cereal grains, the most popular of which is barley) in water and fermenting the resulting sweet liquid with yeast. It may be done in a brewery by a commercial brewer, at home by a homebrewer, or by a variety of traditional methods such as communally by the indigenous peoples in Brazil when making cauim. Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that emerging civilizations including ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia brewed beer. Since the nineteenth century the brewing industry has been part of most western economies. - Russian River Brewing Company is a brewery and brewpub in downtown Santa Rosa , California . The company makes strong India pale ales and sour beers . - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism. - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - A brewery or brewing company is a business that makes and sells beer. The place at which beer is commercially made is either called a brewery or a beerhouse, where distinct sets of brewing equipment are called plant. The commercial brewing of beer has taken place since at least 2500 BC; in ancient Mesopotamia, brewers derived social sanction and divine protection from the goddess Ninkasi. Brewing was initially a cottage industry, with production taking place at home; by the ninth century monasteries and farms would produce beer on a larger scale, selling the excess; and by the eleventh and twelfth centuries larger, dedicated breweries with eight to ten workers were being built. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.

Given the question: Information: - Austrofascism was the authoritarian rule installed in Austria with the May Constitution of 1934, which ceased with the annexation of the newly founded Federal State of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938. It was based on a ruling party, the Fatherland Front (\\"Vaterländische Front\\") and the Heimwehr (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were Engelbert Dollfuss and, after Dollfuss's assassination, Kurt Schuschnigg, who were previously politicians of the Christian Social Party, which was quickly integrated into the new movement. - Engelbert Dollfuss (; October 4, 1892 July 25, 1934) was an Austrian Christian Social and Patriotic Front statesman. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the Austrian Nazi party and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934, he cemented the rule of austrofascism through the authoritarian \\"First of May Constitution\\". Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents in 1934. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitlers annexation of Austria in 1938. - The Kingdom of Italy was a state founded from 1861, when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy, to 1946, when a constitutional referendum led civil discontent to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic. The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state. - The Heimwehr (\\"Home Guard\\") or sometimes Heimatschutz (\\"Homeland Protection\\") were a nationalist, initially paramilitary group operating within Austria during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's Freikorps. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the Heimatblock, which cooperated with Engelbert Dollfuss' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the Fatherland Front by decree of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the \\"Frontmiliz\\". - Italian Fascism, also known simply as Fascism, is the original fascist ideology, as developed in Italy. The ideology is associated with the National Fascist Party, which under Benito Mussolini ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 until 1943, the Republican Fascist Party that ruled the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945, the post-war Italian Social Movement and subsequent Italian neo-fascist movements. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before it spread to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional leftright spectrum. - The National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\", PNF) was an Italian political party, created by Benito Mussolini as the political expression of fascism (previously represented by groups known as \\"Fasci\\"). The party ruled Italy from 1922 when Fascists took power with the March on Rome, to 1943, when Mussolini was deposed by the Grand Council of Fascism. - Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (29 July 1883 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\"; PNF), ruling the country as Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943. He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Known as \\"Il Duce\\" (The Leader), Mussolini was the founder of Italian Fascism. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg (14 December 1897 18 November 1977) was Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 \\"Anschluss\\" with Nazi Germany. He was opposed to Hitler's ambitions to absorb Austria into the Third Reich. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - The Italian Social Republic, informally known as the Republic of Salò, was a state with limited recognition that was created during the later part of World War II (in existence from 1943 until 1945). Mussolini had originally intended to call his new republic the Italian Socialist Republic. It was the second and last incarnation of the Fascist Italian state and was led by Duce Benito Mussolini and his reformed Republican Fascist Party. The state declared Rome as its capital, but was \\"de facto\\" centered on Salò (hence its colloquial name), a small town on Lake Garda, near Brescia, where Mussolini and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was headquartered. The RSI exercised nominal sovereignty in northern and central Italy, but was largely dependent on German troops to maintain control. - The Republican Fascist Party (PFR) was a political party led by Benito Mussolini during the German occupation of Central and Northern Italy. It was founded as the successor of former National Fascist Party as an anti-monarchist party. It considered King Victor Emmanuel III to be a traitor after he had signed the surrender to the Allied powers. - The Fatherland Front ( German : Vaterländische Front , VF ) was the ruling political organisation of \`\` Austrofascism '' . It claimed to be a nonpartisan movement , and aimed to unite all the people of Austria , overcoming political and social divisions . Established on 20 May 1933 by Christian Social Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss as a one - party along the lines of Italian Fascism , it advocated Austrian nationalism and independence from Nazi Germany on the basis of protecting Austria 's Catholic religious identity from what they considered a Protestant - dominated German state . The Fatherland Front which was strongly linked with Austria 's Catholic clergy , absorbed Dollfuss 's Christian Social Party , the agrarian Landbund and the right - wing paramilitary Heimwehren , all of which were opposed to socialism , free - market capitalism and liberal democracy . It established an authoritarian and corporatist regime , the Federal State of Austria , which is commonly known in German as the Ständestaat ( \`\` corporate state '' ) . According to the Fatherland Front , this form of government and society implemented the social teaching of Pope Pius XI 's 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo anno . The Front banned and persecuted all its political opponents , including Communists , Social Democrats -- who fought against it in a brief Civil War in February 1934 -- but also the Austrian Nazis who wanted Austria to join Hitler 's Greater German Empire . Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated by the Nazis in July 1934 . He was succeeded as leader of the VF and Chancellor of Austria by Kurt Schuschnigg , who ruled until the invigorated Nazis forced him to resign on 11 March 1938 .

Following two consecutive losses to Dallas and San Diego, Philadelphia went to Chicago to take on the Chicago Bears, who were 4-5, on Sunday Night Football. The Eagles dominated the first quarter as Philadelphia took a two score lead on a 25-yard field goal by David Akers and a 13-yard touchdown from Donovan McNabb to Jason Avant on a wide receiver screen pass. Down 10-0 at the start of the second quarter, Chicago drove within one point as Bears kicker Robbie Gould successfully made a 45-yard field goal, as well as a pair of 28-yard field goals, to make the score 10-9 at the half. In the second half, the Bears took the lead as Robbie Gould kicked his fourth field goal, a 49-yarder that put Chicago up 12-10. However, it took only 30 seconds for the Eagles to take the lead as Donovan McNabb passed to DeSean Jackson for a 48-yard touchdown to give the Eagles a 17-12 lead. Ironically, the 48-yard touchdown catch was the shortest touchdown scored by Jackson thus far in the season. Chicago again took the lead in the third quarter as struggling quarterback Jay Cutler, who had already missed several wide open targets in the game, passed to tight end Kellen Davis for a 15-yard score. The Bears converted the 2-point conversion attempt as running back Matt Forte scored on the pass from Cutler to put the Bears back on top 20-17. In the fourth quarter, both defenses fought back and forth but the only points of the final period were scored by Eagles running back LeSean McCoy on a 10-yard, game-winning touchdown run to put the Eagles up 24-20, the game's final score. With the win, the Eagles improved to 6-4. Ironically, the Eagles win came by the same score (24-20) in the same city (Chicago) at the same time and venue (Sunday Night Football on NBC) as when they had lost in week 4 of the 2008 season.

Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A tender woman, or an independent one, which one would you prefer? Arecent research shows that most people would choose the latter. This type of woman is called a nuhanzi (\\"tough woman\\"). Experts believe these characteristics have social and psychological roots among young femalesin China. Su Hao's friends all call her a tough woman, because she can finish tough tasks usually carried out by men. For example, she carries 10-litre water to her dormitory on the 5th floor. \\"I depend on no one but myself,\\" she says. According to a recent survey by China Youth Daily, tough women have become rather common in society. Of the 21,265 respondents, 78.5 percent said they are familiar with a tough woman. About 50 percent said they like women with tough characteristics, while less than 29 percent expressed the opposite view. Why are tough women gaining popularity? Shen Meng, a psychological consultant, believes the fierce competition in society is contributing to this trend. \\"Women are often in a disadvantaged position compared to men,\\" Shen says. \\"In order to survive, they have to be independent, strong and tough.\\" Liu Xiao lin, professor of psychology at Wuhan Mental Health Center, believes tough women are brought up this way.

It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous. - Manacus is a genus of passerine birds in the manakin family which are found in the forests of tropical mainland Central and South America , and on Trinidad and Tobago . There are four species . White - collared manakin , Manacus candei Orange - collared manakin , Manacus aurantiacus Golden - collared manakin , Manacus vitellinus White - bearded manakin , Manacus manacus The \`\` Almirante manakin '' ( Manacus x cerritus ) are stereotyped hybrids between the white - collared and the golden - collared species , found in Bocas del Toro Province , Panama ( Brumfield et al. , 2001 ; McDonald et al. , 2001 ) . These are small , compact , short - tailed birds with a heavy hooked bill and orange legs . The males have brightly coloured plumage and long puffed throat feathers , whereas the females are the typical manakin dull olive hue . The females lay two eggs in a shallow cup nest in a tree . Nest - building , incubation for 18 -- 21 days , and care of the young are undertaken by the female alone , since manakins do not form stable pairs . Manacus manakins feed low in the trees on fruit and some insects , both plucked from the foliage in flight . Like some other manakin species , this genus has spectacular courtship rituals , in which the males give communal displays in a specially prepared lek . The males jump with their throat feathers erected to form a beard , and give whistles together with the characteristic loud snaps ( like a breaking twig ) and various buzzing , rustling and whiffling noises made with the wings . The males of three very closely related species , the white - collared manakin of the Caribbean slopes of Central America , and its Pacific counterparts , the orange - collared and golden - collared manakins , have heavily modified wings with the five outer primaries very narrow for their outer half , and the inner primaries thickened and bowed . - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Brood parasites are organisms that rely on others to raise their young. The strategy appears among birds, insects and some fish. The brood parasite manipulates a host, either of the same or of another species, to raise its young as if it were its own. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The cuckoos are a family of birds, Cuculidae, the sole taxon in the order Cuculiformes. The cuckoo family includes the common or European cuckoo, roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis. The coucals and anis are sometimes separated as distinct families, the Centropodidae and Crotophagidae respectively. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - The cuckoo-finch (\\"Anomalospiza imberbis\\"), also known as the parasitic weaver or cuckoo weaver, is a small passerine bird now placed in the family Viduidae with the indigobirds and whydahs. It occurs in grassland in Africa south of the Sahara. The male is mainly yellow and green while the female is buff with dark streaks. The eggs are laid in the nests of other birds. - Tobago is an autonomous island within the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is located northeast of the mainland of Trinidad and southeast of Grenada. The island lies outside the hurricane belt. According to the earliest English-language source cited in the \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\", Tobago bore a name that has become the English word \\"tobacco.\\" The national bird of Tobago is the cocrico. - Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus \\"Nicotiana\\" and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. While more than 70 species of tobacco are known, the chief commercial crop is \\"N. tabacum\\". The more potent variant \\"N. rustica\\" is also used around the world. - Shrikes are carnivorous passerine birds of the family Laniidae. The family is composed of thirty-one species in four genera. They are fairly closely related to the bush-shrike family Malaconotidae. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Cowbirds are birds belonging to the genus Molothrus in the family Icteridae. They are brood parasitic New World birds which are unrelated to the Old World cuckoos, one of which, the common cuckoo, is the most famous brood parasitic bird. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - Passer is a genus of sparrows, also known as the true sparrows. The genus includes the house sparrow and the Eurasian tree sparrow, some of the most common birds in the world. They are small birds with thick bills for eating seeds, and are mostly coloured grey or brown. Native to the Old World, some species have been introduced throughout the world. - The manakins are a clade (Pipridae) of small suboscine passerine birds. The group contains some 60 species distributed through the American tropics. The name is from Middle Dutch \\"mannekijn\\" \\"little man\\" (also the source of the different bird name \\"mannikin\\"). - Trinidad (Spanish: \\"Trinity\\") is the larger and more populous of the two major islands and numerous landforms which make up the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. The island lies off the northeastern coast of Venezuela and sits on the continental shelf of South America. Though geographically part of the South American continent, from a socio-economic standpoint it is often referred to as the southernmost island in the Caribbean. With an area of , it is also the sixth largest in the West Indies. - A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin \\"oscen\\", \\"a songbird\\". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The order Squamata, or the scaled reptiles, are the largest recent order of reptiles, comprising all lizards and snakes. With over 10,000 species, it is also the second-largest order of extant vertebrates, after the perciform fish, and roughly equal in number to the Saurischia (one of the 2 major groups of dinosaurs). Members of the order are distinguished by their skins, which bear horny scales or shields. They also possess movable quadrate bones, making it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the neurocranium. This is particularly visible in snakes, which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey. They are the most variably sized order of reptiles, ranging from the dwarf gecko (\\"Sphaerodactylus ariasae\\") to the green anaconda (\\"Eunectes murinus\\") and the now-extinct mosasaurs, which reached lengths of .

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. I am facing a new situation today: Carrie bought two parcels of farmland. The Northern one had soil with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the Southern parcel had almost no traces of AM fungi. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which parcel had a higher soil nutrient content? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, we can infer that the Southern parcel has higher soil nutrient content. This is because arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are known to be less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. This occurs as plants tend to allocate less carbon to AM fungi in nutrient-rich conditions and the fungi, in response, redirect their resources to intraradical hyphae. In the new situation, the Northern parcel has a higher concentration of AM fungi, which suggests that the soil nutrient content may be lower on this parcel compared to the Southern parcel. Conversely, the Southern parcel had almost no traces of AM fungi, implying its soil is likely richer in nutrients. It's also important to note that long-term environmental conditions can lead to local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi, and soil nutrient concentrations, further supporting the connection between lower AM fungi prevalence and higher soil nutrient content in the Southern parcel. Therefore, the correct answer is that the Southern parcel had a higher soil nutrient content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Objective: To make a dust collector for when using sanding disk attached to a lathe. Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Select from the following. A). Attach a vacuum hose underneath a hole in the work space. B). Attach a dust bin underneath a hole in the work space.","completion":"To determine the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning, let's analyze both options step by step and assess their effectiveness in collecting dust when using a sanding disk attached to a lathe. Option A: Attach a vacuum hose underneath a hole in the workspace. 1. The vacuum hose creates suction which would pull the dust particles from the air when using the sanding disk. 2. The airflow generated by the vacuum would help in collecting the dust more effectively as it would cover a larger area around the hole. 3. The vacuum system would require a power source, but the constant suction would provide continuous dust collection. 4. Vacuum systems can be easily emptied and maintained to ensure efficiency. Option B: Attach a dust bin underneath a hole in the workspace. 1. The dust bin would rely on gravity to collect the dust particles falling through the hole in the workspace. 2. The effectiveness of this method would depend on the size and position of the hole relative to the sanding disk, as well as the size of the dust bin. 3. The dust particles that don't fall directly through the hole would remain in the air and potentially settle elsewhere in the workspace, requiring further cleaning efforts. 4. The dust bin would need to be emptied periodically, depending on its capacity. Based on the analysis of the two options, Option A (attaching a vacuum hose underneath a hole in the workspace) appears to be a more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. It provides continuous and efficient dust collection with less reliance on the positioning of the hole and less risk of dust settling elsewhere in the workspace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Parisian examples of European architecture date back more than a millennium; including the Romanesque church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (1014-1163); the early Gothic Architecture of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (1144), the Notre Dame Cathedral (1163-1345), the Flamboyant Gothic of Saint Chapelle (1239-1248), the Baroque churches of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627-1641) and Les Invalides (1670-1708). The 19th century produced the neoclassical church of La Madeleine (1808-1842); the Palais Garnier Opera House (1875); the neo-Byzantine Basilica of Sacré-Cœur (1875-1919), and the exuberant Belle Époque modernism of the Eiffel Tower (1889). Striking examples of 20th century architecture include the Centre Georges Pompidou by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (1977), and the Louvre Pyramid by I.M. Pei (1989).

His recognizable works, apart from the Louis Vuitton Foundation, include the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, USA. Gehry was chosen for this particular project due to his creativity and artistic vision. The Louis Vuitton Foundation from 2014, is a two-story structure made largely of 3,600 individually cut glass panels that form the building's twelve \\"sails\\", inspired by the glass grandeur of the Grand Palais and the structure of icebergs. The museum, which is situated in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, has become a magnet for art lovers and architecture enthusiasts alike, due to Gehry's innovative design. Similar to a sailboat among the trees, Gehry's building features a succession of translucent 'sails' that artfully incorporate design, engineering, and aesthetic beauty, demonstrating Gehry's ability to create compelling structures that challenge the architectural norms. Moreover, the design reflects the foundation's commitment to promoting and supporting contemporary and emerging artistic expressions in a city globally recognized for its art and culture.

Write some highlights for the following article: Misogyny is so deeply rooted in India's collective psychology that even the president's son -- in this case, Congress Parliament member Abhijit Mukherjee -- could entangle himself with a remark against women protesting gang rape. He called them \\"dented and painted women\\" who go to discos, have little connection with ground realities and are making candlelight vigils fashionable. After an enormous backlash, he apologized and retracted his comments, but many are not satisfied and want his resignation. Misogyny has long permeated our textbooks, our pedagogy and our parenting. In fact, it runs so deep that it reflects itself even in our linguistics. The Hindi phrase most commonly used to describe sexual violence or rape against women is \\"izzat lootna,\\" which means \\"to steal the honor of.\\" Another Hindi word used for rape, \\"balatkar\\" (or \\"bad act\\"), is considered so erudite and technical that it's barely ever used. (Its English equivalent would be \\"coitus\\" instead of \\"sex.\\") So, for the most part, we're stuck with \\"izzat lootna\\" -- and the necessary question: Why should a rapist be given so much credit? Rape is a criminal act of force and perverse subjugation. When a woman is raped, her most fundamental rights as a human being are violated. Yet, she is just as honorable as she ever was. Honor cannot be stolen. It can only be surrendered. Surely in the act of rape, it is the perpetrator, not the victim, who surrenders honor. The brave girl from Delhi died with her honor intact. Her rapists will live in ignominy. Unfortunately, in India rape is inextricably linked by men -- and women -- to shame: the ultimate desecration. Many victims are murdered by their rapists or choose to commit suicide. It is also not uncommon for the parents of rape victims to kill themselves. Thus, most victims don't speak up about what happened to them, lest their families be ostracized, lest they never find a husband or be shunned by their friends. About 10 months ago, I was offered a role of a young, urban woman who gets gang raped. The film explores how she chooses to deal with what happens to her. It is a very powerful script, and most of me wanted to accept the role immediately. But a gnawing part of me worried about how I'd be perceived by the general public were I to perform this role. Female sexuality in Hindi cinema is extremely fraught, especially because audiences seem unable to comprehend the distinction between what a role demands from an actor and that person's conduct offscreen. In the script the woman is attractive, confident and self aware; she'd had several consensual relationships with men and enjoyed her sexuality. Truth be told, her character is not far from me in real life. Still, in patriarchal, judgmental, misogynistic Indian society, these are labels most women are afraid to carry publicly. On top of this, the character gets raped. I was afraid to accept the role. Afraid of whether audiences and the media would think I was promiscuous, desecrated. Embarrassed at the prospect of saying I'm doing a film in which I get raped, lest aspersions be cast on my character. There lay, in my own mind, the seeds of the same misogyny that makes Mr. Mukherjee's remarks in the wake of the student's gang rape so deplorable. Seeds I had to uproot at once. I accepted the role. At the time I was offered the film, rape wasn't getting the sort of national attention it is getting right now. It was still a topic that made most people uncomfortable, a topic that women and men alike were not able to freely express their opinions on. That India's young public is today demanding so vocally the need to address the way we view sexuality and gender equality is empowering. People are sharing their own experiences of sexual violence on blogs and social media. Men and women are collaborating to seek legal reform, to challenge the societal perceptions they have been force-fed. We now understand that to remain silent bystanders of a crime is to collude with the criminal. It is clear to me that as actors, filmmakers, artists, journalists, activists -- people who use a medium that has the potential to reach so many minds -- it is our responsibility to educate and mobilize, while we entertain. For the last 10 months, as we have been rehearsing and shooting, the subject of rape has been my foremost preoccupation. Two points have struck me in particular: First, the director, who is also the scriptwriter, is male. His co-writer, the music composer, is also male. These two artists, Tarun Chopra and Daboo Malik, chose to champion a cause that almost always gets packaged as a women's issue. In India, sexual violence is perpetrated almost entirely by men. Rapists are male. Should men not feel responsible then to prevent the occurrence of this crime? Shouldn't men be disturbed that their mothers, sisters, wives and daughters constantly feel unsafe or feel they have to dress and behave in a particular way to avoid getting raped? Isn't it time men educated other men about consent? Secondly, and this point took me longer to acknowledge, women are as guilty as men for the mindset that breeds the crime. We kill our own infant daughters, we immolate our sons' wives if they bear female children, we disapprove of women who make an effort to be attractive -- and doubt their character. We still look at marriage as if it's the purpose for which we were born. But misogyny is no longer misogyny when expressed by a woman. It's self-loathing. And while it is easy -- and justified -- for women to point fingers at men for the chauvinism in our society, don't we owe it to ourselves to look within? Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name that Watts objected to?, using the article: Although Watts's plans for the memorial had envisaged names inscribed on the wall, in the event the memorial was designed to hold panels of hand-painted and glazed ceramic tiles. Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied. The subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87.

Q: Q: In atherosclerosis, thickening of an arterial wall due to this can restrict blood flow through the artery? A: A:","completion":"Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease characterized by the thickening of an arterial wall due to the accumulation of fatty deposits, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances. This buildup is collectively referred to as plaque. When plaque accumulates in the arterial walls, it can restrict blood flow through the artery, leading to decreased oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues and organs. The process of atherosclerosis begins with damage to the inner lining of the artery, called the endothelium. This damage can be caused by various factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, elevated blood sugar levels, and high cholesterol. In response to this damage, the body's immune system sends white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells, along with lipids like cholesterol, begin to accumulate at the site, leading to the formation of fatty streaks. Over time, the fatty streaks can develop into fibrous plaques as connective tissue and smooth muscle cells migrate and proliferate in the affected area. The plaques can harden due to calcium deposits, making the arterial walls less elastic and narrowing the lumen of the artery. As the plaque continues to grow, it may partially or completely obstruct blood flow, causing symptoms like chest pain (angina) and shortness of breath. In some cases, plaque can rupture, triggering the formation of a blood clot. This can lead to more severe consequences like a heart attack or stroke, depending on the location of the affected artery. In summary, atherosclerosis results in the thickening of arterial walls due to the accumulation of plaque, which can cause significant restriction of blood flow through the artery, negatively affecting the supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"After Esquival arrived, did the Spanish remain in Nueva Sevilla?\\" Answer: \\"Moved to Villa de la Vega\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: OPTIONS: [1]. no; [2]. yes;","completion":"Answer: [1]. no; Explanation: The paragraph explains that when Esquivel arrived in Jamaica, he set up a base at Nueva Sevilla. However, the place turned out to be unhealthy and full of mosquitoes, so the Spanish moved away and founded a new place called Villa de la Vega, which is now known as Spanish Town. So they did not remain in Nueva Sevilla.

Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he instead shoots the rifle from her hands, then uses the Trans-Siberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov across the border into Austria and then on to Britain. In his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs MI6 that the KGB's old policy of Smiert Spionam, meaning Death to Spies, has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safe-house and assumed to have been taken back to Moscow.

The first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States in the 20th century. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. The first major engagement occurred at Las Trencheras on June 27. There the Dominican rebels had dug trenches on two hills, one behind the other, blocking the road to Santiago. The field guns of Captain Chandler Campbell's 13th Company, along with a machine gun platoon, took position on a hill commanding the enemy trenches and opened fire. Under the cover of this fire, the Marine infantry charged the defenders' first line, covered until the last possible moment by the artillery barrage. The insurgents fled to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and ran again as the American field guns resumed shelling. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines, at a cost to themselves of one killed and four wounded, had overrun the enemy positions. They found no dead or weapons in the trenches but later discovered five rebel bodies in the nearby woods. This engagement set the pattern for most Marine contacts with hostile forces in the Dominican Republic. Against Marine superiority in artillery, machine guns, small-unit maneuver, and individual training and marksmanship, no Dominican force could hold its ground.

Please answer this question: Footvolley, a variation of football, originated in which country?","completion":"Footvolley, a unique and engaging sport that combines elements of both football (soccer) and beach volleyball, originated in Brazil during the 1960s. Rio de Janeiro, the iconic Brazilian city known for its stunning beaches, is widely considered the birthplace of footvolley. The sport was created to provide a new and different way to enjoy the beach, taking advantage of the country's cultural affinity for football and the natural environment of its beautiful beaches. The origins of footvolley are attributed to Octavio de Moraes, a native Brazilian and former professional football player. He, along with a group of friends, started playing the new game on the sandy beaches of Copacabana, Ipanema, and other coastal areas of Rio de Janeiro. The concept behind the sport was to create a fun, athletic beach activity that incorporated the skills and techniques of football without the rough physical contact. This combination of football and beach volleyball allowed players of varying levels of skill and athletic ability to compete together. Footvolley follows several basic rules and principles similar to those of beach volleyball. For example, the game is played on a sand court, measuring 18 meters long by 9 meters wide, with a net that is 2.2 meters high for men and 2 meters high for women. The sport is typically played with teams of two players each, although variations with larger teams exist. The objective of the game is to strike the ball, using only body parts other than the hands and arms, over the net and ground the ball within the opponent's court. The opponents, in turn, have a maximum of three touches to return the ball back over the net. One major distinction between footvolley and beach volleyball is that footvolley players are not allowed to use their hands or arms to touch the ball at any time, just like in football. Instead, players use their feet, head, chest, and other body parts to control and strike the ball. This creates an entertaining and challenging dynamic that showcases players' agility, dexterity, and skill. Since its inception in Brazil, footvolley has grown in popularity across the world. Countries with strong football traditions, like Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and many others, have embraced footvolley and contributed to its development. International competitions, such as the Footvolley World Championships, the European Footvolley League, and the Pro Footvolley Tour, are held frequently, allowing players from around the globe to showcase their skills and compete at a high level. In conclusion, footvolley is a fascinating sport that originated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, blending elements of football and beach volleyball. Emphasizing the importance of skill, coordination, and teamwork, footvolley has captured the attention and passion of sports enthusiasts worldwide, with competitions and events held regularly across the globe."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: Who causes Wade to be sent to solitary confinement?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Two sailors, Jim and Eric decide to buy boats. The boats they buy ave a decent amount of iron in the construction and will be exposed to water almost constantly. Jim decides to coat his boat in a protective seal that seals out water and air. Eric thinks this is unnecessary and does not buy the protective seal. Will iron left out in a dry area such as a desert, or iron left in a damp area like a rain forest corrode faster? Hint: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion. Answer:","completion":"Iron will corrode faster in a damp area like a rainforest compared to a dry area such as a desert. The corrosion process of iron, which leads to rust formation, depends on the presence of both moisture and oxygen. In the given hint, the two-step process of rust formation involves the initial oxidation of iron to iron(II) ions followed by further oxidation and reaction with water and oxygen gas to produce rust, a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide. In a dry area like a desert, the availability of moisture is very limited. The lack of moisture slows down the corrosion process as there is not enough water to facilitate the reaction between iron(II) ions and oxygen gas to form rust. This results in a slower rate of corrosion for the iron exposed to the desert conditions. On the other hand, a damp area like a rainforest has an abundance of moisture in the atmosphere. The high humidity levels provide ample water to facilitate the reaction between iron(II) ions and oxygen gas, thus accelerating the formation of rust and increasing the rate of corrosion. Considering Jim's decision to coat his boat in a protective seal, this will likely help prevent or slow down the corrosion process by creating a barrier that restricts the exposure of the iron to moisture and oxygen. In contrast, Eric's decision not to use a protective seal could lead to faster corrosion of his boat's iron components due to constant exposure to water. In conclusion, iron left in a damp area like a rainforest will corrode faster than iron left in a dry area like a desert, due to the abundance of moisture available to facilitate the rust formation process. Using protective coatings, like the one chosen by Jim, can help reduce or prevent corrosion in environments with constant exposure to water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Angelina Jolie didn't plagiarize 'Blood and Honey,' judge says\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Angelina Jolie didn't plagiarize 'Blood and Honey,' judge says Introduction In a recent verdict, a judge has dismissed the claims of plagiarism against Angelina Jolie, the writer and director of the 2011 war drama 'In the Land of Blood and Honey.' The accusation surfaced when an author claimed that Jolie's movie had striking similarities to his book. This decision brings relief to the Academy Award-winning actress and director, clearing her reputation in the film industry. Background on the Case The case began when James Braddock, a Croatian journalist and author, filed a lawsuit against Jolie and the production company GK Films in December 2011. Braddock claimed that 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' shared numerous plot elements and characters with his 2007 book 'The Soul Shattering,' a story centered around the Bosnian War. Braddock accused Jolie and GK Films of copyright infringement and sought compensation. Analysis of the Evidence During the trial, Braddock's legal team presented several similarities between the book and the movie; however, the defendants argued that both works only addressed common themes and shared a historical context. Moreover, they emphasized the creative differences that distinguished Jolie's work from Braddock's narrative. The defense highlighted that in a war-based storyline, common themes such as suffering, love, betrayal, and revenge are inevitable. Therefore, these shared elements could not be considered as an indication of plagiarism. Judge's Decision and Reasoning After a thorough examination of the evidence, the judge ruled in favor of Angelina Jolie and GK Films, stating that the alleged similarities were insufficient to prove that 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' was a direct copy of 'The Soul Shattering.' The judge found that while both works were set during the Bosnian War and depicted the complex relationships between characters, these narrative aspects stemmed from the common historical context rather than copyright infringement. The judge also noted that the characters and plot lines in Jolie's film differed significantly from those in Braddock's book, dismissing the argument that the movie was derived from his work. Future Implications of the Verdict This verdict protects the creative freedom of filmmakers and authors who explore historical events and similar themes in their works. It emphasizes the importance of considering the context in which stories are told and acknowledges that overlapping ideas or themes do not necessarily translate to plagiarism. The court's decision to dismiss the case sets a precedent that ensures artists can continue to create original works without the fear of baseless accusations. Conclusion The verdict in the plagiarism lawsuit against Angelina Jolie brings closure to this legal battle and further validates her creative integrity as a writer and director. As we witness the unfolding of similar cases in the future, the principles upheld in this case will remain relevant in protecting artists' rights and ensuring that the creative process remains a free and open space."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The school is widely believed to be Williams College, Webb's alma mater (in the opening sequence of the movie, Dustin Hoffman, playing Benjamin Braddock, is wearing a Williams College tie). Benjamin is seen arriving at LAX International Airport over the opening credits.The movie really begins at a party that same evening celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles. Benjamin is visibly uncomfortable at the party attended by his parents' friends. He remains aloof while his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. Benjamin escapes from each person who comes to congratulate him, exposing his seeming embarrassment at all the honors he had won at college. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the neglected wife of his father's law partner, asks Benjamin to drive her home, which he reluctantly does. We never learn Mrs. Robinson's first name (or, indeed, the first names of any of Benjamin's and Elaine's parents) during the course of the film (in the novel, we are told that the initial of Mrs. Robinson's first name is G).Arriving at her home, she pleads for Benjamin to come inside, saying that she doesn't like to enter a dark house alone. Once inside, she forces a drink on him, and later exposes herself to him offering to have an affair with him. This scene, known as the \\"Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me\\" scene, as said by Benjamin, is said to be one of the most iconic scenes in the film.

This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form. Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called seracs.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Step 2: Identify key elements - Instructions for cleaning burners - Gas and electric stove top burners - Turning off and cooling down the stove Step 3: Assess the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that the provided instructions can be applied to both electric eye and gas fired stove burner types. Step 4: Compare the hypothesis with the context The context explicitly mentions that the instructions apply to gas and electric stove top burners. It can be inferred that electric eye burners fall within the category of electric stovetops. Therefore, the hypothesis seems to be valid because the context implies that the instructions are applicable to both electric eye and gas fired stove burners.

Mix in the oil and vanilla. Combine the flour, salt, baking powder, and spices. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Fold in the carrots.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Baking a Yummy Carrot Cake: A Simple Guide for Little Chefs Hi there, little chefs! Today, we're going to learn how to make a super yummy carrot cake. Don't worry; it's really easy, and I'll help you every step of the way! Are you ready? Let's start! Step 1: Get the Oven and Pan Ready First thing we need to do is to make the oven nice and warm. Ask an adult to help you \\"preheat\\" the oven. This just means turning it on and letting it get hot before we put our cake inside. They will tell you the right temperature. While the oven is getting warm, let's get our baking pan ready. A baking pan is a special dish where we'll pour our cake mixture. You can ask an adult to help you get the right one. To make sure our cake doesn't stick, we need to put a little bit of butter or cooking spray on the pan. This helps our cake slide out easily when it's done. Step 2: Mixing the Wet Ingredients Now it's time to mix our wet ingredients. Wet ingredients are things like eggs, oil, and vanilla. First, we're going to \\"beat the eggs.\\" This just means mixing them up really well until they're all mixed together. Next, we'll add some sugar and mix it with the eggs. Keep mixing until it looks light and bubbly. This makes our cake sweet and yummy. After that, we'll pour in some oil and a bit of vanilla. The oil helps make our cake moist, and the vanilla gives it a nice flavor. Give it a good mix until everything is combined. Step 3: Mixing the Dry Ingredients Now let's mix our dry ingredients. Dry ingredients are things like flour, salt, baking powder, and spices. In another bowl, put the flour, salt, baking powder, and some yummy spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. These spices will make our cake taste even more delicious. Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients Guess what? It's time to put our wet and dry ingredients together. Slowly, we will pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix them well. Be gentle and make sure everything is mixed in nicely. Step 5: Add the Carrots Our cake wouldn't be a carrot cake without carrots, right? So, now we'll add some grated carrots to our mixture. Grated means the carrots are cut into tiny little pieces. You can ask an adult to help you with this part. Now, all we have to do is \\"fold\\" the carrots into our mixture. This means gently mixing the carrots, so they are evenly spread throughout the cake. Step 6: Bake the Cake Our cake mixture is ready! Pour the mixture into the baking pan we prepared earlier. Then, ask an adult to help you put the pan into the oven. They will also tell you how long to bake the cake. When the cake is baked, let it cool down, and then you can enjoy your delicious homemade carrot cake with your family and friends! Great job, little chefs! Now you know how to make a scrumptious carrot cake all by yourself. What other tasty treats will you bake next?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Development of the Vertebral Column and Thoracic cage Development of the vertebrae begins with the accumulation of mesenchyme cells from each sclerotome around the notochord. These cells differentiate into a hyaline cartilage model for each vertebra, which then grow and eventually ossify into bone through the process of endochondral ossification. As the developing vertebrae grow, the notochord largely disappears. However, small areas of notochord tissue persist between the adjacent vertebrae and this contributes to the formation of each intervertebral disc. The ribs and sternum also develop from mesenchyme. The ribs initially develop as part of the cartilage model for each vertebra, but in the thorax region, the rib portion separates from the vertebra by the eighth week. The cartilage model of the rib then ossifies, except for the anterior portion, which remains as the costal cartilage. The sternum initially forms as paired hyaline cartilage models on either side of the anterior midline, beginning during the fifth week of development. The cartilage models of the ribs become attached to the lateral sides of the developing sternum. Eventually, the two halves of the cartilaginous sternum fuse together along the midline and then ossify into bone. The manubrium and body of the sternum are converted into bone first, with the xiphoid process remaining as cartilage until late in life. Q: The accumulation of what cells begin the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage? A: Options are: 1). semiosis cells; 2). hindbrain cells; 3).

Write some highlights for the following article: Marc Albrighton has been released by Aston Villa with Premier League newcomers Leicester City his likeliest destination. The winger has been with Villa since he was nine but his contract expired this summer and, as Sportsmail revealed on May 9, the Championship winners are understood to be keen on bringing him to the King Power Stadium on a free transfer. Albrighton, the former England Under-21 international, would receive an improved wage at Leicester with Villa failing to offer fresh terms despite his positive end to the Premier League campaign. Moving on: Marc Albrighton (left) is set to leave Aston Villa for Leicester City after his contract wasn't renewed. Better terms: Albrighton could command a higher salary at Leicester, who have just been promoted to the Premier League. The 24-year-old was sent on loan to Wigan for a month last October, only making four appearances, but returned and was one of the brightest playerâ€™s under Paul Lambert during the survival run-in. Leicester need to strengthen in the wide areas with experienced Lloyd Dyer, 31, looking elsewhere when his contract expires next month. Albrighton matches the profile of players manager Nigel Pearson looks for given his youth, fitness, and level-headedness. He would compete for a starting berth with Anthony Knockaert and Riyad Mahrez. Leicester are also poised to bid for Sheffield United's teenage striker Diego de Girolamo. The 18-year-old is an Italy Under 19 international but was born in Chesterfield. Striker Nathan Delfouneso has also been deemed surplus to requirements by Vila boss Paul Lambert. Gone: Nathan Delfouneso (centre) has also left Aston Villa. Lambert said: 'We wish Marc the best in his future career and acknowledge the contribution he has made to the club over the past several years having graduated from our academy.' Delfouneso, another academy graduate who spent last season on loan at Coventry, departs after 50 appearances following his debut, aged 17, in the UEFA Cup tie against Icelandic side FH Hafnarfjorour in August 2008.

The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits his friend, actor George Raft, on a film set. He buys a house in Beverly Hills from opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in Scarsdale. As a representative for his associates Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from Los Angeles gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna's operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Bugsy that he stole 14,000, and is told he now answers to Cohen. After arguments about Virginia's trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and a variety of bullfighters and Siegel's reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy. On a trip to Nevada to visit a gambling joint, Bugsy comes up with the idea for a hotel and casino in the desert. He obtains 1 million in funding from lifelong friend Lansky and other New York mobsters, reminding them that in Nevada, gambling is legal. Virginia wants no part of it until Bugsy puts her in charge of accounting and begins construction of the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, but the budget soon soars to 6 million due to his extravagance. Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets completed, even selling his share of the casino. Bugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate Harry Greenberg.

Fruits are usually associated with having a sweet taste; however, not all fruits are sweet. Botanically, the term “fruit” is used for a ripened ovary. In most cases, flowers in which fertilization has taken place will develop into fruits, and flowers in which fertilization has not taken place will not. Some fruits develop from the ovary and are known as true fruits, whereas others develop from other parts of the female gametophyte and are known as accessory fruits. The fruit encloses the seeds and the developing embryo, thereby providing it with protection. Fruits are of many types, depending on their origin and texture. The sweet tissue of the blackberry, the red flesh of the tomato, the shell of the peanut, and the hull of corn (the tough, thin part that gets stuck in your teeth when you eat popcorn) are all fruits.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine. But I can use this background: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. What is an answer for this question: Whose device would make work easier, Archimedes or Ptolemy? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, Archimedes' device would be more likely to make work easier. As the great inventor of machines, Archimedes was known for creating devices that utilize the principles of mechanics to increase force, distance, or change direction, making work more efficient and easier to accomplish. In this situation, it is mentioned that Archimedes came up with a great machine, while Ptolemy's device was not a machine and he couldn't do much in such a limited time. Since Archimedes' device is a machine, it would follow the principles of mechanics and make work easier by altering the force, distance, or direction in which the force is applied. However, with Ptolemy's device not being a machine, it's less likely to provide the same kind of mechanical advantage that Archimedes' machine would. Therefore, Archimedes' device would more likely make work easier compared to Ptolemy's device."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne), a word processor, meets Marcy Franklin (Rosanna Arquette) in a local cafe in New York. They discuss their common interest in Henry Miller. Marcy leaves Paul her number and informs him that she lives with a sculptor named Kiki Bridges (Linda Fiorentino), who makes and sells plaster of Paris paperweights resembling cream cheese bagels. Later in the night, under the pretense of buying a paperweight, Paul visits Marcy, taking a cab to her apartment. On his way to visit Marcy, a 20 bill is blown out the window of the cab, leaving him with only some spare pocket change. The cab driver is furious that he cannot pay. This is the first in a long series of misadventures for Paul that turn hostile through no fault of his own. At the apartment Paul meets the sculptor Kiki and Marcy, and comes across a collection of photographs and medications which imply that Marcy is severely disfigured from burns on her legs and torso. As a result of this implication, and as a result of a strained conversation with Marcy, Paul abruptly slips out of the apartment. Paul then attempts to go home by subway, but the fare has increased at the stroke of midnight and he finds that his pocket change is no longer sufficient to purchase a token. He goes to a bar where Julie (Teri Garr), a waitress, becomes enamored with him. At the bar, Paul learns that there have been a string of burglaries in the neighborhood. The bar's owner, Tom Schorr (John Heard), offers to give Paul money to cover the subway fare, but cannot open the cash register. They exchange keys so Paul can go to Tom's place to fetch the cash register keys. On the way back from Tom's apartment, Paul is questioned by suspicious neighbors. Afterwards, Paul spots two actual burglars, Neil (Cheech Marin) and Pepe (Tommy Chong), with one of Kiki's sculptures.

Second question: I have currently finished my second year of engineering in India and I got a CGPA of 7.8 for 2 years. If I get a good GRE score, can I make it into Georgia Tech University? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Pick from: + no + yes","completion":"First, let's address each question separately and then discuss whether they are asking the same thing. Question 1: If I got 2As, 2A*s, 2Bs, and 2Cs in GCSE, is it good for a known university? I am very scared. Answer: Achieving 2As, 2A*s, 2Bs, and 2Cs in your GCSEs is a solid set of results and should be commended. Admission to a well-known university will generally depend on several factors, including your specific subject grades, the requirements of your chosen course, and the competitiveness of the university you're applying to. In addition to your academic performance, universities will often consider other elements, such as extracurricular activities, personal statements, and letters of recommendation. To determine if your GCSE results are suitable for a specific university, research the entry requirements for your desired course and assess your own qualifications accordingly. If you find that you may not meet the necessary requirements, don't be discouraged – there are many universities with varied entry criteria that you may be better suited for. It's important to remember that academic success is not solely defined by the prestige of the university you attend. Question 2: I have currently finished my second year of engineering in India and I got a CGPA of 7.8 for 2 years. If I get a good GRE score, can I make it into Georgia Tech University? Answer: A CGPA of 7.8 out of 10 is a respectable score, indicating a good academic performance. Getting into Georgia Tech University's engineering program will depend on a combination of factors, including your CGPA, GRE scores, research experience, extracurricular activities, and letters of recommendation. The university's graduate engineering programs are highly competitive, so it's essential to have a well-rounded application to increase your chances of acceptance. In addition to your CGPA and GRE score, having a strong personal statement that highlights your goals and interests within the engineering field can be advantageous. Demonstrating relevant work or research experience, as well as showcasing your commitment to the field through extracurricular activities, will give you a competitive edge in the admission process. Given that the requirements for graduate programs at Georgia Tech University are stringent and competitive, it may be helpful to apply to several graduate schools, including those that have less demanding entrance qualifications. This approach will ensure that you have multiple options from which to choose. Regarding the question of whether these two queries are asking the same thing: No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question pertains to GCSE results and their suitability for entry into well-known universities, whereas the second question concerns a student's chances of being accepted into Georgia Tech University based on their CGPA and GRE performance. The two questions are similar in that they both inquire about the adequacy of academic achievements for specific institutions or levels of recognition, but the details and contexts of the questions are distinct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana. - Trieste is a city and seaport in northeastern Italy. It is situated towards the end of a narrow strip of Italian territory lying between the Adriatic Sea and Slovenia, which lies almost immediately south and east of the city. It is also located near Croatia some further south. Trieste is located at the head of the Gulf of Trieste and throughout history it has been influenced by its location at the crossroads of Latin, Slavic, and Germanic cultures. In 2009, it had a population of about 205,000 and it is the capital of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the Province of Trieste. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Winnetou is a fictional Native American hero of several novels written in German by Karl May (18421912), one of the best-selling German writers of all time with about 200 million copies worldwide, including the \\"Winnetou\\"-trilogy. - Friuli-Venezia Giulia is one of the 20 regions of Italy, and one of five autonomous regions with special statute. The capital is Trieste. (Note that Venezia, i.e. Venice, is \\"not\\" in this region, despite the name.) It has an area of 7,858 km² and about 1.2 million inhabitants. A natural opening to the sea for many Central European countries, the region is traversed by the major transport routes between the east and west of southern Europe. It encompasses the historical-geographical region of Friuli and a small portion of the historical region of Venezia Giulia (known in English also as Julian March), each with its own distinct history, traditions and identity. The name of the region was spelled FriuliVenezia Giulia until 2001, when, in connection with a modification of article nr. 116 of the Italian constitution, the official spelling \\"Friuli Venezia Giulia\\" was adopted. - Friuli is an area of Northeast Italy with its own particular cultural and historical identity. It comprises the major part of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia, i.e. the administrative provinces of Udine, Pordenone, and Gorizia, excluding Trieste. - Emona or Aemona (short for ) was a Roman castrum, settled by colonists from the northern part of Roman Italy. Emona itself was the region's easternmost city, although it was assumed formerly that it was part of the Pannonia or Illyricum, but archaeological findings from 2008 proved otherwise. It was located in the area where the navigable Ljubljanica came closest to Castle Hill. The river played an important role as a transport route for the trade between the city and the rest of Roman empire. From the late 4th to the late 6th century, Emona was the seat of a bishopric that had intensive contacts with the ecclesiastical circle of Milan, reflected in the architecture of the early Christian complex along Erjavec Street in present-day Ljubljana. - The Gulf of Trieste (, ) is a very shallow bay of the Adriatic Sea, in the extreme northern part of the Adriatic Sea. It is part of the Gulf of Venice and is shared by Italy, Slovenia and Croatia. It is closed to the south by the peninsula of Istria, the largest peninsula in the Adriatic Sea, shared between Croatia and Slovenia.

Question: What kind of animal is telling a story to her children? Movie plot title: The Gruffalo Movie plot: The protagonist of The Gruffalo is a mouse. The story of the mouse's walk through the woods unfolds in two phases; in both, the mouse uses cunning to evade danger.The mouse goes for a walk in the forest and on his way encounters several dangerous animals (a fox, an owl, and a snake). Each of these animals, clearly intent on eating the mouse, invites him back to their home for a meal. The cunning mouse declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he is going to dine with his friend, a gruffalo, whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal. The mouse describes the outlandish features of the gruffalo's monstrous anatomy. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat them, each animal flees. The mouse gloats to himself; he knows the gruffalo is a fictional monster:Silly old fox/owl/snake, doesn't he know? there's no such thing as a gruffalo!After he has seen off the last animal, however, the mouse is shocked to encounter a real gruffalo, bearlike and hideous and with all the frightening features the mouse thought that he was inventing. True to his reputation, the gruffalo threatens to eat the mouse, but again the mouse is cunning. He tells the gruffalo that he, the mouse, is the scariest animal in the forest. Laughing, the gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse as he demonstrates how everyone is afraid of him. The two walk through the forest, encountering in turn the animals that had earlier menaced the mouse. Each is terrified by the sight of the pair and runs off, and each time the gruffalo becomes more impressed with the mouse's apparent toughness. Exploiting this, the mouse threatens to eat the gruffalo, who himself flees.The story is based on a traditional Chinese folk tale of a fox that borrows the terror of a tiger.

Sentence from a movie review: it 's not particularly well made Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review, \\"it's not particularly well made,\\" we must conclude that the movie was perceived negatively by the reviewer. The phrase \\"not particularly well made\\" suggests that the reviewer found issues with various aspects of the movie which could be related to its technical execution, such as cinematography, sound design, or editing. Alternatively, it could be critiquing elements related to the story, acting, or direction. Though the specific aspect of the movie that was seen as poorly crafted is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, the overall sentiment is clearly negative. In a movie review, when a critic comments on a film's quality, they usually assess a variety of factors that contribute to the effectiveness of the movie as a whole. These factors can include the storyline, characters, acting, visual effects, and other production elements. A well-rounded review may point out strengths and weaknesses of each parameter to give a comprehensive analysis of the film's effectiveness as entertainment or as a piece of art. That being said, it's important to recognize that this is only a single sentence within a whole movie review, and it's possible that the reviewer has other positive or mixed feelings about the film that aren't captured in this one statement. Nonetheless, the specific sentence provided is undeniably negative and suggests that some aspects of the film were less than impressive. Ideally, to get a full understanding of the reviewer's perspective on the film, it would be necessary to read the entire review and consider how each part of their assessment collectively shapes their overall view of the movie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, we have a math problem that looks like this: 1197 * o = 1179 * o + 90, and we need to find the value of o. Let's think of o as a bunch of oranges. First, we want to get all the oranges (o) on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 1179 * o from both sides. This will get rid of the 1179 * o on the right side. 1197 * o - 1179 * o = 1179 * o + 90 - 1179 * o Now, we see that 1179 * o goes away on the right side: 18 * o = 90 Now, imagine that we have 18 bags with the same number of oranges in each bag, and together they hold 90 oranges. We want to know how many oranges are in each bag. To find this out, we can divide 90 by 18. 90 ÷ 18 = 5 So, there are 5 oranges in each bag, which means o = 5.

Write some highlights for the following article: With courses on David Beckham, Harry Potter and politicising Beyoncé on offer at prestigious universities, it comes as no surprise that students are now able to learn the art of the perfect 'selfie'. Budding photographers will be taught valuable life skills to prepare them to face an expectant world which could present a photo opportunity at any point as part of a new City Lit course in London. As well as offering guidance on the most flattering angles and lighting, the course - officially called 'The art of self portraiture' – promises to 'improve your critical understanding' of the 'selfie'. The 'selfie' trend went viral after Ellen DeGeneres' star-stuffed Oscar photo (pictured) and now City Lit college in London is offering a course in taking the perfect self-portrait. The path to the perfect profile picture will cost you just £132 (£106 for seniors) – but potential students should be warned that it does not come with a free 'selfie' stick. It is open to all, including those who have only 'engaged in self-portrait –even in the most casual way'. But the 'selfie' enthusiasts must be prepared to share their snaps, as organisers said a critique of students' work would form an important role in the learning process. Over four sessions, students will be taught to 'use light and significant detail' in their work and 'explain ideas of space, place and surrounding issues'. Kim Kardashian is one of the most prolific 'selfie' takers, even inspiring a new trend called the 'belfie' - or 'bum selfie' (right) Even David Cameron and Barack Obama got involved, but their selfie during Nelson Mandela's memorial service with Denmark's prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, caused controversy. There will be a brief exploration into the notions of 'identity, self-hood and memory' as well as the opportunity to 'develop new ideas to make your photography more relevant to your aims'. It is ideal for those who have an understanding of ISO, aperture, shutter speed, white balance and how to change these on your digital SLR or bridge camera. The 'selfie' phenomenon is so widespread that it was only a matter of time before courses started offering guidance on the most flattering angles and lighting. Twitter declared 2014 as the year of the 'selfie' after Ellen DeGeneres' star-stuffed Oscar photo was retweeted more than three million times - a Twitter record. The trend became so popular that it even inspired a song, '#SELFIE' by The Chainsmokers, which racked up 267 million views on YouTube. Models Millie Mackintosh (left) and Kendall Jenner (right) have both perfected the bikini 'selfie' Tennis players Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic take selfies during the BNP Paribas Showdown at Madison Square Garden.","completion":"City Lit, a prestigious college in London, is offering a new course that teaches budding photographers and selfie enthusiasts the art of taking the perfect selfie.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: From what movie was the song that the band who played Townsend's solo material live used as an intro at concerts in 2003 and 2004?, using the article: Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

She left the Democratic Party and in 2008, ran as the Presidential candidate of the Green Party of the United States. Context: On June 30, 2009, McKinney was aboard the Greek-flagged Free Gaza Movement's ship Spirit of Humanity carrying 21 activists including Irish peace activist Mairead McGuire, medical supplies, a symbolic bag of cement, olive trees and toys, when it was seized by the Israeli Navy 18 mi (29 km) off the Gaza coast. It is unclear whether they were in international waters or in Gazan waters, which is subject to the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Although both the Cypriot and Israeli authorities were officially informed the destination was Gaza before the vessel's departure, according to the Cypriot government the ship \\"was given permission by the competent Authorities of the Republic of Cyprus to sail off the port of Larnaca in Cyprus on the basis of its declaration that its intended destination was the port of Port Said in Egypt.\\" McKinney was held at the Givon immigration detention center in Ramle, until she was released on July 5. McKinney initially refused to sign the deportation papers because they were written in Hebrew and that the papers would require them to admit that they were in violation of Israel's blockade, which they deny. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Israeli officials stated that the \\"Palestinian Authority and the rest of the international community had agreed to the off-shore blockade to prevent arms smuggling into Gaza.\\" The Palestinian Chronicle reports that such an agreement to the off-shore blockade never happened. \\"No Palestinians have agreed nor did the international community agree to a blockade of Gaza by land or Sea.\\" On June 17, 2009, a group of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) called for an end to Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip.

In Turkey, after a military coup attempt took place, the relationship between the country and the European Union faced severe challenges, leading to a temporary suspension of their ties. The coup, which aimed to overthrow the government, caused tensions not only within the country but also in its international relations, particularly with the European Union. As a result, the relations between Turkey and the EU were strained and suspended for a certain period. Despite these challenging times, Turkey managed to continue its path towards democracy and held democratic elections three years after the coup incident. In these elections, the citizens voiced their opinions, and a new government was formed based on the will of the people. The electoral process was conducted following democratic principles and international standards. This crucial step taken by Turkey signaled its commitment to upholding democratic values and governance, ultimately contributing to the betterment of its relations with the EU. Recognizing Turkey's efforts and the successful conduct of democratic elections, the European Union decided to re-establish its relations with the country. Both sides understood the importance of maintaining strong ties and cooperation over various sectors, including economy, politics, security, and culture. The re-establishment of their relationship marked the beginning of a new chapter that aimed to overcome previous challenges and worked towards fostering constructive dialogue and collaborative actions for the mutual benefits of Turkey and the EU. Not only did the re-established bond contribute to the regional stability, but it also paved the way for exploring possible opportunities in fields like research, education, and technology, among others. Additionally, issues such as migration, counter-terrorism, and climate change became more manageable through closer coordination and cooperation between the two entities.

The practical approach, coupled with a record number of students graduating from college, is expected to strengthen competition in the job market, analysts said. More than 76 percent of university students said they wanted to work after earning their degrees this summer, up from 68.5 percent in 2012 and 73.6 percent last year, according to poll results from Zhaopin.com, a major online agency, Zhu Bo. The annual survey also shows that about 20 percent university graduates chose to further education after graduation, while about 3 percent wanted to start their own businesses.

When these things build up in damaging levels in the liver, the body may react with reactive inflammation that leads to hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. However, excessive alcohol use is not sufficient to promote alcoholic liver disease. Only 1 in 5 heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis, and 1 in 4 develops cirrhosis. Men are considered \\"heavy drinkers\\" if they have 15 or more drinks in a given week. Women are considered \\"heavy\\" drinkers with 8 or more drinks per week. You can still develop cirrhosis after you've stopped drinking. However, alcohol abstinence is still recommended for all people with cirrhosis. It will help treatment and healing, no matter what stage of the disease you're in. While cirrhosis is more common in men, cirrhosis in women is more likely to result from alcoholism. The chronic liver inflammation and injury from either virus can, over several decades, develop into cirrhosis. Risk factors for hepatitis B include unprotected sex, blood transfusions, and injection drug use with contaminated needles. This is a lot less prevalent in the US and other developed countries due to vaccinations. Risk factors for hepatitis C include infections from injection drug use, blood transfusions, and body piercing and tattoos. Cirrhosis from hepatitis C is the most common reason for liver transplants. In 15-30% of people with cirrhosis, diabetes is a risk factor for developing \\"non-alcoholic steatohepatitis\\" (NASH). Diabetes is also common in chronic hepatitis C infections — a common cause of cirrhosis — likely because of decreased pancreas function. Another cirrhosis cause that's often correlated with diabetes is hemochromatosis. This condition is characterized by iron deposits in the skin, heart, joints, and pancreas. The pancreatic buildup leads to diabetes. Obesity presents a wide variety of health concerns, from type 2 diabetes and heart disease to arthritis and stroke. But, the excess fat in the liver causes inflammation and damage that could develop into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. To determine whether you are within a healthy weight range, take advantage of an online BMI (body mass index) calculator. A BMI calculation takes into consideration your age, height, gender, and weight. If you have an autoimmune disease like inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or thyroid disease, be cautious. While they don't directly contribute to cirrhosis, they increase the risk of complications in other disorders that do lead to it. Heart disease is a risk factor for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis leading to cirrhosis. Furthermore, heart disease related to right-sided heart failure can cause liver congestion (nutmeg liver) and cardiac cirrhosis. Certain types of liver disease that cause cirrhosis have a pattern of genetic inheritance. Look at your family's medical history for diseases that put you at an increased risk for cirrhosis: Hereditary hemosiderosis Wilson's disease Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency What is a summary?","completion":"Alcohol can damage the liver by hindering its ability to process carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, potentially leading to conditions such as hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. However, not all heavy drinkers develop these issues. Cirrhosis risks are influenced by factors like hepatitis B and C, diabetes, hemochromatosis, obesity, autoimmune diseases, and heart disease. Some liver diseases that cause cirrhosis have genetic components, such as hereditary hemosiderosis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Individuals should be aware of their risk factors, maintain a healthy weight, and consider abstaining from alcohol to reduce the likelihood of developing cirrhosis and related conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This science fiction novel is one of Verne's most famous works and played a significant role in establishing him as a leading author in the genre. The book tells the story of Professor Otto Lidenbrock, his nephew Axel, and their Icelandic guide Hans Belker, as they embark on a daring and dangerous adventure deep into the Earth's core. Inspired by a runic manuscript that reveals a subterranean passage leading to the Earth's center, the trio encounters many fantastical places and prehistoric creatures along their expedition. The novel is known for its thrilling narrative, scientific accuracy (for its time), and rich imagination. \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is considered an early work of science fiction, and it has left a lasting impact on the genre. The book has been adapted into several films, television shows, and stage plays over the years, further cementing its status as a timeless classic.

Firstly, tennis is indeed an outdoor game. So, the \\"Outdoor games player\\" could possibly refer to the tennis player mentioned earlier. The sentence also mentions that the player is looking serious, which aligns with the fact that the tennis player makes a serious face. However, we need to be cautious about jumping to conclusions. The sentence \\"Outdoor games player is looking serious\\" is vague and can refer to any outdoor game, not exclusively to tennis players. In addition, it is not explicitly mentioned that the player who is looking serious is the same tennis player who hits the ball. Therefore, the most appropriate answer in this case is: (b). it is not possible to tell The reason for this choice is that we cannot be certain that the outdoor games player looking serious and the tennis player hitting the ball are the same person just based on the given information.

Most disruptive kid behavior is attention-seeking, so your most powerful response is to withdraw your attention completely by ignoring. Is your kid whining non-stop because you turned off the TV? Let her know you’ll be tuning her out. You might say, “Hey Suzie, right now you are whining, and that hurts my ears. I’m not going to answer you until you can use your regular voice.” Then, don’t give her any response or feedback (that means, no eye contact, no “mom eye,” and no verbal feedback to her behavior. The moment she does something appropriate, praise! (i.e. “Thank you so much for asking in your big girl voice.”) Nobody with kids has time to read the whole Internet. Sign up here forTime for Parents, a weekly newsletter with only the worthwhile stuff. Praise the positive opposite. Do you hate when your child screams inside? Amp up the praise for those moments when you catch her using her inside voice. Hate poor table manners? Look for any opportunity to praise proper use of utensils or chewing with mouth closed. Your child will learn that he gets your attention by behaving well, and you’ll start to see that negative behavior decrease. Give specific commands. “Calm down” can be hard for a kid to decipher. Try, “Please put your hands in your lap” or “sit in your seat.” This way, your child and you are very clear on what is being asked. Tell your child what TO do rather than what NOT to do. A command to “stop running” might back fire if your child then chooses to skip or gallop down the aisle at Target. Instead, try “please walk next to me.” This gives the child a specific expectation and there is no guesswork for you on whether or not she is choosing to comply. Label problem behaviors. If your child likes to kick, pinch, push, and throw toys when he gets upset, you might label all these behaviors as “rough,” and let him know that anytime he’s rough, there will be a set consequence. Pick a neutral time (i.e. when he’s not in trouble), and try saying something like this: “Hey Johnny, usually you do a really good job being gentle with your hands. But sometimes, you forget and you are really rough. You are rough when you pinch, push, kick, or throw toys. From now on, anytime you’re rough, you’re going to have to sit in time-out. I know you’ll do your best to remember to be gentle so you can keep playing and having fun.” Don’t forget to label the behaviors in the moment—i.e. “Johnny, you just pushed your sister. That’s being rough. Because you’re rough, you’re going to have to have a timeout.” Practice attunement. The best way to decrease problem behaviors is to increase your connection and positive interactions with her. Try saving 5-10 minutes every day to get down and really play with her. Let her lead the play, and you just following along. Praise her for what she is doing well. These types of interactions will help her feel heard and seen by you, and make her less likely to demand her attention in negative ways throughout the day.

Article: Aromatherapy is generally delivered through essential oils, which are distilled from the leaves, stems, flowers, bark, or roots of specific plants. There are a wide variety of essential oils that can help you relax. Choose one with an appealing scent to you or mix several for a personalized essential oil. Some of the best essential oils for relaxation are: Bergamot Chamomile Jasmine Lavender Marjoram Rose Valerian Vetiver Every essential oil has different properties. Some may not be ideal for helping you relax. Reading the label of any essential oil you choose can alert you to potential contra-indications and prevent potential problems. Find contra-indications and any other warnings by reading the label of the essential oil. For example, you should see a warning about using valerian if you are pregnant or breast feeding. If there is no label, consider another brand. Essential oils are very powerful and you should avoid using a “neat” or undiluted oil on your skin. A carrier oil reduces the potency of an essential oil. It also moisturizes your skin. Use a mild carrier oil. Some excellent options are coconut, olive, avocado, safflower, and almond oils. Mix seven to12 drops of essential oil to each fluid ounce of carrier oil, depending on how strong you want the aroma. Don’t dilute your essential oil with water or other liquids. These won’t make the mixture mild enough to use on your skin. Before using your essential oil, it’s important to check that the mixture doesn’t irritate your skin. Dab one to two drops of the oil on the inside of your elbow. If you don’t notice a reaction after 24 hours, you can use the essential oil to help you relax. What is a summary?","completion":"Aromatherapy typically operates through the application of essential oils, which are extracted from various parts of plants, like leaves, flowers, bark, or roots. Certain types of essential oils are particularly known for their relaxing properties, such as Bergamot, Chamomile, Jasmine, Lavender, Marjoram, Rose, Valerian, and Vetiver. However, not all essential oils suit everyone, and it's essential to read the product label to avoid potential contraindications and adverse effects. For instance, there should be a warning against using Valerian oil for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Oils that lack a warning label should be avoided. Essential oils are highly potent, so it's important to dilute them with a carrier oil, like coconut, olive, avocado, safflower, or almond oil, instead of using them in their \\"neat\\" or concentrated form. These carrier oils can fundamentally lessen the strength of the essential oils while also providing skin moisturization benefits. The recommended ratio for dilution is seven to twelve drops of essential oil per fluid ounce of carrier oil, depending on the desired aroma strength. It's crucial not to dilute essential oils with water or other liquids as these don't sufficiently tone down the harshness of the oil for skin application. Lastly, always patch test the oil on a small part of the skin, such as the inner elbow, and wait for 24 hours to ensure there's no adverse reaction before using the oil for relaxation purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Knowing that \\"the moon 's surface contains highlands\\", how would one answer \\"The moon has\\"","completion":"The moon has a diverse, interesting, and complex surface that is characterized by various topographical features. The presence of highlands on the moon is one of the distinctive aspects of its surface, which contributes significantly to its geology. In order to better understand the composition and history of the moon, as well as offering a detailed response to the phrase \\"The moon has,\\" one must consider several key factors that revolve around lunar highlands. 1. Formation: The lunar highlands are thought to have formed early in the history of the moon, around 4.5 billion years ago. They are primarily composed of a light-colored, coarse-grained rock called anorthosite, which is rich in calcium and aluminum. This material likely originated from the solidification of a global magma ocean that once covered the moon's surface, and these solidified components floated to the surface to create the highlands. 2. Features: The moon's surface exhibits a range of topographical features, including craters, plains, and mountains. However, the highlands differ significantly from the maria, or large basins filled with basalt, which appear darker on the moon's surface. The highlands are characterized by their lighter appearance, which results primarily from their higher albedo, or reflectivity, and elevated altitudes. Additionally, the highlands exhibit more cratering, which is indicative of their older age and exposure to meteoroid impacts throughout the moon's geological history. 3. Significance in lunar exploration: The lunar highlands have been a key area of interest for both manned and unmanned lunar exploration missions. Apollo astronauts collected samples of anorthosite during the Apollo 16 mission, which helped reveal the composition and formation of the highlands. These samples have been vital in understanding the geological history of the moon, and they hold valuable information about the early history of our solar system. 4. Future exploration: The diverse and complex nature of the lunar highlands makes them an attractive target for future exploration by both human-crewed and robotic missions. In recent years, attention has been focused on the potential presence of water ice and other volatiles at the moon's poles, with highlands near these regions thought to be more accessible reserves for these resources. Water ice is not only important for life support systems for future lunar settlements, but also for the production of rocket fuel, which could potentially support space travel beyond the moon. 5. Scientific importance: The highlands also hold vast scientific potential for researchers studying lunar geology, planetary formation, and other related fields. By better understanding the composition and evolution of the moon's highlands, scientists can gain a deeper appreciation of our own planet's history, as well as that of other terrestrial bodies throughout the solar system. In summary, the phrase, \\"The moon has,\\" should be expanded to convey that the moon has a unique surface characterized not only by highlands but also craters, plains, and maria. These highlands are of great interest due to their formation, striking visual features, and potential for future exploration and resource utilization. Additionally, our understanding of the highlands provides vital information about the broader context of lunar geology and the early history of the solar system."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: \\"Red\\" Grange was born on June 13, 1903, in Forksville, Pennsylvania, a village of about 200 people in an area of lumber camps. His father was the foreman of three lumber camps. His mother died when he was just five years old. For a number of years, the Grange family lived with relatives until they could finally afford a home of their own in Wheaton, Illinois. To commemorate college football's 100th anniversary in 1969, the Football Writers Association of America chose an all-time All-America team. Grange was the only unanimous choice. Then in 1999, he was ranked number 80 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. In 2008, Grange was also ranked #1 on ESPN's Top 25 Players In College Football History list. In honor of his achievements at the University of Illinois, the school erected a 12-ft statue of Grange at the start of the 2009 football season. In 2011, Grange was announced as number one on the \\"Big Ten Icons\\" series presented by the Big Ten Network. In 1931, Grange visited Abington Senior High School in Abington, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. Shortly thereafter, the school adopted his nickname for the mascot in his honor, the Galloping Ghost. Also, Wheaton Warrenville South High School's football field is named in his honor and the team is referred to as the Wheaton Warrenville South Red Grange Tigers. Annually, the Wheaton Warrenville South Boys Track and Field team hosts the Red Grange Invitational in honor of Grange's achievements in track and field. On January 15, 1978, at Super Bowl XII, Grange became the first person other than the game referee to toss the coin at a Super Bowl. Every December, a junior college bowl game is held in his honor known as the Red Grange bowl, in his home state of Illinois. In 2017, Mesabi Range College was defeated by the College of Dupage in the 2nd edition of this bowl. What happened as a result?","completion":"As a result of \\"Red\\" Grange's accomplishments and impact on football, various honors were bestowed upon him.

Answer based on context: San Juan County has not supported a Democrat for president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. However the county is slightly more competitive at the state level due to its high Native American population, who lean Democrat, and the comparatively small Mormon population which leans Republican, as well its economic distress. Notably, San Juan voted for the Democratic candidates in the 1988 and 2000 gubernatorial elections, both of which Republicans won. The area also votes less Republican than the rest of Utah in national elections. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush won 60.02% in San Juan County versus 71.54% in the state as a whole.Federally mandated commissioner districts put many Navajo voters in one district. The San Juan County Board of Commissioners has been majority white for many years. In 2016, a Federal District Court decision found voting districts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. The County was afraid to redraw district boundaries because they were put in place by a Federal Judge. Before this the County used an at large voting system to elect commissioners How many percentage points difference did George W. Bush win in Utah versus how many he won in San Juan County?","completion":"Okay, little buddy! George W. Bush won 60.02% in San Juan County and 71.54% in the whole state of Utah. To find out the difference in percentage points, we'll subtract the smaller number from the bigger one. So, 71.54% minus 60.02% equals 11.52%. That means George W. Bush won 11.52 percentage points more in Utah compared to San Juan County."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Autumn had arrived and the leaves were falling quickly. Kai spent the afternoon raking leaves. Given the context: How would you describe Kai? Options: (1). dirty. (2). lazy. (3). responsible. The answer is:","completion":"(3). responsible. Kai can be described as responsible because he took the initiative to maintain the cleanliness and orderliness of his surroundings by raking leaves during the autumn season. Autumn is known for leaves falling quickly from the trees, which can lead to a messy environment that requires a constant upkeep to maintain its appearance and prevent any safety hazards due to wet or slippery leaves. A responsible person takes care of their environment, understands the consequences of not attending to necessary tasks, and invests time and effort into ensuring that their surroundings are well-kept. In spending the afternoon raking leaves, Kai demonstrated responsibility by taking on the task of keeping his outdoor area clean and safe. In comparison to the other options, \\"dirty\\" and \\"lazy\\" do not aptly describe Kai in this scenario: (1). Dirty - Although it is possible that Kai may have gotten dirty from raking leaves, the option does not focus on his personal cleanliness but rather on his actions. Based on his efforts to maintain the cleanliness of his surroundings, describing Kai merely as \\"dirty\\" would be an inaccurate and incomplete representation of his character in this context. (2). Lazy - Raking leaves can be a physically demanding and time-consuming task. Given that Kai dedicated his afternoon to this chore, it would not be accurate to label him as lazy. On the contrary, he demonstrated discipline and commitment to taking care of his environment, which are traits associated with a responsible person. In conclusion, the most fitting description for Kai in this context would be (3) responsible, as his actions of raking leaves and spending time to maintain the cleanliness and orderliness of his surroundings demonstrate his commitment towards fulfilling his duties and being accountable for his environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Why were they flustered ?","completion":"The individual in question was flustered for a variety of reasons during the speaking part of the interaction with the Russian lady. It is important to examine the context and possible factors leading to their emotional state in order to provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis. Below are some potential explanations as to why they might have felt flustered: 1. Unexpected Encounter: The person might not have anticipated being approached by someone and questioned. The surprise element of the interaction could have added to their flustered state, as they might not have had the time to mentally prepare themselves for such an encounter. 2. Language Barrier: The presence of a language barrier or the possession of limited proficiency in the Russian language might have contributed to their feeling of fluster. It can be challenging to hold a conversation in a foreign language, especially if one is not very comfortable or adept at using it. In this case, the person might have been struggling to understand the lady's questions and formulate coherent responses, resulting in their flustered demeanor. 3. Cultural Differences: The cultural backdrop of the individuals involved could also play a role in the emotional response. If the person is not familiar with Russian communication styles or social norms, it can lead to discomfort and fluster during the exchange. They may not have been sure how to behave or what was expected of them in the interaction. 4. Social Anxiety: The person may have been dealing with anxiety, particularly in social situations or when speaking with unfamiliar people. This can lead to nervousness, discomfort, and agitation, making it difficult to maintain a composed demeanor during the conversation. 5. Performance Pressure: The individual might have felt an immense amount of pressure to perform well in the conversation - whether it was to impress, prove their language abilities, or uphold their personal or professional reputation. The pressure to perform perfectly in any scenario can be overwhelming, leading to feelings of fluster and nervousness. 6. Context of the Conversation: The context in which the conversation took place could also have been a factor in the person's flustered state. If the surrounding environment was noisy, chaotic, or otherwise distracting, it could add to the difficulty of maintaining focus and confidence during the exchange. 7. Personal Factors: Finally, it is possible that the person might have been dealing with factors or events on a personal level that affected their emotional state during the interaction. Such factors could include stress, fatigue, or personal issues unrelated to the conversation but still influential in their overall demeanor. In conclusion, the individual felt flustered during the speaking part of the interaction with the Russian lady due to a combination of factors, such as the unexpected nature of the encounter, language barrier, cultural differences, social anxiety, performance pressure, the context of the conversation, and personal factors. It is essential to understand that each person's emotional response to a situation can be influenced by a wide array of elements, and it might not always be possible to pinpoint one specific cause for their flustered state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But Bulvitis, signed in the summer from Spartaks Jurmala, rose highest to meet Connor Smith's 32nd-minute corner and bag the Pilgrims all three points. Sonny Bradley came to Plymouth's rescue after 10 minutes when he cleared a Stead shot off the line before Matt Tootle's follow-up was blocked by Oscar Threlkeld. It was Argyle, through, who opened the scoring five minutes later when Gary Miller intercepted a wayward pass and found Jervis, who drilled a low shot into the bottom corner. Notts were behind for just three minutes as Stead broke free down the right, cut into the box, beat two players and fired an effort past Luke McCormick. Home debutant Louis Laing had a shot blocked and headed over, either side of Bradley slicing a clearance against his own woodwork. Sloppy defending from Notts, though, handed Argyle the initiative once more as Latvian international Bulvitus nodded in Smith's corner. Jonathan Forte flicked a header just wide early in the second half and Tootle nodded Alex Rodman's cross off target, while in a rare Plymouth attack, Graham Carey's shot was kept out by Adam Collin.

Premiering on NBC on September 14, 2009, the program aired on weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT through February 9, 2010. The program was modeled upon the format of a late night talk show--specifically, Jay Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show, opening with a comedic monologue, followed by interviews with celebrity guests and other comedy segments. Sketches from The Tonight Show (including Headlines and Jaywalking) were carried over to The Jay Leno Show, along with new sketches. In early January 2010, multiple media outlets reported that, following the 2010 Winter Olympics, The Jay Leno Show would be shortened to 30 minutes and begin airing weeknights at 11:35 pm ET, with Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon's shows following it beginning at 12:05 am on March 1, 2010. On January 10, NBC Universal Television Entertainment Chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that The Jay Leno Show would indeed move to 11:35. Leno immediately accepted the return to 11:35 p.m., calling the move \\"all business.\\" He had made it known in the press in November 2009 that he wished to return to his old timeslot; behind the scenes, Leno had privately indicated that he did not believe the 10:00 experiment would work. On the other hand, O'Brien's contract stipulated that the network could move the show back to 12:05 a.m. without penalty, a loophole put in primarily to accommodate sports preemptions, the network's traditional nightly Wimbledon tournament highlights show, and specials such as New Year's Eve with Carson Daly. O'Brien did not seriously respond for several days after the announcement, then drafted a press release explaining why he felt it was unfair to him, his staff, Fallon, and the legacy of The Tonight Show to move the show past midnight. He concluded by saying that he \\"cannot participate in what I honestly believe is [The Tonight Show's] destruction.\\" O'Brien received an outpouring of celebrity and viewer support for rejecting the move, while Leno received heavy criticism. On January 21, O'Brien signed a 45 million deal allowing him to leave the network, and aired his final episode of Tonight on January 22; Leno returned as host of Tonight on March 1.

Question: Whose speech is rejected by Peter Movie title: Forty-Ninth Parallel Movie plot: Early in the Second World War, U-37, a German U-boat, makes its way to Canadian waters and participates in fictional anti-shipping activities similar to those that would later characterize the Battle of the St. Lawrence (which occurred in actuality some time after the film's release). The U-boat succeeds in evading an RCAF patrol and moves north. While a raiding party of six Nazi sailors is put ashore in an attempt to obtain supplies, the U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay. The six attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the neutral United States. Led by Lieutenants Hirth (Eric Portman) and Kuhnecke (Raymond Lovell), the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalise a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick (Ley On), and a French-Canadian trapper (Laurence Olivier). Happening across a floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, the group steals the aircraft and begins flying across Canada. Outside Winnipeg they attempt to stir up the Hutterite community, believing them to be sympathetic to the German cause. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter (Anton Walbrook), the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel (Niall MacGinnis), who comes to the aid of Anna (Glynis Johns), a 16-year-old girl. Vogel, who would rather join the community and ply his trade of baker, is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his car, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee west. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed eleven civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz confronts writer Phillip Armstrong-Scott (Leslie Howard) in a cave and despite wounding him is knocked cold.

Despite the popular book series having concluded 10 years ago with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the books continue to capture the imaginations of more fans (with several gathering together just last week). After all, as recent Amazon Charts show, author J.K. Rowling’s books are among those that are consistently finished by their readers. So it’s no surprise that the 20th anniversary of the beginning of the beloved book series is being celebrated with much vigor. Twitter and Facebook have featured special emojis, hashtags, and special effects, while the New York Times crossword is Harry Potter-themed (though it doesn’t quite solve itself — some magic!). With so many readers looking back at the books and sharing why they loved them so much, EW presents, the most highlighted lines from all seven books (Sorcerer’s Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows) as well as the script for the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: 1. “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) 2. “After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.” (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone) 3. “Harry, there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.” (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child – Parts One and Two) 4. “To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.” (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone) 5. “Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.” (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone) 6. “Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.” (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone) 7. “There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.” (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone) 8. “Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels.

Twenty years ago on this day, the wizarding world of Harry Potter forever changed our lives. Written by J.K. Rowling, \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" (the first installment of the seven-book series) was published by Bloomsbury Publishing on June 26, 1997. For many of us, the Harry Potter books and their corresponding films are weirdly personal -- we sort of grew up alongside the characters. When Harry caught his first golden snitch, we remembered our first sporting event. When Hermione's hand shot up in the air to answer a question, we remembered those times we aced a test. To toast this special day, we at espnW have come up with the top five sporting moments from the \\"Harry Potter\\" franchise: 1. Harry's first Quidditch match: We all remember that first Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin in the \\"Philosopher's Stone.\\" From Hermione's nifty spellcasting to Harry's unorthodox method for catching his first golden snitch -- the snitch was lodged in his throat, and he had to regurgitate it -- this was by far the most dramatic Quidditch match of the whole series. Sidenote: That same snitch opens in \\"The Deathly Hallows\\" to reveal the resurrection stone -- the second Hallow -- which saves Harry's life. 2. Ron's game-changing chess victory: Ronald Weasley doesn't take charge in a fight very often. But he was all business when he stepped onto the life-sized Wizard's Chessboard and realized what needed to be done to get through to the Philosopher's Stone. When Ron sacrificed himself to ensure a victory, we all celebrated. How many of you stood up and clapped when Dumbledore awarded special points to Ron at the end of the year for his exemplary skills as a chess player? 3. Gryffindor winning the inter-house Quidditch Cup: It was incredibly satisfying to read that Gryffindor captain Oliver Wood and Harry took out Slytherin's team in \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" to win the cup -- after a seven-year drought. That moment Harry inched past a speeding Draco Malfoy on his Firebolt to grab the snitch was epic. 4. Harry crushing the Hungarian Horntail: \\"Goblet of Fire\\" is chock full of sporting moments. There's the Quidditch World Cup, the second task in the Hogwarts' lake and the infamous maze. When Harry flies his Firebolt and crushes a vicious dragon in the first task, we were filled with glee. Pretty sure every Potterhead dropped their book and pumped their fist in the air when we read that Harry scooped the golden egg from underneath the dragon's belly. Just admit it. 5. Felix Felicis and Ron's perfect Quidditch match: Okay, we all know Ron is bad at Quidditch. It's not Wizard's Chess, and his hand-eye coordination as a keeper was abysmal. But in the \\"Half-Blood Prince,\\" when Ron saw Harry slip what he thought was the lucky potion \\"Felix Felicis\\" into his pumpkin juice, he crushed the Slytherin team with his skills. These two events almost made it to our list: The duel between Harry and Draco Malfoy in \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" and The Quidditch World Cup final -- only because the lead-up included travel by Portkey, magical tents and Ludo Bagman, the comical Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports. ||||| On Harry Potter's 20th Anniversary, Listen To His NPR Debut Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images The first book of the Harry Potter series went on sale in the U.K. 20 years ago today. It offers a convenient excuse to reacquaint yourself with a world before anyone on this side of the Atlantic had heard of muggles, horcruxes or pensieves, before tourists would crowd into London's Kings Cross railway station simply to peer wistfully at the space between Platforms Nine and Ten. Here's the first story NPR ever aired about Harry Potter — a wonderful piece by the late Margot Adler, from All Things Considered in 1998. Some gems, from that bygone era: \\"Most people in the U.S. have never heard of Harry Potter. It's not a title you see in the window at your local Barnes & Noble.\\" Rowling's recollection of how Harry came to her while she stared out a train window at some cows. Margot Adler's uncannily accurate prediction that the word \\"muggle\\" will become a Whole Big Thing. A Q and A session in which a kid asks Rowling about her writing, and Rowling reads the Reptile House scene from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. A quote from a bookstore manager marveling at the fact that they've sold \\"hundreds\\" of copies. ||||| Upon learning that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone was known in its homeland by a different name, many young readers in the U.S. might’ve just chalked it up to another quirk between American and British English. (See entry for “jumper.”) But the real reason that Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, published 20 years ago Monday, took on more of a Mickey Mouse vibe across the pond had everything to do with marketing. Simply put, J.K. Rowling’s U.S. publisher didn’t think the first “Harry Potter” book sounded magical enough with her original U.K. title ― even though it references the stuff of actual legend. In his 2015 Rowling biography, Philip W. Errington documented how Arthur A. Levine, who helms the Scholastic imprint that publishes “Harry Potter,” suggested the change when adapting the story for U.S. fantasy lovers. “Levine noted that he needed a title that said ‘magic’ more overtly to American readers,” Errington writes. “He [Levine] continued, ‘I certainly did not mind Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone but I can see, if you forget now what happened after, ... why a book that is titled Philosopher’s Stone might seem more arcane or something. So the title that I had suggested to me and which I then turned to Jo was Harry Potter and the School of Magic. Jo very thoughtfully said, No ― that doesn’t feel right to me ... there are objects that I would like. What if we called it the Sorcerer’s Stone?’” And that was that. “Sorcerer’s stone” doesn’t have the same history behind it as the philosopher’s stone, which was thought by alchemists in centuries past to turn ordinary metals into precious ones and prolong the user’s life, but it is a bit more straightforward. Harry, A History author Melissa Anelli noted that Levine had thought the U.K. title might actually be misleading. “If you think about marketing a book, it is possible that someone hears ‘Philosopher’s Stone’ and thinks it’s a book about philosophy,” Levine told the author in 2006. We’d like to point out that British readers apparently did not have that problem, considering the book became a best-selling phenomenon in that country and quickly took over the world. But we’re still thankful for Levine ― without him, “Harry Potter” might’ve taken a little bit longer to reach our shores, and that would have been the real mistake. ||||| Monday marked the 20th anniversary of the publication of J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” and both Facebook and Google decided to add some magic to the day and celebrate Potter’s birthday in their own ways. Facebook surprised its users Monday with a neat trick: Adding “Harry Potter” or the names of any of the four houses of Hogwarts to any Facebook post, and then clicking on that name, automatically unlocked a magic wand that spewed flashing lights and smoke clouds all over one’s Facebook page. As a bonus, each house was automatically printed in the right color. Potter’s own name showed up in red, given that he’s a member of Gryffindor. Google went a bit of a different route for its Harry Potter birthday celebration, and decided to take fans of J.K. Rowling’s magic universe on a Google Earth tour to the places that inspired Rowling and the producers of the Harry Potter films, and now often have become places of pilgrimage for Potter fans. These include not only London’s King’s Cross station, but also the real-life castle that was used as Hogwarts in the first two films, the film set of the Hogwarts dining hall and more. ||||| Happy 20th birthday to “Harry Potter”! The series, that is. (To be clear, Harry Potter the character will turn 37 on July 31, his canonical birthday.) Monday is perhaps the least magical day to celebrate such an immensely joyful milestone, but don’t let the beginning of the work week prevent you Potterheads out there from enjoying the 20th anniversary. Here are 7 small ways to add a sparkle of “Harry Potter” magic to your day: 1. Do the NYT Crossword Puzzle! In honor of “Harry Potter”’s big day, The New York Times crosswords editor Will Shortz hosted a special Potter-themed puzzle by Brian Greer, one-time crosswords editor for The Times of London. Bonus: It’s the Monday puzzle, so even those of us who aren’t cryptogram experts might be able to complete it and find the hidden message without the help of Felix Felicis. 2. Tweet! Twitter J.K. Rowling and others have been sharing their feelings about the anniversary on Twitter using the hashtag #HarryPotter20. As a little gift to the Potter faithful, Twitter created an adorably appropriate emoji for the occasion, which pops up when users deploy the hashtag: Twitter Too perfect. Also, check out Pottermore’s Twitter profile and revel in the birthday balloon shower. 3. Facebook! If you’re more of a Facebooker, that social network has whipped up its own elaborate Easter egg for fans. Type “Harry Potter” or one of the four houses ― Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin ― into a status or comment, and a wand will pop up and shower multicolored sparks onto the screen. Facebook To see it again, just click on the word. Vermillious! 4. Whip up some Butterbeer. What better day to try to replicate that favorite wizarding brew, Butterbeer? There have been recipes floating around for the beverage for years, and an “official,” nonalcoholic version is served at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and the Warner Bros. Studio Tour. The Mirror claims that they’ve gotten the inside scoop on how to make the drink ― but don’t chug too much; their recipe sounds incredibly sweet. 5. Take our quiz and find out how much you really remember from the series. Are you a Muggle, or the brightest witch of your age? Be warned, this quiz is riddikulously hard. 6. Ogle the Bloomsbury 20th anniversary editions of “Harry Potter.” Bloomsbury These beauties come in four house color schemes, so you can flaunt your inner Gryffindor (or Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff, or Slytherin).

HuffPost And have a very Harry day. ||||| Exactly 20 years ago, J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” hit bookshelves, marking the birth of a massive franchise, both in literature and on the big screen. The films are lauded by fans by being largely faithful to Rowling’s beloved books, but there are a few key plotpoints that many wish had made it into the movies. In honor of the 20th anniversary milestone, Variety breaks down some of the biggest omissions. S.P.E.W. Ask any Hermione Granger fan what the biggest injustice of the “Harry Potter” movies was, and they’ll likely tell you S.P.E.W. Hermione founded S.P.E.W. — Society for the Promotion of Elvish Welfare — after witnessing the gross treatment of house-elves at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup. While the movement was highlighted briefly in the movies, thanks in large part to Dobby, S.P.E.W. saw Hermione as a champion for equal rights in the books. Harry’s appearance Fans differ on this point — while some argue that small differences in Harry’s appearance don’t hinder the overall plot of the films, others disagree. In the books, Harry has green eyes, mostly significant because they match his mother’s. However, Daniel Radcliffe reportedly had issues with colored contact lenses while shooting the films, hence his natural blue eyes. Radcliffe’s hair is also a dark brown; in the books, it’s depicted as jet black. Related Listen: How Broadway Made Daniel Radcliffe a Better Actor Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: The Best Gifts For Harry Potter Fans Weasley is Our King While Quidditch was mostly left out of the “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” movie, it played a big role in its corresponding book. When Ron, as Keeper, lets several big goals through during a Slytherin v. Gryffindor match, Draco Malfoy and the rest of the winning team compose a song, “Weasley is Our King,” to taunt him. Later, however, Gryffindor reclaims the chant and uses it to encourage Ron. Peeves Depending on who you were at Hogwarts, Peeves was either a delightful purveyor of mischief or a total pain. A fan-favorite poltergeist, Peeves was left out of the films completely. While there was one scene shot with Peeves, played by the late Rik Mayall, in “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” it was left on the cutting room floor (you can watch him talk about the role here.) Deathday Party Celebrations thrown by the ghosts of Hogwarts to celebrate the anniversaries of their deaths? Yes, please. The gloomy affairs are rarely attended by the living, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione went to Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington’s 500th Deathday Party in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,” which would have been a delightfully ghoulish scene to behold in the movie. Alice and Frank Longbottom There was plenty of Neville love given in the last film of the franchise (that had nothing to do with Matthew Lewis “Longbottoming”), but one big aspect of character was mostly omitted from the movies: the tragic story of his parents, Alice and Frank. Members of the original Order of the Phoenix, they were tortured to the point of insanity and live in St. Mungo’s. Neville goes to visit them frequently, though they, in a heartbreaking detail, never recognize him. The Marauders Fans often decry the lack of backstory given to some of J.K. Rowling’s most beloved characters, the Marauders, in the movies. Made up of Mooney (Remus Lupin), Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew), Padfoot (Sirius Black), and Prongs (James Potter), the mischief-making friends enjoyed a lot more detail in the books. It’s worth arguing, however, that the tale of the four boys is even more worthy of a spinoff. Peter Pettigrew’s Death Speaking of the Marauders, Peter Pettigrew had a much larger role in the books than the movies. In the “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” book, Wormtail goes to strangle Harry with a silver hand given to him by Voldemort, but hesitates after Harry notes that Peter owes him his life. In Peter’s moment of weakness, the hand turns on him, strangling him instead. No such scene is shown in the movies — his fate is only briefly teased after he’s stunned in a chamber. The Half-Blood Prince An extremely important part of “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” is — yup, you guessed it — the Half-Blood Prince himself. Harry, Ron, and Hermione spend a ton of time trying to figure out who the titular prince is in the book, a plotline that’s largely removed from the film. Of course, the mystery is revealed in the film as well (it’s Snape), but a lot of the build-up is missing. Did we miss your favorite part from the books? Let us know in the comments below! ||||| Today (June 26) marks 20 years since the publication of the first book in JK Rowling’s momentous Harry Potter series. And it truly is a day to celebrate: Rowling overcame financial difficulty, depression, and a dozen publishing house rejections before her incredible story was introduced to the world. Readers of all ages have Rowling to thank for their love of books, but I’m not here today to talk about her success. Her hundreds of millions of dollars speak for themselves, thank you very much. Instead, I’m taking a deep literary dive into Rowling’s work in order to discuss a crucial flaw of her prose. I’m talking, of course, about the incredibly lazy names she gave objects and characters in her Harry Potter series. Sure, Rowling created a world of magic and wonder that has delighted the hearts of literally millions of people. But she also named the Hogwarts House whose mascot is a snake “Slytherin,” as if “Snakey-Snake” was too on-the-nose. For the first time ever, here is a ranked list of the 10 laziest attempts by JK Rowling to name something in Harry Potter: 10. The Sorting Hat The Sorting Hat is A. sentient and B. responsible for one of the most important moments of a witch/wizard’s life, but apparently it isn’t smart enough to give itself a proper name. 9. The Knight Bus Get it, like a night bus? Tricky, tricky. 8. Chocoballs It’s as though they let a child who only knows two words name a candy. 7. The Fat Lady I guess at Hogwarts it’s cool to just say mean things whenever you want. 6. Sirius Black Well let’s see, this character will be very serious and wear a lot of black. Perhaps I’ll call him…Gloomy H. Guss. 5. The Hogwarts Express I guess if a train only has two stops it’d have to be an express, right? Also, what are they using this train for during the majority of the year? It must make like six trips total between September and June. With UK housing prices as high as they are, I’m sure they could make some dank cash by Airbnb-ing sections of the train to squibs. 4. The Chamber of Secrets The Chamber of Secrets is a supposedly secret chamber made by Salazar Slytherin just before he bitterly parted from Hogwarts. Here’s the thing: If the existence of the secret underground chamber you created is a known fact, and is also mockingly known as “The Chamber of Secrets,” you fucked something up really bad. 3. Wizard’s Chess After playing a game of Wizard’s Chess, Harry and Ron walked down the Wizard’s Sidewalk to buy a cup of Wizard’s Coffee from the Wizard’s Barista. 2. The Ministry of Magic I find this particularly irksome because the Ministry of Magic isn’t just a ministry devoted just to magic—it’s the UK wizarding world’s primary governing body. I’m sure there are things it deals with beyond the technical logistics of magic. It probably manages lots of complicated laws and menial paperwork and criminal matters that have nothing to do with magic, like a wizard just straight-up punching another wizard in the Wizard’s Face. 1. Kreacher In a children’s series filled with creatures who have fun, magical names, she chose to name one of the creatures Kreacher. Why did Kreacher get the short end of the name stick? Is it because he’s very ugly? In that case, why not just name him Ugly like she did the Fat Lady? Have some consistency, Rowling. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The 20th anniversary of the Harry Potter series was marked by nods of recognition on Twitter, Facebook, and even Google Earth.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Primary Producers/Food Sources Protists are essential sources of nutrition for many other organisms. In some cases, as in plankton, protists are consumed directly. Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms. For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae use sunlight to fix inorganic carbon. In this symbiotic relationship, these protists provide nutrients for coral polyps (Figure 23.29) that house them, giving corals a boost of energy to secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. In turn, the corals provide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis. This type of symbiotic relationship is important in nutrient-poor environments. Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching, and they eventually die. This explains why reefbuilding corals do not reside in waters deeper than 20 meters: insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.

Please answer the following question: Information: - George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868 February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory. - The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada. - Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley. - Theodore von Kármán (; 11 May 1881 6 May 1963) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, aerospace engineer, and physicist who was active primarily in the fields of aeronautics and astronautics. He is responsible for many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization. He is regarded as the outstanding aerodynamic theoretician of the twentieth century. - Amos Gager Throop (; 18111894) was a businessman and politician in Chicago, Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s. Most famously he was known for being a staunch abolitionist prior to the Civil War. In Chicago he lost two campaigns to be that city's mayor in 1852 and 1854. In both elections he was the nominee of the little-known Temperance Party, facing tough opposition from the Democratic Party. At the time of the Great Chicago Fire Amos was the city treasurer. He was instrumental in securing financing from New York to rebuild the wooden frontier town into a city of brick and mortar. Grateful Chicagoans renamed Main Street to Throop Street. Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888. - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students. Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College. - Aeronautics (from the ancient Greek words \\"r\\", which means \\"air\\", and \\"nautik\\" which means \\"navigation\\", i.e. \\"navigation into the air\\") is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flight capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of \\"aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering\\" and \\"the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics).\\" - Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868 December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect. - Hans Wolfgang Liepmann ( July 3 , 1914 -- June 24 , 2009 ) was an American engineer and emeritus Theodore von Kármán Professor of Aeronautics at the California Institute of Technology . He is known for his numerous contributions in fluid mechanics covering a wide range of problem areas , such as flow instability and turbulence , gas kinetics , viscous compressible fluids and liquid helium flows . - Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866 June 3, 1936) was a U.S. chemist, inventor and educator. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald. - Aerodynamics, from Greek \\"aer\\" (air) + (dynamics), is a branch of fluid dynamics concerned with studying the motion of air, particularly when it interacts with a solid object, such as an airplane wing. Aerodynamics is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics, and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. The term \\"aerodynamics\\" is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, with the difference being that \\"gas dynamics\\" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, not limited to air. Formal aerodynamics study in the modern sense began in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag have been recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics worked towards achieving heavier-than-air flight, which was first demonstrated by Wilbur and Orville Wright in 1903. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel experimentation, and computer simulations has formed the scientific basis for ongoing developments in heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies. Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to compressible flow, turbulence, and boundary layers and has become increasingly computational in nature. - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.

Bush briefly jumped back into the national conversation Tuesday night with his interview on \\"The Tonight Show.\\" Bush told host Jay Leno that \\"I don't miss the spotlight\\" and that he was thoroughly enjoying his post-presidential life. On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton is in the news as he receives a Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama. The two former presidents have taken a very different approach to their time after the White House. In an era when former presidents are often younger and healthier than in the past, the post-presidency offers a huge opportunity for them to help shape their legacies.","completion":"While one might expect former presidents to quietly fade away from the limelight, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have each crafted unique paths for themselves following their time in office. Bush has chosen to focus on his personal life and interests, indulging in his love for painting and spending time with his family. Meanwhile, Clinton has continued to engage in high-profile philanthropic efforts and global initiatives, working tirelessly to create a lasting impact in a variety of areas. Bush's path has been one of self-discovery and contentment as he stepped away from the intense scrutiny that comes with serving as the nation's leader. By doing so, he has allowed himself the much-needed space to explore his passions and develop a new sense of identity removed from the world of politics. His focus on personal growth has led to a unique transition from public life to private citizen. This approach to his post-presidency has offered him a sense of peace and satisfaction, leaving behind the stress and responsibility that came with his time in office. On the other hand, Clinton has taken on an impressive array of global challenges since leaving office in 2001. Through the establishment of the Clinton Foundation, he has tackled numerous issues ranging from public health to climate change. Clinton's dedication to making a positive and lasting impact on the world is evident in his many humanitarian pursuits, including disaster relief efforts and the promotion of economic growth in underserved communities. As he continues to shape his legacy, Clinton has become a dominant force in the sphere of philanthropy and global leadership. These contrasting approaches to post-presidential life demonstrate the spectrum of opportunities available to former presidents who are in relatively good health and have many years to continue making a difference. While Bush has obtained a sense of fulfillment from his personal pursuits, Clinton has found purpose through his relentless work to improve the well-being of others. Ultimately, the diverging post-presidential paths of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton serve as powerful reminders that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to shaping one's legacy after leaving the White House. Despite their different paths, both have found valuable ways to contribute to society and impact the world, presenting a nuanced view of the unique opportunities and challenges that former presidents face in their efforts to build upon their time in office."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84°3′N, was disappointing—Nansen had hoped they were farther south. However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained. On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey.

Contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to smooth, and because of the big wave action, the rocks are very smooth. Given these facts, what causes contact between rocks among the following options: - wind - heat - erosion - deltas - waves - motion - seasons - rivers","completion":"Among the given options, contact between rocks leading to their smoothing over long periods of time is mainly caused by: 1. Erosion: This is a natural process through which weathering breaks down the rock into smaller fragments, and eventually these fragments are transported by wind, water, or ice. As the rocks come in contact with one another during transportation, they smoothen over time due to continuous contact and grinding. 2. Waves: Ocean waves, in particular, play a significant role in smoothing rocks. As the waves repeatedly strike the rocks and drag them against the sand or along the shoreline, the rocks get worn down over time. This constant rubbing action leads to the formation of smooth rocks. 3. Rivers: Rocks found in riverbeds or near the banks of rivers also smoothen over time due to the continuous flow of water. The water current causes the rocks to collide with each other, and the grinding action from one rock against another wears down their edges, leading to smoother surfaces. While wind, heat, motion, seasons, and deltas can contribute to the overall weathering and erosion process, they are not the primary factors responsible for direct contact between rocks and subsequent smoothing. Wind and motion aid in transporting eroded rock fragments, and heat, seasons, and deltas can cause rocks to expand and contract, leading to cracks and breakage.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When did the author feel Lancome Juicy Tubes first changed her life?

I will subtract 1795 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the left side. 2047 - 1795 = -9 * n + 1795 - 1795 Which results in: 252 = -9 * n Step 3: Isolate the variable 'n'.

Today, we have a sad news to share with you. Do you know what a black rhinoceros is? It is a big, strong animal with thick skin and a big, pointy horn on its face. Rhinos, like elephants, live in Africa and like to roam around in the wild. They are very special and important animals. But you know what? We just found out that there are no wild black rhinos left in West Africa. This means you cannot see these wonderful animals living freely in nature anymore in that part of Africa. Isn't that very sad? Why did this happen, you ask? Well, the main reason is that some people have been hunting black rhinos for their horns. They sell the horns to other people who think they can use them for medicine or just want to have them because they look cool. However, this is very bad, since we should never hurt any animals or take things from them that they need. Besides hunting, black rhinos also lose their homes because people cut down trees and build houses or roads on their land. Just like you need a comfortable place to live, rhinos do too. We call their homes \\"habitats.\\" When we take their habitats away, they don't have enough food or places to hide from danger. So, what can we do about it? The most important thing is to learn how special animals like rhinos are and share this information with others. We can also try to protect nature and wild animals by planting trees, recycling, and not buying things made from animal parts. It is really important that we care about our planet and all the amazing creatures that live on it. If we work together, we can help save other animals like the black rhino from disappearing forever.

To unambiguously specify the date, dual dating or Old Style (O.S.) and New Style (N.S.) are sometimes used with dates. Dual dating uses two consecutive years because of differences in the starting date of the year, or includes both the Julian and Gregorian dates. Old Style and New Style (N.S.) indicate either whether the start of the Julian year has been adjusted to start on 1 January (N.S.) even though documents written at the time use a different start of year (O.S.), or whether a date conforms to the Julian calendar (O.S.) rather than the Gregorian (N.S.). The Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582. The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church.

C) They all go to the same school. D) A or B Steps: 1. First, eliminate option C because the fact that children go to the same school does not influence their appearance or make it difficult to tell their gender. 2. Consider option A, which states that boys and girls often wear the same kinds of clothes in western countries. This could indeed make it difficult to distinguish their gender based on appearance. 3. Next, consider option B, which suggests that many children in western countries have long hair. This could also make it difficult to distinguish their gender, as long hair is often associated with both boys and girls. 4. Finally, consider option D, which combines both options A and B. Since both A and B provide valid reasons why it might be difficult to tell whether a child is a boy or a girl in western countries, option D is the most suitable answer.

Here's my step-by-step analysis of the review and the reasons behind my conclusion: 1. The review title \\"ARROGANT TRY\\" gives a negative impression suggesting that the creator's attempt was not successful, and they were overly confident about the product. 2. The reviewer mentions that the director is \\"arrogant\\" and \\"makes them furious,\\" which is a strong negative emotion. This indicates dissatisfaction with the product, which is a barrier to purchasing the product. 3. The comparison with \\"SCHINDLER'S LIST\\" suggests that this product has lesser depth of character, therefore it might not be as engaging or well-developed as other highly praised works. 4. The reviewer implies that the director was attempting to win OSCARS, suggesting that the focus might have been more on gaining recognition rather than on producing a genuinely good product. This can lower the expectation of the product's quality. 5. The reviewer specifically states that the plot is weak. A weak plot can make the product less enjoyable and less likely to be recommended to others.

She had originally intended to take one year off, but despite working on material, twelve years passed before her next album release. Her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release. The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens's Great Expectations. In 1998, Bush gave birth to Albert, known as \\"Bertie\\", fathered by her guitarist and now husband Danny McIntosh. In 2001, Bush was awarded a Q Award as Classic Songwriter.

Kate Bush's eighth studio album, Aerial, was released on double CD and vinyl in November 2005. The album single \\"King of the Mountain\\", had its premiere on BBC Radio 2 two months prior. The single entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six, and would become Bush's third-highest-charting single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart. Aerial entered the UK albums chart at number three, and the US chart at number 48.Aerial, as on Hounds of Love (1985), is divided into two sections, each with its own theme and mood. The first disc, subtitled A Sea of Honey, features a set of unrelated themed songs, including \\"King of the Mountain\\"; \\"Bertie\\", a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and \\"Joanni\\", based on the story of Joan of Arc. In the song \\" π {displaystyle pi } \\", Bush sings 117 digits of the number Pi. The second disc, subtitled A Sky of Honey, features one continuous piece of music describing the experience of 24 hours passing by.

But prosperity remains a dream for many Mexicans, and the socio-economic gap remains wide. Rural areas are often neglected and huge shanty towns ring the cities. Many poor Mexicans have sought to cross the 3,000-km border with the US in search of a job but in recent years more Mexicans immigrants have returned to Mexico than migrated to the US. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in drugs-related gang violence in the past decade. Powerful cartels control the trafficking of drugs from South America to the US.

Having promised major changes to the way Mexico is run, Mr Pena Nieto has pushed ground-breaking reforms, including closing corporate tax loopholes, liberalising the telecoms industry and opening the longstanding state energy monopoly to private competition. But rampant gang violence, corruption and the weak state authority remain festering sores, feeding growing public disenchantment.

What most naturally follows? How to ease sore muscles after a hard workout Ice your sore muscles. When put ice on your muscles, your blood vessels contract, which reduces the swelling in your muscles and can relieve pain. You can either take a cold shower or use an ice pack to the same effect.","completion":"After a hard workout, it's essential to take proper care of your sore muscles to ease the discomfort and promote a quick recovery. Icing your muscles is an effective way to reduce inflammation and pain, but there are several other methods you can also incorporate to support the recovery process. Here's a list of effective tips to help ease muscle soreness after a workout. 1. Stretching: Gentle stretching after a workout can help increase your flexibility and soothe muscle soreness. Focus on the major muscle groups that you worked during your exercise and hold each stretch for about 15-30 seconds. 2. Hydration: Staying properly hydrated is crucial both during and post-workout, as it helps flush out waste products from your muscles and can prevent dehydration, which might contribute to muscle soreness. 3. Warm-Up and Cool-Down: Always perform a dynamic warm-up before your workout to prepare your muscles for more intense activity. Similarly, a proper cool-down can help prevent soreness by slowly decreasing the intensity of your workout and allowing your heart rate to return to normal. 4. Foam Rolling: Foam rolling, also known as self-myofascial release, can help relieve muscle tightness and discomfort by applying gentle pressure to adhesions, or \\"knots,\\" in your muscles. Spend a few minutes foam rolling the affected muscles to help increase blood flow and decrease stiffness. 5. Heat Therapy: While icing your muscles can help alleviate immediate inflammation and pain, applying heat after the initial 24-48 hours can promote muscle relaxation and ease stiffness. Soak in a warm bath or use a heating pad on your sore muscles for 15-20 minutes. 6. Consider Over-the-Counter Pain Relief: If you're experiencing severe soreness, you may want to consider over-the-counter pain relief medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. However, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before using any medications, especially if you have any pre-existing conditions or take other medications regularly. 7. Nutrition: A well-rounded, balanced diet provides your body with the necessary nutrients to fuel your workouts and promote recovery. Consuming foods rich in protein and complex carbohydrates can help repair and rebuild muscle tissue, while anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce inflammation. 8. Rest and Recovery: Giving your muscles adequate time to recover is essential in preventing excessive soreness and reducing the risk of injury. Ensure that you get enough sleep and schedule rest days into your workout routine, especially when incorporating high-intensity workouts or strength training sessions. 9. Gradual Progression: Avoid overworking your muscles too quickly by gradually increasing the intensity, duration, and frequency of your workouts over time. This allows your body to adapt to the increased levels of stress and can minimize the risk of excessive soreness and injury. 10. Massage: Treatment with a professional massage therapist can help relieve muscle soreness by improving circulation, reducing tension, and breaking down knots in your muscles. Alternatively, you can try self-massage using your hands, a foam roller, or a massage ball. By incorporating these methods into your post-workout routine, you can effectively ease sore muscles and support recovery, allowing you to continue with your fitness journey more comfortably."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Tracy Connor and Stephanie Siegel Jihad Jane, the American-born Muslim convert convicted of plotting to kill a cartoonist who satirized the Prophet Muhammad, says she was motivated by love — and feminine pride. In a jailhouse letter to a criminologist, Colleen LaRose gave no sense that she regrets the crimes that landed her in federal lockup for 10 years. \\"Why did I do what I was convicted of?\\" LaRose wrote in response to a query from Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco, who plans to write a book based on the correspondence, which she shared with NBC News. \\"There’s many reasons but the simplest reason is I did it for love. Love for my Prophet, love for my Ummah [community] and love for the brother that gave me the assignment,\\" she wrote. \\"Also I think I did it for pride. Sisters are never given assignments like the one I was given. I felt my brother had enough confidence and trust in me that he honored me by giving me the assignment. I felt if he loved me that much then I had to do what he told me needed to be done.\\" Colleen LaRose, known by the self-created pseudonym of \\"Jihad Jane\\", is pictured in this photo released by Site Intelligence Group on March 10, 2010. ite Intelligence Group viReuters LaRose, 51, who called herself Jihad Jane online, pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to murder a foreign target, supporting terrorists and lying to the FBI and got a reduced sentence in exchange for cooperating with investigators. She admitted that she plotted to kill Lars Vilks, an artist who drew Muhammad's face on a dog's head in a cartoon, outraging many Muslims. Mehlman-Orozco, who has a doctorate in criminology from George Mason University, wrote to LaRose well before last week's terrorist attack on a satirical Paris magazine that had stoked similar outrage with cartoons of Muhammad. She sent letters to 17 people convicted in the U.S. of terrorist-related crimes with the goal of writing a book about how they view their crimes and whether that could improve counter-terrorism techniques. Twelve of the prisoners did not get the letters because of prison restrictions. Of the five who did, four wrote back: LaRose; Richard Reid, the British national serving life for trying to blow up a plane with a shoe-bomb in 2001; and two brothers convicted in 2008 of a plot to attack soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey. \\"In order to understand why these things are happening we need to look at the crime through their eyes,\\" Mehlman-Orozco said. The Fort Dix brothers, Shain and Eljvir Duka, responded with letters that professed their innocence. Reid sent a three-page reply in which he spouted jihadi justifications while tackling the question of any connection between Islam and terrorism. \\"For the Muslim, our religion teaches us that if our religions or lands are attacked, it is our duty to defend them — if necessary with our lives,\\" he wrote. \\"So 'terrorism' is simply a tactic which has been employed in that regards, mostly due to the fact that it's the only weapon we have.\\" 28-year-old alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid is shown in this December 24, 2001 police photograph. Plymouth County Jail / Getty Images LaRose — an abuse victim who became entranced with Islam after a one-night stand with a Muslim in 2007, according to a Reuters investigation of her case — clung to the same logic, blaming U.S. military operations in the Middle East and \\"Zionists\\" for sparking terrorism. \\"Just think of it like America was invaded and occupied by enemy forces and these forces killed men women and children and caused many families to loose [sic] their homes,\\" LaRose wrote. \\"If this type of thing happen in America of course Americans would fight back and do what has to be done to end the occupation of their land.\\" Mehlman-Orozco, who started her own non-profit dedicated to human-trafficking and immigration, said she is still waiting for new letters from LaRose and Reid, including answers to their view of the Paris carnage. \\"I think there is some value in understanding how they perceive it,\\" she said. ||||| Terrorist Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a jetliner with a shoe-bomb after 9/11, says he failed because that's what God wanted. In a letter from the supermax prison in Colorado where he is serving a life sentence, Reid told a researcher he believes the bungled 2001 attempt to kill 197 passengers on American Airlines Flight 63 was permitted by Islamic law. \\"I admit many people would dispute that and disagree with me on that point,\\" the British-born Reid, 41, wrote. \\"However, at the same time I also believe that it wasn't supposed to happen, not because it was displeasing to God … rather because it was not either my time to die nor that of those on the plane with me, and he had other plans for me which include my staying in prison and other matters which I may not be aware of as of yet.\\" Reid's plan was foiled when a flight attendant saw him struggling to light a fuse coming from his shoe, which contained a plastic explosive. He was subdued by passengers and sedated by two doctors on board the flight from Paris to Miami.

His response suggests he wishes he had planned the attack better. \\"I do have some tactical regrets of a sort which I won't go into here, but I don't regret losing my freedom,\\" he wrote. In another letter to Mehlman-Orozco, Reid addressed the terrorist attacks on the Paris offices of the satirical publication Charlie Hebdo which had published a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed. \\"I do not see what happened at Charlie Hebdo as a tragedy,\\" he said. \\"Rather the tragedy is that people think it is OK to demean the sacred and belittle that which is more beloved to we Muslims than their own souls.\\" He added, \\"And as the saying goes, if you play with fire you might get burned, so I have no tears for those who insult Islam.\\" Mehlman-Orozco, who runs a non-profit called the Justitia Institute and has written to several convicted terrorists, said the letter shows how once terrorists are radicalized, they cling to their twisted interpretation of Islam, even after more than a decade in isolation. \\"It withstands the cost versus the benefit, it withstands the will to live, it withstands years in the toughest prison in America,\\" she said.

Rihanna close to a deal to design for Puma Rihanna is close to inking a seven-figure deal to design sneakers and clothing for Puma, Confidenti@l has learned. We’re told the sportswear giant is already building a team to work on the “lifestyle” line. “She is going to have her own coordinator to go to at Puma who only handles her, and they’ll have a junior coordinator helping them,” said our insider. “The focus is shoes, but she will also be helping with pants and tops.” We’re told the contract is worth just over 1 million and will prevent the Adidas-obsessed star from wearing rivals’ brands. “She will have to slowly start to incorporate Puma into her wardrobe,” said the source. “She will be wearing all Puma gear in shoots and out and about.” While RiRi hasn’t made it official yet, we hear she’s on board. “The offer isn’t signed yet, but she is in 100% and wants to do this,” the source added. The Barbadian star, who has built a reputation around her daring style, has been flirting with the fashion business for some time. In 2011, she worked on underwear and jeans for Armani, and she has since co-designed a line for British store River Island with Adam Selman, who has created some her most dramatic red carpet looks. Last year, she also put together two makeup collections for luxury brand MAC. “It’s not all down to my voice,” she told British Vogue in February. “There’s people with way more talent than I when it comes to singing; bigger voices. But people want to know who you are. Fashion is a clear indication, a way to express your attitude, your mood,” she said. Over the summer, the star — real name, Robyn Fenty — even filed for a series of trademarks, including the names Fenty Apparel and Fenty Clothing, leading to widespread speculation that her own line is on its way. This wouldn’t be Puma’s first time at the celebrity collaboration rodeo. The German multinational hired Beyoncé’s sister Solange Knowles as an “art director” in February, releasing a collection of out-there sneakers that she worked on with “some of (her) favorite emerging artists, photographer (and) graphic designers).” Puma also worked with superstar interior designer and architect Philippe Starck on a range of Croc-like sneakers and his Starck Naked Bodywear line of underwear between 2004 and 2007. Nonetheless, the firm has some catching up to do with archrival Adidas, which has scored a huge hit with its Adidas Yeezy series with Kanye West. Reps for Puma and Rihanna did not respond to our requests for comment. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. Rihanna is close to signing a seven-figure deal to design sneakers and clothing for Puma. 2. Puma is building a team to work on the \\"lifestyle\\" line Rihanna will be involved in. 3.

Matt Franklin is a recent MIT graduate who works at a Los Angeles Suncoast Video store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser.

What's a sentence that uses these characters?","completion":"A Venus transit through the fifth house in astrology is a remarkable aspect that differs in its implications for each individual, acting as a cipher for various meaningful occurrences that play out in a person's life. For some, this celestial movement might signify the blossoming of a love affair, imbuing their life with joy, affection, and profound emotional connection, acting as a chapter in their romantic narrative that is filled with happiness. Painted with the brushstrokes of love, their world takes on a brighter hue, every moment is on the cusp of spring, and the days are festooned with the music of the heart. A Venus transit stands as a cosmic promise, one that ushers in an era of sentimental warmth and a preservation of affectionate moments, all narrating a story of love that is unique to one individual. For others, the transit might denote an artistically creative period, a time where their canvas of life is drenched in hues undiscovered and shapes yet unraveled. Like a poet finding the right verses, like a painter discovering new colors, or a musician composing unique melodies, this period becomes a testament to their blossoming creativity. Every day morphs into an adventure of sorts, where their mind gets wooed by imagination and heart, becomes a reservoir of unexpressed emotions waiting to be skillfully portrayed. Their art becomes their voice, their creativity finds a home, and every masterpiece they create becomes a mirror to their soul. This period acts as a fertile ground for numerous artists, allowing them to dive into the depths of their creativity and to surface with pearls of artistic wisdom and expression. In summation, a Venus transit through the fifth house can herald contrasting phases of life for different individuals. It can symbolize a chapter of life vibrantly colored by the strokes of romantic love for one person, and paint an entirely unique picture of artistic exploration and creativity for another. Despite the distinct experiences, it's notable that both outcomes share a commonality: they refract the light of personal growth, exploration, and deep emotional revelation in their own distinctive ways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation: -411*r + (24375 + 6118) = -5675 3. Calculate the sum of the constant terms: -411*r + 30493 = -5675 4. Now, we want to isolate the term with the variable (r) on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 30493 from both sides of the equation: -411*r = -5675 - 30493 5. Calculate the new constant on the right side of the equation: -411*r = -36168 6. To solve for r, we need to get rid of the coefficient -411. We will do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -411: r = (-36168) / (-411) 7.

Nikkhil Advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters. The screenplay is dull, probably he was drunk when he was writing this film. There is no strong hold on any of these stories. Nothing new , nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before. One of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it. I mean seriously is this story really required? Its not funny, not creative but only proves that Advani has no sense of comedy. Another of the stories (which was probably the only story I was interested in) is based on a man's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age-old sati-savitri pati-parmeshwar crap. I have no idea what the Salmaan-Priyanka plot was all about. There was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot. She can't take Karan Johar's film because she has to marry Salmaan ?? Why can't she marry him and still take the film ?? or does Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married?? With six actors in the film obviously Advani cant produce the film all by himself. So he makes full use of sponsors like the Times group, shamelessly promoting their Filmfare magazines.

Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.Darius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father's last words were not a warning, but a challenge. If only the gods can defeat the Greeks, then, she tells him, he is to become the god king.Artemisia has Xerxes sent into the desert wearing chains until he walks into a cave with a pool of bright gold liquid.

Step 2: Assess the information given John works for the NSF and has two research proposals (A and B) for further funding. Case A research has been replicated by other researchers, while case B research could not be replicated by others. Step 3: Analyze the situation Replicability is a crucial aspect of the scientific method. If the findings of a research study can be replicated by other researchers, it means that the study's methods and results are reliable and valid. In contrast, if a study cannot be replicated, it can indicate possible issues with the study's methods, results, or even the integrity of the researchers involved (in rarer cases, scientific misconduct or fraud). Step 4: Conclude Based on the information provided, it is more likely that a scientist would have committed fraud in case B, as the research could not be replicated by others. This raises questions about the validity and reliability of the study and introduces doubts about its scientific integrity.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The flu virus has receptors, which are like viral Velcro, on the surface of the virus particle - The receptors will lock onto a target cell using these chemical receptors on the surface, which docks onto the cell surface - The receptors then go into the cell - The receptors use it like a factory - The receptors take it over and make it produce thousands or in some cases millions of copies of new viruses - The copies come streaming out of the cell - The copies infect other cells to make more viruses, or they escape from the body and infect a new victim - Question: suppose the person is able to fight off the virus happens, how will it affect MORE cells being damaged. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"When a person is able to effectively fight off a virus, such as the flu, it results in less damage to their cells over time. This would correspond to answer choice B: less. To better understand this, let's take a closer look at the immune response and how it helps protect cells from viral damage. When a person is infected with a virus, their immune system starts to respond and initiate a series of defensive actions. These actions are designed to neutralize and eliminate the virus from the body, ultimately minimizing the spread and damage of the virus to the cells. 1. Detection: The immune system recognizes the virus as a foreign invader. This is usually achieved through the detection of viral proteins by specialized white blood cells called macrophages. 2. Alert: Once the virus is detected, the immune system generates signaling molecules, called cytokines and chemokines, to alert other immune cells and attract them to the site of infection. 3. Activation of immune cells: The alerted immune cells are then activated and directed to eliminate the virus. These cells include natural killer (NK) cells, T-cells, and B-cells. NK cells can directly kill virus-infected cells by recognizing and binding to them. T-cells help to coordinate the immune response, and some types of T-cells (cytotoxic T-cells) can directly kill virus-infected cells. B-cells produce and secrete antibodies that can neutralize the virus, preventing it from entering new cells. 4. Memory and protection: Once the virus is cleared, some immune cells transition into memory cells. These memory cells remain in the body, providing long-lasting immunity against the specific virus and allowing for a faster and more efficient response if the same virus tries to infect the body again. As the immune response progresses, the virus's ability to infect more cells and reproduce is hindered, reducing the overall damage to the individual's cells. This means that the person will experience less overall damage from the viral infection. In conclusion, if a person is able to effectively fight off the flu virus, the immune system's response will help prevent the virus from infecting and damaging additional cells. This results in less cellular damage over time and better overall health outcomes for the infected individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

When the team reprograms and opens the sealed blast doors, they are slaughtered by the massive crowd of infected. With the infected released outside, they reach Raccoon City, spreading the infection among the general populace. Two days after the infection has spread to the surface, Umbrella, worried about possible worldwide contamination, quarantines Raccoon City and establishes a security perimeter around it, also evacuating all important Umbrella personnel out of the city. However, a girl named Angela Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur), daughter of the Level 6 Umbrella researcher Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared Harris), who is also the T-virus creator, goes missing, after an Umbrella security car transporting her out of Raccoon City suffers a traffic accident. Alice awakens in the deserted Raccoon City hospital attached to wiring, and after strapping herself out of the wiring, she manages to unlock her room and step outside.

As she steps out of the deserted Raccoon City hospital where she finds herself attached to wiring, she discovers the city is now a ghost town, filled with infected individuals. This shotgun becomes her primary weapon for self-defense and to combat the infected as she navigates through the city in search of supplies. In addition to the shotgun, Alice also gains superhuman agility and strength as a result of the experimentation conducted on her. These newfound abilities significantly enhance her combat and survival skills, making her a formidable force against the infected and any other threats she encounters throughout the movie. The film revolves around the catastrophic consequences of the T-virus outbreak originating from The Hive (as seen in the first Resident Evil movie). With Raccoon City now under quarantine by the Umbrella Corporation, Alice joins forces with disgraced police officer Jill Valentine and other characters, such as Sergeant Payton Wells, in an effort to escape the city before it is completely destroyed. During their journey, they must also search for Angela Ashford, the daughter of Level 6 Umbrella researcher Dr. Charles Ashford, who created the T-virus. Dr. Ashford offers the group a way out of the city in exchange for Angela's safe return, adding an element of urgency to their mission. In determining whether or not to invest in this film proposal, it is crucial to consider several factors. These include the potential popularity of the film based on its story and action-packed plot, the continuance from the previous installment \\"Resident Evil,\\" and the successful incorporation of well-known characters from the popular video game series upon which the movie franchise is based. Additionally, it's essential to assess the marketability of the film, given the established fanbase and the possibility for generating profits through merchandising and future sequels.

Here is an article: He put computer chips in the wallets of commuters in London, charged a fee to drive in the center of the city and helped lure the next Summer Olympics there. Now Jay Walder, the public transportation expert who helped turn London’s aging transit system into an (albeit expensive) envy of the globe, wants to take his brand of high-tech transit reform to the city where he got his start, New York. Mr. Walder, 50, was nominated on Tuesday as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the nation’s biggest transit agency, which was on the brink of financial collapse just two months ago. Gov. David A. Paterson said he chose Mr. Walder because he was an independent leader who would bring efficiency and accountability to a notoriously unwieldy agency. Mr. Walder said he planned to “restore the public trust and confidence” in the authority, a perennial target of the city’s collective kvetching. Still, a vote by the State Senate on the confirmation of Mr. Walder is unlikely to happen for months, until it returns from its summer break. And he did not elaborate on his plans if he is confirmed, except to say he expected “to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions.” “I certainly go in with my eyes open,” Mr. Walder said at a news conference. “I’ve been away for nearly 15 years, and I’ve certainly got a lot of catching up to do.” A native of the Rockaways who rode the A train as a child, Mr. Walder began his career in public service in the darker days of New York’s transit system, when graffiti and crime were rampant. He helped lead the transportation authority out of a financial black hole in the mid-1980s and held several leadership positions, including chief financial officer, before moving to London in 2001. His experience there, as the planning and finance director of Transport for London under Robert R. Kiley, his former boss in New York, offers hints about what might lie in store for New Yorkers. Mr. Walder led the introduction of the Oyster card, a “smart card” that uses a computer chip to track riders’ fares and account balances. Unlike the MetroCard, with its familiar swipe, the thicker Oyster requires no contact: it is waved over a sensor. In a report presented to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last spring, Mr. Walder  in his capacity as a consultant at McKinsey & Company, where he has worked since leaving the London transit system in 2006  said that elements of the smart-card plan would be feasible for New York. The transportation authority has started a pilot program involving fare cards that do not require contact. At the news conference Tuesday, Mr. Walder spoke highly of the Oyster card but stopped short of saying he would import the program. And he did not address the issue of fare increases; in London, subway rides start at 2.60 but can rise above 20, depending on the length of the ride and the time of day. Mr. Walder also was instrumental in starting the program to charge drivers in central London, where it initially incensed drivers but eventually was welcomed as a way to reduce congestion. A similar plan, advanced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was scuttled by the Legislature last year. The governor’s announcement came less than 24 hours before the State Senate was to reconvene, and lawmakers said they did not expect a vote soon. “This week? That’s ludicrous,” said Carl Kruger, a Brooklyn Democrat who laughed when asked whether the committee he chaired would review Mr. Walder in the next few days. “This is the M.T.A.,” Mr. Kruger said. “It’s not as if we’re confirming somebody to be game warden of the Adirondack Park.” Many top officials, including Mr. Bloomberg, had yet to meet with Mr. Walder before the governor made his announcement. The board of the transportation authority had its first talk with the nominee in a hastily arranged meeting on Tuesday morning, hours after Mr. Walder flew in from London, where he lives with his wife and three children. Several board members said they were impressed with Mr. Walder’s credentials, but they added that the half-hour discussion did not delve into many details. “Trying to have a deeper conversation with someone that jet-lagged is a little silly,” said H. Dale Hemmerdinger, who has been leading the authority since Elliot G. Sander resigned as chief executive in May. If confirmed, Mr. Walder will have to navigate a political minefield where he must consider the competing interests of state, city and county groups, while balancing a multibillion-dollar budget that nearly forced drastic service cuts and fare increases this year. “He’s taking on being the head of the M.T.A. at the time when its finances are the worst they’ve been in at least a quarter of a century,” said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for riders. Public faith in the agency is also low. “Any long-term solution to funding requires us as the M.T.A. to show people we are using funding as efficiently and effectively as possible,” Mr. Walder said. One board member suggested that even if he was confirmed, it might take some time for Mr. Walder to bring about changes. “He’s going to do a lot more listening than talking in the next six months,” said Mitchell H. Pally, a board member from Suffolk County. “People in the system need someone to yell at.” Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Jay Walder, the Public Transportation Expert Who Revamped London's Transit System, Nominated as Chairman of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: On Monday, Sept.25, hundreds of people gathered outside the Library of Congress, in Washington D.C., to celebrate public libraries. For more than 100 years, libraries have played an important role in keeping America informed and educated. But how are these book-filled buildings changing with the times? You may be surprised to find out. Benjamin Franklin famously founded America's first lending library in 1731 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. And the public library system developed greatly in the late 1800's. Businessman Andrew Carnegie donated millions of dollars to help build free public libraries across the country. Between 1886 and 1919, Carnegie's donations helped build 1,679 new libraries! Carnegie believed in the opportunities that libraries could offer Americans young and old. He knew that the more libraries there were, the more people would have access to books, lectures, news and more. \\"There are now more public libraries in the United States than McDonald's restaurants,\\" said Clara Hayden, of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library. Chances are that there is a public library in or near your community . After all, the United States is home to 9,225 public libraries. Today, libraries continue to develop and grow. Seven out of ten libraries offer free Internet access. This opens any doors for community members who cannot go online at home, including the opportunity to apply for jobs online. Libraries are also teaching kids about the fun of reading. One new program called Read! Play! ----- combines reading with playtime. As kids listen to a book being read aloud, they use Legos to build images from the story. \\"Today's libraries are always looking for creative programming to bring people into the library,\\" Lego's Michael McNally said. Benjamin Franklin once said, \\"The doors of wisdom are never shut.\\" As long as the doors of public libraries are open, his statement is most certainly true!

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

Article: After a series of high-level White House leaks portraying Steve Bannon as fed up with his job and ready to quit, Trump's chief strategist has told associates the stories are \\"100 percent nonsense\\" and he's playing for keeps. Even for this leaky, rivalrous White House, the Bannon broadside was brutal. Numerous officials torched the senior adviser in media stories, did nothing to soften the Bannon-loses-power narrative and watched gleefully as Drudge and others trumpeted his fall. Truth is, the hatred between the two wings is intense and irreconcilable. The two sides: The Bannonites believe the liberals staged a coup and will turn Trump into a conventional squish who betrays the very voters who brought him to power. The Jared wing thinks the Bannonites are clinically nuts. Killing Bannon won't be easy: His staunchest ally is one of Trump's closest confidants — Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Kellyanne Conway will go to the mat for him, as will policy advisor Stephen Miller. He's also built strong relationships with other cabinet secretaries including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. In the end, though, family matters most and all but dad are done with Bannon and his politics. Bannon's allies on the outside include, as Trump might say, some \\"bad hombres.\\" \\"Steve has developed strong and important relationships with some of the most powerful right-leaning business leaders,\\" said a close Bannon ally outside of the White House. \\"I see some bad press in [Jared's] future.\\" ||||| The man credited with honing Donald Trump’s populist message and guiding him into the White House has grown frustrated amid continued infighting in the West Wing, so much so that in recent weeks a top donor had to persuade him to stay in his position. Five people, including a senior administration official and several sources close to the president, tell POLITICO that Steve Bannon, one of Trump’s closest advisers, has clashed with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who’s taken on an increasingly prominent portfolio in the West Wing. Bannon has complained that Kushner and his allies are trying to undermine his populist approach, the sources said. Story Continued Below Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer, a longtime Bannon confidante who became a prominent Trump supporter during the campaign, urged Bannon not to resign. “Rebekah Mercer prevailed upon him to stay,” said one person familiar with the situation. Another person familiar with the situation, a GOP operative who talks to Mercer, said: “Bekah tried to convince him that this is a long-term play.” Bannon has worked closely with Mercer not only at the right-wing website Breitbart News, where her family is a major investor and where he served as executive chairman until joining the Trump campaign in August, but also at Cambridge Analytica, the data-analytics firm owned largely by the Mercers. Bannon is a part owner of the firm, though he’s trying to sell his stake, and until recently he served as vice president of the company’s board. The White House said Bannon had not taken any steps to leave, and Bannon told POLITICO that any suggestion he threatened to resign was “total nonsense.” At Breitbart, Bannon, 63, was among the earliest Trump supporters and is credited with building the ideological foundation of the Trump movement. A former investment banker of considerable means, he is somebody the president views as an equal — and whose departure would scramble the pecking order of a White House that seems to have chaos in its DNA. “It hasn’t all been fun, and I know he’s been frustrated,” said a Republican who has spoken with Bannon in recent weeks. His position in the West Wing took a blow on Wednesday, when the White House issued a national security directive removing him from the National Security Council, where he had been installed as a member in the first weeks of the administration. Bannon opposed the change, even saying he’d quit if the president signed off on it, according to one person familiar with the situation. His allies inside the White House downplayed the significance of the reassignment, casting his initial elevation to the NSC as a temporary position that had come to a natural conclusion. But Bannon's removal from the NSC is symbolic of a broader realignment in the West Wing that has Bannon increasingly marginalized and at odds both with the president and Kushner. Bannon has generated a thrum of controversy since he joined the Trump campaign as chief executive in August, and the consistent drumbeat of negative press coverage surrounding him has strained his relationship with Trump, who monitors media reports closely, according to a source familiar with the situation. Bannon has also butted heads with Kushner, the president’s senior adviser, who considers him an ideologue whose advice to Trump is making it harder for the president to win popular support for his agenda, according to people familiar with the dynamic.

The tension between the two is indicative of a larger power struggle in the White House as Kushner’s prominence and responsibility have ballooned. He has helped to expand the authority of two senior West Wing officials who, like him, are less ideological in nature: former Goldman Sachs executives Gary Cohn, who is now chairman of the National Economic Council, and Dina Powell, the deputy national security adviser for strategy. The national security directive removing Bannon from the NSC explicitly authorized Powell to attend the National Security Council's Principals' and Deputies' Committee meetings. The “big fight is between nationalists and the West Wing Democrats,” said a person familiar with Bannon’s thinking. “You have these New York interlocutors who are just not political and who want to think that they’re above the way Washington thinks, but if anybody is allied on delivering on things that Trump ran on, it’s Bannon and Reince and the vice president,” said the Republican who has spoken to Bannon recently. Kushner has also told people that he thinks Mercer and her father, the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer — who poured 13 million into a super PAC that supported Ted Cruz’s campaign in the Republican primary and came around to Trump after he won the nomination — have taken too much credit for their role in Trump's victory, and he has expressed misgivings about their go-it-alone approach to outside spending boosting Trump’s agenda. “If Bannon leaves the White House, Bekah’s access and influence shrinks dramatically,” said the GOP operative who talks to Mercer. Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Steve Bannon, President Trump's chief strategist, has denied media reports that he is fed up with his job and ready to quit, claiming the stories are \\"100 percent nonsense.\\" Despite this, Bannon has been the subject of negative press coverage that is straining his relationship with Trump, while he has also clashed with Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: Then, under cover of darkness, Drake sent out attack boats to destroy the Spanish frigates. Sentence 2: Drake took his brigade south to avoid an altercation with the Spanish. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences describe two different actions taken by Drake at different moments in time or even in different scenarios and contexts. In the first sentence, \\"Then, under cover of darkness, Drake sent out attack boats to destroy the Spanish frigates,\\" Drake is being described as launching a direct, aggressive attack on the Spanish frigates using attack boats. This action takes place at nighttime, which suggests an element of surprise and a desire for an advantage over the opponent. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Drake took his brigade south to avoid an altercation with the Spanish,\\" describes a less confrontational approach taken by Drake. Here, Drake is portrayed as a leader who aims to avoid a potential conflict with the Spanish forces by changing the direction of his brigade in a strategically non-provocative manner. The two sentences could describe actions taken at different points during a larger conflict or could be part of separate storylines altogether. It is important to note that the relationship between these two sentences is not based on logical entailment, but they could potentially be related as part of a more complex narrative. A logical entailment would mean that if Sentence 1 is true, Sentence 2 must also be true. In conclusion, while both sentences involve Drake and the Spanish forces, the actions described in each sentence are distinct and independent, and therefore the second sentence does not entail the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: S/he will examine the infected area and take an x-ray. to determine the severity of the situation and identify the best treatment. S/he will examine the position of the tooth to see whether it has fully or partially emerged from the gums. Your dentist will also take note of the condition of the surrounding gums. If the wisdom tooth has not yet emerged, the dentist may need to perform an x-ray to locate the tooth and identify its position. These factors will influence whether or not the tooth will need to be removed. Don’t forget your medical history. Your dentist will want to know if you’re allergic to any medication. Consult with your dentist about how much the procedure will cost. You should also ask about all the risks and benefits of the treatment, as well as any alternative treatments that may be an option. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. You have the right to understand your medical care. If the wisdom tooth is about to emerge from the gums without any problems and the infection is not too severe, the dentist may be able to clear the infection by simply cleaning the area with an antiseptic solution. The dentist will remove any infected tissue, pus, food debris or plaque from around the area. If there is an abscess on the gums, sometimes a small incision will be made to drain the pus. After the cleaning, your dentist will recommend home care for you to follow over the next few days. This might include mouth gels to bring down inflammation, antibiotics to fully clear the infection, and painkillers to relieve any pain. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include Amoxicillin, Clindamycin, and Penicillin. One of the main causes of wisdom tooth infection is when a section of gum covering the wisdom tooth — known as the gum flap —becomes infected due to bacteria, plaque and food debris becoming trapped underneath it. If the tooth is still buried within the gums (but is positioned to emerge from the gums correctly) it is often easier to remove the infected gum flap than the tooth itself. Your dentist might schedule a minor surgical procedure called an ‘operculectomy’, in which the soft gum tissue covering the wisdom tooth is removed. Once removed, the area will be a lot easier to keep clean and free of plaque and bacteria, which greatly reduces the chances of the wisdom tooth becoming reinfected. Before the procedure, your dentist will numb the area with a local anesthetic. S/he will then remove the infected tissue flap using surgical scalpel blades, lasers or electrocautery methods. If you have suffered from multiple infections and your wisdom tooth shows no sign of emerging on its own, it may be necessary to have the tooth removed. Extraction may also be necessary if the infection is very severe. Depending on the position of the tooth, the extraction will be conducted by your dentist or by an oral surgeon. The dentist will give you a local anaesthetic and will remove the tooth. You may be prescribed antibiotics and painkillers to prevent further infection and relieve any pain. It is essential that you follow your dentist's advice regarding good oral hygiene practices. You will need to schedule a follow-up appointment with your dentist to inspect the gums to ensure they are healing properly. The dentist will check the positioning of the opposite wisdom tooth, in case it need to be removed also. Summary:","completion":"A dentist will check your mouth and might take an x-ray to see a wisdom tooth infection. They will decide what treatment is best for you. Sometimes they can clean the area to help it get better. Other times, they might need to remove a small part of the gum or even the whole tooth. You will get medicine to help with the infection and pain. It is important to follow the dentist's advice to keep your mouth clean and return for a check-up to make sure it heals properly."},{"prompt":"Given the question \\"Georgina is a ____________ woman wearing a yellow dress.\\" and the answer \\"small\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn.

Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

News article: Easy come, easy go — a new driver was forced to give up his license less than one hour after securing it, German police said Tuesday. A police speed trap detected a car going 95 kilometers per hour (59 mph) through the western town of Iserlohn, near Dortmund. The trouble is that the limit was just 50. When police pulled the vehicle over, they found an 18-year-old driver and four of his friends, apparently going for a spin to celebrate the teenager passing his driving test just 49 minutes previously. Read more: Naked cyclist caught by speed camera in Germany How to navigate the German autobahn The sky's the limit The only European country without a general speed limit on the most part of its highways, Germany has an excellent system of motorways. They are generally well-maintained, inviting you to explore them. The minimum age for obtaining a driver's license used with a legal guardian present in Germany is 17. An unrestricted car driver's license can be granted at age 18. How to navigate the German autobahn Bracing yourself According to statistics by ADAC, Germany's national automobile association, traffic jams increased by around 15 percent in 2016 as compared to the previous year. That's a lot for a relatively small country. The increase resulted from both more cars on the highway, and more construction sites. So brace yourself for more time and stress in the car, especially around big cities. How to navigate the German autobahn Tailgaters Even when think you're soaring down the autobahn, you may get the distinct impression it's still not fast enough. Some German drivers may drive right up behind you and try to \\"push\\" you over. They may even flash their headlights to rattle your nerves. You aren't supposed to block the \\"fast\\" lane — the aim being to only use it for passing. But don't let pushy drivers bully you! How to navigate the German autobahn Smile for the camera! Watch out for speed cameras! They are used widely in Germany, from the autobahn to inner city areas. These box-shaped devices are installed next to the road, and will often catch you unawares. Should you be driving over the speed limit, a ticket will be sent to your house, complete with a picture of you at the wheel and the license plate confirming your offense. How to navigate the German autobahn Cell phones a no-no Holding a cell phone in your hand while driving is an absolute no-no. If caught, you could be fined 100 euros (124) and get a one-point penalty against your driver's license. Penalties spike up if you cause an accident, and you may have your license revoked. Fines were raised in 2017. Investing in a hands-free car kit is smarter. Penalties also apply to bicyclists using their cell phones. How to navigate the German autobahn Make way for help The same thing goes for not making way for emergency vehicles. Once traffic jams up, you are required to create a lane for ambulances and police, even before you see the flashing lights behind you. If not, you could be fined at least 200 euros (around 250) and get points on your license. The emergency lane is always between the far left and the rest of the lanes. How to navigate the German autobahn Be on the alert You are also required to set up a warning signal should you break down or have an accident. This means placing an orange metal triangle on the road, donning a fluorescent jacket, both of which you must have in your car. You must also have a first-aid kit stored in your vehicle. How to navigate the German autobahn Driving under the influence In Germany, there's zero tolerance for beginners, as well as for professional drivers. There's a 0.5 percent blood alcohol content (BAC) limit to driving under the influence. Bicyclists may not exceed 1.6 percent. Penalties start at a €500 (623) fine, points off your license and even a one-month license suspension. Best bet: don't drink and drive!

In Germany, the rule of thumb is that this can occur anytime between October and Easter. Should you not have snow tires installed on your car and still drive on slippery streets, you could be fined and have points taken off your license. Without proper snow tires, your insurance may also not cover an accident. How to navigate the German autobahn A relaxed approach To navigate both the German autobahn and city streets, the best approach is a zen one: take your time and don't let yourself get frazzled. Besides, with an expansive train and public transportation system in the country, you might not even want to hop into your car, but board a train and put up your feet!

Not so fast, says France Slowing down on the way to the Riviera It started in 2015 when French officials chose three stretches of the Nationale 7 highway, the French vacation highway that leads to the Riviera, to test the new 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph) speed limit. On Sunday, all two-lane roads in France will now have lowered speeds from 90 kph (55 mph) to 80 kph. Pedal to the metal? Not so fast, says France No putting the brakes on an unpopular move \\"The goal is not to piss people off,\\" said French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. But he reiterated that he was ready \\"to live with being unpopular.\\" He noted that a similar reduction on the Paris ring road led to an 18 percent drop in accidents. Some local officials have vowed they won't put up the new speed limit signs even though the government has promised to reimburse them. Pedal to the metal? Not so fast, says France Germany: Even without a speed limit, you can't floor it In Germany, the speed limit on two-lane highways is 100 kph (60 mph) and on many stretches of highway there is no speed limit at all. But with crowded freeways, having no speed limit doesn't matter if you can't get enough room to cruise. Pedal to the metal? Not so fast, says France Saving money will take time The French government has been running radio and TV ads to quell drivers' anger by saying the new speed limits will only add a few minutes to most trips. The upside is that motorists' fuel costs will go down by €120 (140) year. The new speed limit in France matches those in Bosnia, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. Pedal to the metal? Not so fast, says France Not safe at any speed Sweden has the lowest number of road deaths at 2.6 per 100,000 and some of the toughest speed limits in Europe. Germany at 4.2, Great Britain at 2.8 and Ireland at 3.5 are some of the safest countries. The highest number of road deaths per 100,000 are in Romania (9.6) and Bulgaria (9.9). The high accident rates are attributed to poor roads and older, rundown cars.

The 18-year-old was returning from his successful driving test when officers in the town of Hemer checked his car with a laser speed gun. He was clocked travelling almost twice the speed limit - at 95km/h (60mph) in a 50km/h (30mph) zone. \\"Some things last for ever - others not for an hour,\\" German police wrote in their statement. The young man had four friends in the car with him, regional police in Märkischer Kreis said - and speculated that perhaps he was trying to impress with his driving skills. Instead, he now faces a hefty punishment. He has been formally banned for four weeks, but police said he would only get his licence back after \\"expensive retraining\\". He is also facing a €200 fine, two points on his licence once it is restored, and his probationary period as a new driver has been lengthened from two years to four.

He skipped rocks on a calm day when the lake was smooth and on a windy day when the lake was choppy. He noticed that the rock encountered less friction on the smooth lake than the choppy lake. Which lake would the rock skip farther on? (A) The smooth lake (B) The choppy lake Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"smooth lake\\" and \\"choppy lake\\". A:","completion":"The smooth lake would be the lake on which the rock would skip farther. This is because, as observed by Bob, there is less friction on the smooth lake as compared to the choppy lake. Friction plays a critical role in determining how far an object can travel. The less friction there is between the object and the surface it is moving on, the further it can go. In the case of skipping rocks, the friction that affects the motion of the rock comes from the interaction between the rock and the water. On a calm day, the surface of the water is relatively flat and smooth, leading to less friction between the water and the rock. When the rock is thrown, it can maintain its momentum for a longer distance as it experiences less resistance from the water. This allows the rock to skip more times and cover a greater distance before it eventually sinks. Conversely, on a windy day, the surface of the lake becomes choppy, with waves and turbulence present in the water. This leads to an increase in friction as the rock's motion is impeded by the rough water surface. As the rock is thrown, it encounters more resistance from the water, causing it to lose its momentum quicker. Consequently, it will skip fewer times and cover a shorter distance before sinking. Thus, due to the reduced friction on the smooth lake, the rock would skip farther on the smooth lake as compared to the choppy lake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It turns out to be the biggest mystery in modern aviation history. In the early hours of March 8, a Boeing 777 took off from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur . It was heading to Beijing. But about two hours into the flight, the plane lost contact. There were 239 people on board the Malaysia Airlines flight, including 154 Chinese. About 12 countries, including China, the US and Australia, have joined the search for the missing plane and passengers. The plane's disappearance was a \\"mystery\\", said officials. The plane was flying at a height of more than 10,000 meters when it suddenly lost contact. The weather was clear. The pilots didn't make any distress calls . When a plane crashes, broken parts are usually recovered. But up to April 2, officials have not found anything. People are also talking about a possible hijacking. Interpol said that two people on the flight used stolen passports. But that information alone isn't evidence of a hijack. The investigation is still going on. It could take months or even years to find out what happened to the flight. \\"We are looking at all possibilities,\\" said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein. \\"The most important thing now is to find the plane.\\" On March 24 came a piece of sad news. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that the plane \\"ended in the southern Indian Ocean\\". Everyone on the plane died. But the mystery is still not solved. Nobody is giving up.

Write some highlights for the following article: A man who helped break up an anti-gay assault at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last week found out just what it's like to be famous when video of his heroic deed went viral. The only problem is that many people thought that the man in question, Ben Kravit, a 28-year-old from Dallas, Texas, was actually actor Paul Rudd. That is until Rudd's publicist revealed it was not the actor in the video, and someone who knows Kravit revealed his identity to the website Jezebel, leading to what Kravit describes as a 'pretty crazy day.' Scroll down for video. Hero: Ben Kravit (above) broke up an anti-gay assault at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last Thursday. Mistaken identity: When a video of his heroic deed went viral, many started to believe it was Paul Rudd seen in a plaid shirt (above circled in red) breaking up the fight. No help: Kravit (above circled in red) has said workers at the airport and TSA agents were no help and seemed to do little to stop the fight from happening. Now, everyone wants to know more about Kravit, a brand manager who works for Dr. Pepper Snapple and is engaged to a woman who is no doubt the envy of many these past few days. It all began last Thursday when video surfaced of a man berating a fellow traveler at the airport for wearing a pink shirt. Then, when the anti-gay attacker was approached by someone in a cowboy hat asking what was wrong, he screamed, 'Queers! That’s what I’m upset about. This fa**ot right here.' Seconds later he started to kick the man in the pink shirt, while also grabbing his hair and slapping at him. That is when Kravit, the man in the cowboy hat and a few other model citizens stepped in to subdue the aggressor and stop the assault. The whole time, a passenger named Andrew Kennedy was filming the melee, which has now been viewed close to four million times on YouTube. It wasn't me: A publicist for Rudd (above) revealed on Monday that it was not the actor in the video. America's sweetheart: Kravit (above with his fiancee) is a 28-year-old brand manager for Dr. Pepper Snapple. Good sport: Said Kravit (above with his fiancee) of the experience, 'It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years' And that is when people watching the video started to wonder if Rudd, the star of films including Clueless, Anchorman and This Is 40 was responsible for taking down the homophobe. 'It seemed like every blog and website out there was running with it,' said Kravit. 'I have gotten the doppelgänger about [Rudd] before, but nothing like today. It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years.' As for why he jumped to action, the young man said, 'I know people can get agitated at airports, but the incendiary and ignorant comments he was making were out of control. I was really surprised no police or security was there to separate the two, but then when it got physical my instinct was to stop and protect the victim.' He added, 'It was really unfortunate that people think such discriminatory things, let alone verbally and physically assault someone over it. I'm glad I, along with the others who helped out, were there to help the victim and nothing worse came of it.' Paul Rudd would be proud. Highlights:","completion":"1.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sir George Henry Martin (3 January 1926 - 8 March 2016) was an English record producer, arranger, composer, conductor, audio engineer, and musician. He was referred to as the \\"Fifth Beatle\\", including by Paul McCartney, in reference to his extensive involvement on each of the Beatles' original albums. Martin produced 30 number-one hit singles in the United Kingdom and 23 number-one hits in the United States. Martin produced comedy and novelty records in the early 1950s, working with Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, and Bernard Cribbins, among others. Martin was born in Highbury, London. When he was six, Martin's family acquired a piano that sparked his interest in music. At eight years of age, Martin persuaded his parents, Henry and Betha Beatrice (nee Simpson) Martin, that he should take piano lessons, but those ended after only eight lessons because of a disagreement between his mother and the teacher. As a child, he attended several schools, including a \\"convent school in Holloway\\", St Joseph's School (Highgate), and at St Ignatius' College (Stamford Hill), where he had won a scholarship. When WWII broke out, and St. Ignatius College students were evacuated to Welwyn Garden City, his family left London, and he was enrolled at Bromley Grammar School. I remember well the very first time I heard a symphony orchestra. I was just in my teens when Sir Adrian Boult brought the BBC Symphony Orchestra to my school for a public concert. It was absolutely magical. Hearing such glorious sounds I found it difficult to connect them with ninety men and women blowing into brass and wooden instruments or scraping away at strings with horsehair bows. Despite Martin's continued interest in music, and \\"fantasies about being the next Rachmaninov\\", he did not initially choose music as a career. He worked briefly as a quantity surveyor, and later for the War Office as a Temporary Clerk (Grade Three), which meant filing paperwork and making tea. In 1943, when he was 17, he joined the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy and became an aerial observer and a commissioned officer. The war ended before Martin was involved in any combat, and he left the service in 1947. Encouraged by Sidney Harrison (a member of the Committee for the Promotion of New Music) Martin used his veteran's grant to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama from 1947 to 1950, where he studied piano and oboe, and was interested in the music of Rachmaninoff and Ravel, as well as Cole Porter. Martin's oboe teacher was Margaret Eliot (the mother of Jane Asher, who would later become involved with Paul McCartney). After that, Martin explained that he had just picked it up by himself. On 3 January 1948 - while still at the Academy - Martin married Sheena Chisholm, with whom he would have two children, Alexis and Gregory Paul Martin. He later married Judy Lockhart-Smith on 24 June 1966, and they also had two children, Lucie and Giles Martin. Which musicians did he like?","completion":"Sir George Martin had a wide range of musical tastes and interests, reflecting his diverse career and experiences as both a musician and a record producer. It's worth noting that his training and background were firmly rooted in classical music, and he had a strong appreciation for the great composers. As a student, he was known to have shown an interest in the music of Sergei Rachmaninoff and Maurice Ravel, two prominent figures in the late Romantic and early 20th-century classical music scene. Rachmaninoff was known for his lush, romantic melodies, while Ravel was known for his exquisite orchestrations and impressionistic harmonies. While studying at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, he was taught oboe by Margaret Eliot, a relationship hinting at a probable liking for classical orchestral music. His statement on hearing the BBC Symphony Orchestra, led by Sir Adrian Boult, perform at his school further reinforces his fondness for grand, orchestral compositions, underlining his appreciation for the symphony orchestra sound. In terms of 20th-century popular music, one musician he clearly had a keen interest in was Cole Porter, an American composer and songwriter known for his clever lyrics and sophisticated musical sensibilities. Porter was renowned for his works in the realm of musical theatre and was one of the major songwriters for the Broadway musical stage. However, of course, the group of musicians with whom Sir George Martin is most associated and was profoundly inspired by is The Beatles. He was instrumental in their development and was called the \\"Fifth Beatle\\" due to his extensive involvement in shaping their sound. His creative collaborations with The Beatles not only displays his appreciation for their work but also his love for innovation and experimentation in music. Beyond the Beatles, he worked with many other artists, covering a diverse range of genres, which suggests a flexible and eclectic musical taste. In sum, Sir George Martin's appreciation for music was wide and varied, manifesting a respect for the classical tradition as well as an adventurous spirit eager to embrace the new trends in modern music. His tastes, therefore, were quite comprehensive, covering everyone from classical composers like Rachmaninoff and Ravel, through Broadway genius Cole Porter, to Beatles band members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr amongst others. His diverse taste also extended to comedy and novelty records, working with artists like Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away.

The rate of death from any cause was 2 to 3 times as high among current smokers as among persons who never smoked, a finding that is consistent with the results in our previous report.3 Approximately 17% of this excess mortality was due to associations with causes that have not been formally established as attributable to smoking. The rate of death from renal failure was twice as high among current smokers as among persons who never smoked, a finding that is consistent with results from case–control studies.11,12 Smoking is an important cause of the cardiovascular risk factors for renal failure but may also directly impair kidney function.12 Even in patients without underlying renal or cardiovascular diseases, urinary albumin, a marker of potential renal damage, increases in a dose-dependent manner with the number of cigarettes smoked per day.13 Current smoking was associated with an increased risk of death from hypertensive heart disease (according to ICD-10 coding), which is the only category of heart disease not already formally established as attributable to smoking.1 Criteria for attributing a death from heart disease to hypertensive heart disease are not well defined.14 Hypertensive heart disease can include both hypertensive heart failure and other types of heart disease. However, this association is relevant for assessing the public health burden of smoking, since a considerable number of deaths in the United States are attributed to hypertensive heart disease.15 Mortality from intestinal ischemia was strongly associated with current smoking in this cohort, as it was in the Million Women Study.2 The relative risk was approximately 6 among current smokers and decreased with increasing number of years since quitting. To our knowledge, no other large studies have examined this association. Smoking acutely reduces blood flow to the intestines,16 and evidence suggests that smoking causes risk factors that can often lead to intestinal ischemia, including atherosclerosis, platelet aggregation, and congestive heart failure.17 Mortality from infections was more than twice as high among current smokers as among persons who never smoked, and the risk increased with smoking intensity and declined with increasing number of years since cessation. Previous studies have documented higher rates of many infectious diseases among smokers.18,19 The Surgeon General has concluded that cigarette smoke adversely affects immune function and may accelerate the progression of many infectious diseases.1 Current smoking was associated with more than double the risk of death from diseases included in the category of other digestive diseases (ICD-10 codes K00–K54, K56–K69, and K78–K93). The Surgeon General recently concluded that the evidence linking smoking to Crohn’s disease was suggestive but still insufficient.1 Moreover, smoking is an important modifiable risk factor for peptic ulcers20,21 and acute pancreatitis.22,23 Other diseases in this group include paralytic ileus and bowel obstructions, cholelithiasis, diverticulitis, and gastrointestinal hemorrhages. Although these diseases are not common causes of death, they account for millions of hospitalizations each year.24 There is broad agreement that cigarette smoking causes cancers at a minimum of 12 different sites.25,26 This study updates the relative risks of death from cancer at these sites in a contemporary population. We also found additional significant associations with death from breast cancer and from prostate cancer. The Surgeon General has not yet concluded that smoking causes breast cancer.1 We found that the risk of death increased significantly with smoking intensity and declined after cessation of smoking, findings that were similar to results from previous analyses of data from the individual cohorts that were pooled for the current analysis.27-30 Numerous studies have examined the relationship between smoking and breast cancer; however, confounding by alcohol use remains a concern. An analysis of the Million Women Study showed a 13% higher risk of fatal breast cancer among current smokers after adjustment for the number of drinks per week, but no association was observed among women who consumed fewer than three drinks per week.2 In our analysis, smoking remained significantly associated with death from breast cancer among women who were not current drinkers. However, associations between smoking and death from breast cancer may also be biased by differences in screening31 or treatment32 patterns among smokers, and information on these variables was not available in this study. Additional studies with detailed information on these factors may be useful in clarifying whether smoking is causally associated with death from breast cancer. Mortality from prostate cancer in this population was 43% higher among current smokers than among those who had never smoked, a finding that is consistent with most previous analyses of prostate-cancer mortality.33 The Surgeon General concluded that although there was insufficient evidence that smoking increases the incidence of prostate cancer, the available evidence suggested that current or recent smoking increases the risk of advanced-stage disease and of death from prostate cancer.1 Higher mortality from prostate cancer among smokers could be caused by delayed diagnosis owing to less intense medical surveillance or by a promoting effect of smoking on later stages of carcinogenesis and progression.34 This latter hypothesis is supported by analyses showing associations between smoking and both progression of prostate cancer35 and prostate-cancer–specific mortality among men with prostate cancer.36 Results from our analysis appear to be consistent with an influence of smoking on later stages of carcinogenesis, since we observed no increase in prostate-cancer mortality among men who had recently quit smoking. We found significantly higher mortality from liver cirrhosis among smokers than among persons who never smoked but did not observe a dose–response pattern with respect to smoking intensity or years since quitting. In a recent analysis of the Million Women Study, mortality from liver cirrhosis was increased by a factor of 3, a finding that was unchanged when the analysis was restricted to women who reported consuming fewer than three drinks per week.2 In our analysis, current smoking was significantly associated with death from liver cirrhosis even among persons who were not current drinkers, although the relative risk was lower in that subgroup than in the overall study population. This association may be confounded by past alcohol use, but it could plausibly be attributed, at least in part, to smoking. Future studies should focus on the risks associated with smoking among persons who have never drunk alcohol. Overall, associations between smoking and death from the 14 disease categories shown in Table 3 accounted for virtually all the excess mortality associated with smoking that was not already accounted for by diseases previously established as attributable to smoking. We think there is strong evidence for a causal association between smoking and at least 5 of these disease categories — infections, hypertensive heart disease, renal failure, intestinal ischemia, and other respiratory diseases. The associations with respiratory diseases and infections have strong biologic plausibility. Hypertensive heart disease, renal failure, and intestinal ischemia are related to poor vascular function, and the adverse effects of smoking on vascular function in general are well established.17 In addition to these five disease categories, smoking was associated with mortality from cancers of unknown primary site that was increased by a factor of nearly 3. No cancer that has not already been established as caused by smoking is likely to be as strongly associated with smoking as that. Therefore, the excess risk of death from these cancers is likely to have resulted from cancers already established as caused by smoking. The same holds true with respect to deaths from unknown causes. Since the great majority of deaths are from causes established as attributable to smoking, this category probably includes substantial numbers of deaths from known smoking-related diseases. Deaths from the five disease categories we consider likely to be causal combined with deaths from unknown cancers and unknown causes accounted for approximately 10% of the total excess mortality among smokers in this cohort, or about half of all the excess mortality not accounted for by diseases already established as caused by smoking. Our results suggest that the Surgeon General’s recent estimate of smoking-attributable mortality may have been an underestimate. The Surgeon General’s estimate, which took into account only the 21 diseases formally established as caused by smoking, was that approximately 437,000 deaths among adults are caused each year by active smoking (not including secondhand smoke). However, the Surgeon General’s report presents an alternative estimate of 556,000 deaths among adults on the basis of the excess mortality from all causes. The difference between these two estimates is nearly 120,000 deaths.1 If, as suggested by the results in our cohort, at least half of this difference is due to associations of smoking with diseases that are causal but are not yet formally established as such, then at least 60,000 additional deaths each year among U.S. men and women may be caused by cigarette smoking. The primary strength of this study is its large size, which enabled us to examine causes of death that are too rare to examine in smaller studies; nonetheless, these outcomes are responsible for a sizable number of smoking-related deaths. This analysis includes mortality data that are updated from our original report and thus provides more precise estimates of the contemporary risks of death associated with smoking. A notable limitation of this study is that most members of the study population were white, and on average, they were better educated than the general population. Another limitation is that the associations observed in this study could be confounded by differences between smokers and nonsmokers with respect to risk factors including diet, physical activity, and access to medical care. The potential for confounding varies depending on the specific mortality outcome. However, in an earlier study of smoking and mortality, adjustment for demographic and behavioral factors had a minimal effect on risk estimates.37 In conclusion, this comprehensive examination of cause-specific mortality in a large contemporary population identified associations between smoking and increased mortality from several diseases that are not currently established as caused by smoking. Although these associations should be investigated further, our results suggest that the number of persons in the United States who die each year as a result of smoking cigarettes may be substantially greater than currently estimated. ||||| The U.S. surgeon general says about 480,000 Americans die each year as a result of smoking. But a new analysis suggests the true figure may be closer to 575,000. The 21 causes of death that have been officially blamed on smoking accounted for 83% of the actual deaths among smokers who were tracked in a study published in Thursday’s edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. Additional diseases -- including breast cancer, prostate cancer, hypertensive heart disease and renal failure -- were responsible for most of the rest of the observed deaths. A very small number of deaths were due to things such as accidents and suicide, which have a more tenuous link to smoking. Researchers from the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute and elsewhere combined data from five large, ongoing health studies: the Nurses’ Health Study I, the Women’s Health Initiative, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the Cancer Prevention Study II and the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. The researchers included 954,029 men and women who were being tracked as of Jan. 1, 2000, and who had told interviewers about their smoking status. Between 2000 and 2011, 16,475 (19%) of the 88,616 smokers died, as did 108,253 (23%) of the 469,141 former smokers and 56,649 (14.3%) of the 396,272 people who had never smoked, according to the study. Smokers were more likely than nonsmokers to have died from one of the established smoking-related diseases, the researchers found. These included most kinds of heart disease; stroke; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; pneumonia, influenza and tuberculosis; atherosclerosis; aortic aneurysms and other arterial diseases; diabetes; acute myeloid leukemia; and cancers of the lung, pancreas, colon and rectum, kidney, liver, bladder, larynx, lip and oral cavity, stomach and esophagus. These diseases were responsible for the overwhelming majority of deaths among men and women who were still smoking at the end of their lives. But not all of them. Another 17% of deaths among female smokers and 15% of the deaths of male smokers were traced to other causes. In nearly every case, the diseases in this second group were more likely to kill current smokers than nonsmokers, according to the study. For instance, female smokers were 30% more likely to die of breast cancer than their non-smoking counterparts, and men who smoked were 40% more likely to die of prostate cancer than their non-smoking peers. Rare cancers were 60% more likely to kill men if they were smokers, the researchers found. The risk of death due to infections was more than twice as high for smokers than for nonsmokers. Ditto for hypertension, hypertensive renal disease and a range of digestive diseases. Smokers were 2.6 to 3.6 times more likely than nonsmokers to die of liver cirrhosis and 1.9 to 2.1 times more likely to die of kidney failure. Hypertensive heart disease, some kinds of respiratory diseases and ischemic disorders of the intestines were also more likely to kill smokers than nonsmokers, the study authors calculated. The more cigarettes a person smoked per day, the greater his or her risk of dying from infections, breast cancer or kidney failure. Among those who quit, the longer it had been since the last cigarette, the lower the risk of dying from infections or breast cancer, according to the report. The researchers laid out the biological mechanisms that could plausibly explain why some of these diseases would be more likely to kill smokers. In the case of infections, for example, cigarette smoke is known to hinder immune function. Smoking is also known to reduce blood flow to the intestines, potentially explaining the link to intestinal and digestive diseases. Compared to the U.S. population as a whole, the people included in this study were more likely to be white and to be highly educated. That limits researchers’ ability to generalize the findings to the entire country. Still, the study authors didn’t hesitate to say that the surgeon general should go back and check the math. “Our results suggest that the number of persons in the United States who die each year as a result of smoking cigarettes may be substantially greater than currently estimated,” they wrote.

Research has shown that their death rates are two to three times higher than those of people who have never smoked, and that on average, they die more than a decade before nonsmokers. Smokers are more than 20 times as likely as nonsmokers to die of lung cancer. Poor people and those with less formal education are the most likely to smoke. Mr. Carter said he had been inspired to dig deeper into the causes of death in smokers after taking an initial look at data from five large health surveys being conducted by other researchers. The participants were 421,378 men and 532,651 women 55 and older, including nearly 89,000 current smokers. As expected, death rates were higher among the smokers. But diseases known to be caused by tobacco accounted for only 83 percent of the excess deaths in people who smoked. Photo “I thought, ‘Wow, that’s really low,’ ” Mr. Carter said. “We have this huge cohort. Let’s get into the weeds, cast a wide net and see what is killing smokers that we don’t already know.” The research was paid for by the American Cancer Society, and Mr. Carter worked with scientists from four universities and the National Cancer Institute. The study was observational, meaning that it looked at people’s habits, like smoking, and noted statistical correlations between their behavior and their health. Correlation does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship, so this kind of research is not considered as strong as experiments in which participants are assigned at random to treatments or placebos and then compared. But people cannot ethically be instructed to smoke for a study, so a lot of the data on smoking’s effects on people comes from observational studies.

Analyzing deaths among the participants from 2000 to 2011, the researchers found that, compared with people who had never smoked, smokers were about twice as likely to die from infections, kidney disease, respiratory ailments not previously linked to tobacco, and hypertensive heart disease, in which high blood pressure leads to heart failure. Smokers were also six times more likely to die from a rare illness caused by insufficient blood flow to the intestines. Mr. Carter said he had confidence in the findings because, biologically, it made sense that those conditions were related to tobacco. Smoking can weaken the immune system, increasing the risk of infection, he said. It is also known to cause diabetes, high blood pressure and artery disease, all of which can lead to kidney problems. Artery disease can also choke off the blood supply to the intestines. Lung damage from smoke, combined with increased vulnerability to infection, can lead to multiple respiratory illnesses. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Two other observations supported the findings, he said. One was that the more heavily a person smoked, the greater the added risks. The second was that among former smokers, the risks diminished over time. In general, such effects, known as a dose response, suggest that an observed correlation is more than a coincidence. The study also found small increases in the risks of breast and prostate cancer among smokers. Mr. Carter said those findings were not as strong as the others, adding that additional research could help determine whether there were biological mechanisms that would support a connection. A 2014 report by the surgeon general’s office said the evidence for a causal connection between smoking and breast cancer was “suggestive but not sufficient.” The same report found no evidence that smoking caused prostate cancer, but it noted that in men who did have prostate cancer, smoking seemed to worsen the outcome. The diseases that had previously been established by the surgeon general as caused by smoking were cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, bladder, kidney, cervix, lip and oral cavity; acute myeloid leukemia; diabetes; heart disease; stroke; atherosclerosis; aortic aneurysm; other artery diseases; chronic lung disease; pneumonia; influenza; and tuberculosis. ||||| A new study suggests that smoking may be responsible for 60,000 to 120,000 more deaths in the U.S. each year than previously thought. The examination of 181,377 fatalities logged in five large databases found that many of the excess deaths among smokers were due to causes not previously linked to smoking, such as kidney failure, infections and possibly breast and prostate cancers. Until now, 21 common diseases have been associated with cigarette smoking, including diabetes, 12 cancers and six forms of cardiovascular disease. The new research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, may expand that list. \\"We were interested in whether smoking causes more than these diseases that are on the list. And we certainly did find some,\\" coauthor Eric Jacobs told Reuters Health. \\"The fact that about 17 percent of the extra deaths that occur in smokers were due to causes that were not on the Surgeon General's list was a bit of a surprise to me.\\" If the findings are applied nationwide, he said, the number of previously-unrecognized smoking-related deaths could be greater than the total number of Americans who die each year of influenza or liver disease. Until this study, about 480,000 U.S. deaths each year were believed to be attributable to cigarettes. The researchers also found that the elevated risks faded as smokers stayed off cigarettes. The findings derive from databases following nearly a million people over age 54 for about a decade. The researchers expected to see smokers dying faster than nonsmokers, and they did. But when they looked beyond conventional causes, they found that smoking doubled the risk of death from kidney failure and from various respiratory diseases. It also seemed to pose a six-fold risk of death from intestinal ischemia, where the intestine is damaged by reduced blood flow. The risk of death from infections was 2.3 times higher and the likelihood of death from cirrhosis of the liver was 3.1 times higher. Breast cancer deaths were 30 percent higher among the smokers. Prostate cancer death rates were elevated by 40 percent. In many cases, the more people smoked, the greater the risk. That wasn't seen in prostate cancer, \\"but the risk of death decreased significantly as the number of years since quitting smoking increased,\\" said Dr. Graham Colditz of the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, in an editorial. \\"It's not a surprise that smoking kills. We've known that for years,\\" said Jacobs, who is director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society. \\"But it's important for people to realize the full impact that smoking has in terms of the national deaths. So eliminating smoking needs to be a national priority.\\" In his editorial, Colditz points out that 18 percent of the U.S. population, 42 million Americans, smoke, and public health efforts to help them quit have not done enough to change “social norms.” In the U.S., smoking has become a habit of the poor and the poorly-educated, Colditz told Reuters Health. He said that \\"in 2013, a total of 29 percent of adults below the poverty line smoked, whereas 16 percent at or above the poverty level did. In addition, only 6 percent of adults with advanced college degrees smoked, whereas 41 percent of those with a general equivalency degree did.\\" Colditz writes in the editorial, “The Affordable Care Act provides expanded access to cessation support for many, but holes in Medicaid coverage in many states leave numerous smokers without as much evidence-based support as they need.” SOURCE: bit.ly/1xJnCqb New England Journal of Medicine, online February 11, 2015. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A new study suggests that smoking may be responsible for 60,000 to 120,000 more deaths in the U.S. each year than previously thought.

When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens...

As it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles. Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight. Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water, with larval adaptations that include gills, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming. Some species, such as water striders, are capable of walking on the surface of water. Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain bees, ants and termites, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies. Some insects, such as earwigs, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young. Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances. Other species communicate with sounds: crickets stridulate, or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males. Lampyridae in the beetle order Coleoptera communicate with light.

Summarize this article: A review of the college at Garverville, east Belfast, was ordered after 54 student officers were found to have cheated in their exams. It described the culture as \\"pseudo-militaristic\\", with \\"an unhealthy leaning towards punitive discipline\\". The PSNI accepted 50 recommended changes. Chief Constable George Hamilton and other members of the senior PSNI members will meet members of the Policing Board to discuss an implementation plan to address concerns raised. A number of changes to the 22-week training course were introduced immediately. These included the practice of students marching to and from classes and the use of military-style \\"show parades\\" as a form of discipline. Groups of students will in future be referred to as \\"classes\\", and not \\"squads\\". The PSNI plan sets out 34 changes it hopes to have implemented by the end of March next year. In a statement earlier this week, the Policing Board said the report's conclusion, that the pervading culture in the college was \\"not conducive to a safe and professional learning environment\\", was \\"a matter of most serious concern\\". A special meeting of the board was convened for Thursday to discuss the report's findings and the police response. All training at Garnerville has been suspended since the exam-cheating scandal was uncovered on 7 August. More than 200 new recruits have had their training delayed, and a planned recruitment drive was also put on hold while this review was completed. The Chief Constable has said several times in recent months that a failure to recruit new officers will have a serious impact on the operational capability of the PSNI. George Hamilton is expected to ask for the approval of the Policing Board to restart training at the college, and to proceed with a recruitment campaign in January.","completion":"A school for police officers in a place called Garverville had some problems because 54 students cheated on their tests.

Would \\"The languages spoken there reflect ancient settlement patterns, migrations, and its long history.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The languages spoken there reflect ancient settlement patterns, migrations, and its long history\\" would be a reasonable answer to the question about the language of Mali. However, it is essential to provide more specific information to offer a comprehensive perspective on the languages spoken in the country. Mali, a West African country, is linguistically diverse, with more than 40 languages spoken by various ethnic groups. The official language is French, which was inherited from the colonial period when Mali was a part of French Sudan. Nevertheless, French is not the first language for the majority of Malians and is predominantly employed in government, administration, education, and other formal sectors. Apart from French, Bambara (or Bamanankan) is the most widely spoken language in Mali, serving as the lingua franca in the country. Bambara belongs to the Mande group of the Niger-Congo language family and is the mother tongue for nearly 40% of the population, including the Bambara ethnic group. Most Malians can comprehend and communicate in Bambara, even if it is not their native language. In addition to French and Bambara, there are many other regional languages spoken in Mali. Some of these languages include Fulani (or Fula), Dogon, Songhai, Soninke, Tamasheq (the language of the Tuareg people), Bozo, and Bobo, among others. As mentioned in your statement, the linguistic diversity in Mali indeed reflects the settlement patterns, migrations, and its long and complex history. The country's government promotes multilingualism, as exemplified by the 'Project for the Promotion of Bilingual Education' implemented in 2006. This initiative encourages the use of local languages like Bambara, alongside French, in the education system to improve literacy rates and preserve the cultural heritage linked to these languages. In conclusion, while the official language of Mali is French, there are numerous indigenous languages spoken, with Bambara being the most prominent and widely understood. Mali's rich linguistic heritage reflects its historical developments, migrations, and various influences over the centuries. The government is taking steps to preserve this heritage and foster multilingualism in society, including education initiatives that combine French with local languages."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said. Paul Rosenzweig, an adjunct professor at the George Washington School of Law...

Jaso believes that the questions are not sharp enough and do not seem like typical questions a prosecutor would ask in an interview.

Solve 141*a - 2001 = -450 for a.","completion":"To solve for 'a' in the given equation 141*a - 2001 = -450, we need to isolate 'a'. We want to get 'a' by itself on one side of the equation. First, we add 2001 to both sides of the equation to undo the subtraction of 2001. The equation becomes: 141*a = -450 + 2001 Doing the addition on the right side yields: 141*a = 1551 Once we have that, we want to isolate 'a' on one side by itself, so we divide both sides by 141, since the 'a' on the left side is currently being multiplied by 141. a = 1551/141 Adding out the division gives us: a ≈ 11 So, the solution to the equation 141*a - 2001 = -450 for 'a' is approximately 11.

Question: What is the difference in appearance between an RLV disc and a regular LD? Is \\"The purplish color of RLVs is very similar to DVD-R and DVD+R discs.\\" the correct answer? Choose your answer from: - yes - no","completion":"No, the statement is not entirely correct. The difference in appearance between a Recordable Laser Videodisc (RLV) and a standard LaserDisc (LD) goes beyond color and involves more attributes. LaserDiscs and Recordable Laser Videodiscs, while similar in fundamental design, differ in many aspects, most notably their physical appearance. One of the first distinctions you might notice between an RLV and a regular LD is that RLVs have a more colorful appearance, often light purple or blue, due to the dye used in the disc's data layer. This dye is photosensitive and changes reflectivity when exposed to the recording laser's heat, allowing data to be written on the disc. Regular LDs, on the other hand, do not use this dye and usually have a silver or gold hue, derived from the aluminum used to create the reflective layer. In addition, because RLVs are a product of write-once technology, they have a wobbled pre-groove that regular LaserDiscs don't. This wobbled pre-groove is used in the data writing process. It's a slightly sinuous groove that guides the laser during recording, and it also carries some address information, telling the recording device where on the disc it is writing data. Moreover, there can be differences in the labeling. RLVs might have no label or a very simple label due to being typically recorded and labeled by the user, while manufactured LaserDiscs can contain complex, professionally printed label designs. However, the purplish color that the statement mentions does not hold for all RLVs, some might be blue or even give off a greenish hue. The disc dye remains a general indication, but for a quick visual identification, the wobbled pre-groove or the lack of professionally printed labels could be more reliable tell-tale signs. As a result, while color can be an indicator, it’s not the only distinguishing factor between RLV and LD discs. Factors such as the disc's grooving and the complexity of the label also play a vital role. Therefore, it would be incorrect to state that the purplish color is the sole distinguishing factor between RLV discs and regular LDs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Freedom was in the air and it was not just for people. The wall between East and West Germany had also kept a large population of wild pigs within the eastern forests of Brandenburg.The wall's falling down made it easier for the big pigs--a very big one can weigh over 300 pounds--to leave the woodlands and walk into the town. Warm winters and easy access to food have helped the population increase. Now about 10,000 wild pigs walk around Berlin. The nature of the beast has added to the boom .\\"The pigs are intelligent,\\" says Marc Franusch, a spokesman for the Berlin forestry department. \\"They learn to use the neighborhoods.They get used to people, dogs, and traffic.\\" The wild pigs tend to travel in small groups and have been found searching rubbish and gardens, feeding their piglets in the shadow of parked cars, and crossing busy roads.On average, the animals are involved in one traffic accident every day. And despite the fact that it's illegal, some Berliners have been known to give the pigs food. Though wild pigs are protected under German law, the city's forestry department is permitted to kill 2,000 of the creatures every year, targeting mostly young adult animals in forests surrounding Berlin. Pigs within city limits are only shot if they make an immediate threat.No humans have yet been seriously wounded by them, but local dogs have been the victims of their tusks. \\"The forestry department is not aiming to get rid of the pigs,\\" explains Franusch, \\"but we do have to reduce dangerous situations.\\" Question: The following factors contribute to the boom of wild pigs EXCEPT _ .

It will not cut medium tall or slick type grass or weeds. The good news is I kept my 1960's push mower. Because after I used the Scotts mower, I had to re-mow with the antique. I used the mower 3 times, but gave up. I am embarrassed to sell it, because it is a piece of junk. Will probably leave out on my lawn and hope someone steals it. Is the review positive or negative? A:","completion":"The review is clearly negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment with the purchase of the Scotts mower, noting that it failed to meet their basic expectation which is to cut medium tall or slick type grass or weeds. Their disappointment with the product was so intense that they had to revert to using their 1960's push mower, which implies that the new Scotts mower was less effective than their decades-old equipment. This marks quite a failure for a new-age product, hence such sentiment of discontent and dissatisfaction. The person also reveals that they've attempted to use the mower multiple times, possibly to give it a fair chance. However, each attempt resulted in disappointment which eventually led to them giving up on using the product altogether. Moreover, the reviewer goes on to express feeling of embarrassment about selling the product because they believe it to be a \\"piece of junk\\". This not only reinforces their negative sentiment towards the product but also provides further indication of their belief in the product's lack of value or quality. Finally, the reviewer indicates their intention to leave the mower on their lawn in hopes that someone might take it, suggesting they believe the mower holds so little value, their preferred method of disposal is to have it stolen. In conclusion, not only is this review negative, it could be seen as a stern warning against purchasing the product. The dissatisfaction experienced by the reviewer is profound, leading to them considering the product not just disappointing, but embarrassingly poor quality. Their negative experience has led them to the conclusion that the product is not even worth selling."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a report published a year before Rio is due to host the 2016 Olympic Games, Amnesty said police were decimating a significant part of a generation of poor, young, black men. According to statistics released by Amnesty, nearly 16% of the total homicides registered in the city in the last five years took place at the hands of on-duty police officers. In 2012 more than 50% of homicide victims were aged between 15 and 29, and 77% of them were black, the figures suggest. Amnesty also said that incidents of police killings were rarely investigated and those responsible did not often face justice. But the prosecutor's office in Rio de Janeiro state told BBC Brasil that 587 police officers were accused and brought to justice between 2010 and 2015. Atila Roque, director at Amnesty International Brazil, said the country's strategy to tackle its drugs and violence problem was \\"backfiring miserably and leaving behind a trail of suffering and devastation\\". The pressure group says military police across Rio de Janeiro have regularly used unnecessary and excessive force during security operations in the city's poor neighbourhoods. Maria de Fatima Silva's son was killed in a police raid in Rio's Pavao-Pavaozinho favela in April 2014. The case of Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira, a professional dancer, triggered clashes between the police and residents outraged by his death. It is still being investigated but Ms Silva fears his case will eventually get shelved, so she has started her own private investigation. She told BBC Brasil's Luis Kawaguti that witnesses were afraid to testify after allegedly being threatened. She said support from campaign groups had given her the courage to fight for justice for her son. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article discusses a report by Amnesty International alleging that police in Brazil, specifically Rio de Janeiro, have illegally killed many suspects. The report was released a year before the 2016 Olympic Games and highlighted that a substantial portion of a generation of ​​poor, young, black Brazilian men were decimated by police violence. The report presents worrying statistics such as, nearly 16% of the total homicides in Rio over the past five years were committed by on-duty police officers. The victims were primarily young, black males aged between 15 and 29, making up over 50-75% of the victims. Amnesty also pointed out that police killings in Brazil are rarely investigated, and those allegedly responsible do not often face justice. Despite the police's previous denial of being \\"trigger-happy\\", stating that they often act in self-defense against drug dealers, Amnesty's report indicates that the police have consistently used unnecessary and excessive force during security operations in poor Rio neighborhoods. However, the prosecutor's office in Rio contradicted this claim, stating that between 2010 and 2015, 587 police officers were accused and brought to justice. Regardless, the police killings and the high number of deaths, not only of suspects but also of police officers (114 in Rio alone in 2014), showcase a violent and dangerous environment. An example mentioned in the article is the death of professional dancer Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira during a police raid that sparked outrage and conflicts between police and residents. His mother, Maria de Fatima Silva, had to start her own investigation as she fears her son's case will remain unresolved due to threatened witnesses. This personifies the broader issue of police violence and lack of accountability in Brazil, as highlighted by Amnesty. Atila Roque, director at Amnesty International Brazil, argued that Brazil's strategy to deal with its drug and violence problem was not effective and was causing significant harm and devastation. Despite the grave situation, the article ends by noting that there has been no response from Brazil's military police."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Spring is the time of the year most species reproduce.","completion":"In both sentences, the word \\"spring\\" refers to a season, specifically the season between winter and summer. However, the meaning and context in which \\"spring\\" is used differ slightly between the two sentences. Let's analyze each sentence separately to understand the subtle differences. 1. The emerging buds were a sure sign of spring. In this sentence, \\"spring\\" is used as a symbol or indicator of the renewal of life that takes place during this season. The focus here is on the buds emerging on trees or plants, which is a common occurrence during the spring season. This is a time when nature comes back to life after the dormancy of winter, and the buds are a visual representation or \\"sure sign\\" of that transformation. Essentially, \\"spring\\" serves as an emblem of new life, growth, and rejuvenation in this context. 2. Spring is the time of the year most species reproduce. In this sentence, \\"spring\\" is used to describe a specific period during the year when reproduction among various species is at its peak. This statement highlights the fact that spring is a vital time for many species to mate and reproduce, as the warmer weather, increased daylight, and abundant food sources create favorable environmental conditions for raising offspring. So, in this context, \\"spring\\" represents a crucial phase in the annual life cycle of many species rather than a symbol of renewal or rebirth. To sum up, in both sentences, \\"spring\\" refers to the transitional season between winter and summer, characterized by warmer weather, longer days, and blossoming vegetation. However, the first sentence emphasizes the symbolism of rebirth and rejuvenation associated with spring, while the second sentence focuses on the biological and ecological significance of this season in terms of reproduction for various species. While both sentences share the overarching theme of spring as a time of growth and renewal, there are subtle differences in their contextual implications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dane Laffrey on His Set for ‘American Hero’ “Sartre walks into a Quiznos” sounds like the setup to a glum philosopher’s sorry joke. But it’s actually the inspiration behind the set design for “American Hero,” a new comedy by Bess Wohl that takes place inside a failing, faux-cheery corporate sandwich shop in Anywhere, U.S.A. The store has no name and the script doesn’t specify a city or state. (In his review, Charles Isherwood of The New York Times said the set “has a generic perky colorfulness that’s just right.”) Other than a reference to a mall, it’s unclear where the place even is. So the set designer, Dane Laffrey, looked to Quiznos and other fast-food restaurants for décor that was “bright and punchy and primary colored,” yet also “bleak and monumentally ugly.” The result is pure Twilight Zone: a naturalistic set that’s as in tune with the play’s existential questions as it is about the assembly of triple bacon torpedo subs. “The set is a bit of a character in the sense that it’s this faceless but highly specific, big corporatist force that the characters are forced to confront and reckon with,” said Mr. Laffrey. Following is an annotated look at some of the elements that went into Mr. Laffrey’s design. “American Hero” is at Second Stage Theater’s uptown space through June 15. The front door area is made of plexiglass, some of which is tinted black. The wall outside suggests the store is isolated from its surroundings. “I think we’re in some kind of backwater, weird strip mall that may be the last place on earth,” Mr. Laffrey said. The light-box menus are by the company Enhance a Colour. There are no prices or calorie counts, which could connote place and era, something Ms. Wohl wanted to avoid. “You don’t want people going, ‘I wonder why that sandwich is 7.95?’ ” Mr. Laffrey said. Mr. Laffrey studied the Quiznos franchise handbook to learn how the company uses words in its décor. The red wall is covered in suggestive words like “flavor” and “mmmm,” but, in line with Ms. Wohl’s script, also the strangely philosophical phrase “Who are we?” The counters were custom designed by D&D Productions, a builder of theatrical sets in the Bronx, to look “Quiznosian,” Mr. Laffrey said. The countertop includes polyethylene cutting boards that would be standard in any sandwich shop, although the sneeze guard “is not quite regulation. The prop mistress, Susan Barras, procured craft foam and plastic versions of meatballs and a mound of guacamole. “Cheese” is portioned between paper to look like slices. Real food is used in a scene where the employees race to make sandwiches. The working soda machine, donated by Pepsi, delivers regular Pepsi (even though it comes from the Diet Pepsi dispenser). There is no ice maker, since it makes too much noise, but the machine itself isn’t so quiet. “It occasionally repressurizes itself, which we’re going to embrace,” Mr. Laffrey said. An earlier version of a subheading with this article misstated the given name of the set designer of the play “American Hero.” He is Dane Laffrey, not Dean. A version of this article appears in print on May 29, 2014, on page C5 of the New York edition with the headline: Good Enough to See, Maybe Not to Eat.

He also guaranteed America would finally learn just how disgusting, vile and despicable the left is in this country. And how major news outlets and one of the most well-known businesses in the world – Google – are complicit in trying to destroy Santorum because he opposes gay marriage. Santorum is the victim of what Reuters partner The Wrap and many other organizations call a “Google problem.” That’s quite the understatement. He was attacked with a Google bomb from Dan Savage, a gay advocate and sex columnist who hates straight people who don’t agree with him. He also thinks they should be silenced, bullied and blackmailed. That’s exactly how he’s treated Santorum. Savage, in an attempt to destroy Santorum on the Internet for all time, held a contest in 2003 and asked readers for the most foul thing they could say to create a new definition for “Santorum.” The dictionary calls that a neologism and readers gave him 3,000 suggestions. In practice, what Savage has done is the lowest form of hate speech. What he picked as a winner is so vile you don’t want to read it or see it or hear it. But you have to. It’s the top Google search term for Santorum, thanks to an extensive lefty campaign to discredit opponents of gay marriage. To ignore it is to ignore a major issue that is impacting the presidential campaign. It’s like hiding your eyes in the face of danger. Savage has been trying to destroy Santorum and Google is helping him do it by refusing to adjust the search. The result leads to the website spreadingSantorum.com, Savage has the following foul definition: \\"santorum (san-TOR-um) n. 1. The frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex.\\" That 16 word definition says more about the left, Google and the major media than any other words ever written. First, Google, the most dominant search engine on the planet, is a super tech company worth about 215 billion. Just one share of Google goes for roughly 666. (Yes, it really does.) One of the company’s guidelines is “You can make money without doing evil.” You can. They don’t. Google famously has a complex algorithm set up to search sites and determine what the most popular hit is for everything. So Santorum contacted Google and asked for their help. They gave him the back of their hand and refused to do anything. In repsonse to questions from left-leaning Politico, a Google “spokesperson said that Google does not ‘remove content from our search results, except in very limited cases such as illegal content and violations of our webmaster guidelines.’” In other words, they do it whenever they feel like. “I suspect if something was up there like that about Joe Biden, they’d get rid of it,” Santorum told Politico. “If you're a responsible business, you don't let things like that happen in your business that have an impact on the country.” The link to the foul Santorum page is there, but no explanation, apology, nothing. However, when a hate site showed up prominently as readers searched for “Jew,” Google was quick to respond by adding a disclaimer. That reads in part: “If you recently used Google to search for the word ‘Jew,’ you may have seen results that were very disturbing. We assure you that the views expressed by the sites in your results are not in any way endorsed by Google.” And Google, which won’t reveal how it does its search, is always being manipulated as techies try to figure out how best to play the Google game. To them, this is just someone playing that game. But Google isn’t alone in aiding the attack on Santorum. ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN have all given cover to Savage’s monstrous activities. ABC has been the worst, with “Nightline” doing a nearly six-minute puff piece Correspondent Yunji de Nies said of Savage “he’s not always nice.” That’s about as understated as saying de Nies isn’t always a good journalist. In her piece, she mentioned how “Savage doesn’t hide his politics” and that “he famously went after Republican Rick Santorum.” But she lacked the courage to explain what Savage did in detail. That would have damaged Savage’s credibility as an anti-bullying advocate. That’s right. Much of her piece, and news stories at other outlets, focused on how Savage and his male “partner” have led the “It Gets Better” campaign to discourage bullying of “lesbian, gay, bi, trans and other bullied teens.” Celebrities and even President Obama have done videos for the project. None of the reports noted that Savage, who says he was bullied when he was young, has turned into the personification of what he claims to hate. In other words, the anti-bullying advocate so hailed by the media is also a hypocrite. He disagrees with the very pledge he claims to support, that “everyone deserves to be respected for who they are.” Everyone, that is, except Rick Santorum or anyone else who opposes Savage’s gay agenda. But he remains a media darling. The New York Times magazine devoted more than 5,000 words in June to depicting Savage as “old fashioned” and saying, “Savage’s sex advice puts me in mind of a smart, tough old grandmother, randy yet stern.” His fellow lefties embrace Savage, impressed at how witty he is when he tells HBO’s Bill Maher that he wishes Republicans “were all f--king dead.” Or how he thinks “about f--king the s--t out of Rick Santorum.” Maher’s crowd laughed and applauded at that. And they think his defining attack on Santorum hilarious, even when he resorts to open blackmail. “Saturday Night Live” and Jon Stewart’s “Daily Show” have both made subtle jokes about the attack. Savage told Mother Jones that he might take down the Internet campaign against Santorum for enough cash. “If Rick Santorum wants to make a 5 million donation to [the gay marriage group] Freedom to Marry, I will take it down. Interest starts accruing now.” And Mother Jones' Stephanie Mencimer had to add a joke. “Santorum may want to consider Savage's offer. Otherwise, he's kinda screwed.” This putrid attack isn’t the defining battle of the 2012 election, but it does show you where different organizations stand. If Google continues to allow it, it shows it can’t be trusted with the massive power it has achieved. And no network that embraces Savage as a commentator or promotes his hypocritical charity can be taken seriously. It’s awful to see bullying – especially when news outlets and Google lend a hand.

Summarize: The trailer, shown to thousands of fans at the Star Wars Celebration event in London, ends with a shot of Vader and his trademark heavy breathing. Director Gareth Edwards revealed James Earl Jones, who voiced Vader in the original trilogy, will be back in the new film. The veteran actor recorded his dialogue in New York last December. Edwards said recording the dialogue had been \\"like an early Christmas present\\". He described how he and his sound recordist had a \\"nerd-gasm\\" when they heard Jones say the word \\"power\\" in his deep, distinctive voice. \\"We said, 'that's great - let's do that one more time.'\\" The poster for the film shows a beach battle taking place on the planet Scarif - with the Death Star looming in the sky. Rogue One tells the story of a group of rebel fighters on a mission to steal the plans for the Death Star. The film, out in December, is the first in a series of on-screen adventures exploring stories outside the core Star Wars saga. It is set before the first part of the original series, Episode IV: A New Hope. Vader's appearance had been rumoured for some time, but Lucasfilm only confirmed the Sith Lord's inclusion last month, giving no more details. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said Rogue One was going to be an \\"incredibly immersive experience\\". Edwards also introduced behind-the-scenes footage from the film during the Rogue One panel at the ExCel exhibition centre. The reel ended with British actress Felicity Jones, who plays Jyn Erso, saying: \\"May the Force be with us.\\" Jones was joined on stage by a number of cast members including Riz Ahmed, Forest Whitaker, Mads Mikkelsen and Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn, who plays villain Director Krennick, had arrived in costume - flanked by stormtroopers. He described his character as a \\"smarter villain than most of his predecessors\\". The panel began with the host Gwendoline Christie, who played Captain Phasma in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, making reference to Thursday's terror attack in Nice. \\"Our hearts go out to people in Nice and in France,\\" she said. Earlier in the day, Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill said new Star Wars film Episode VIII contained \\"so many great catchphrases\\".

This inconsistency creates an uncomfortable feeling that can lead them to avoid or disapprove of opinions that contradict their own in an effort to maintain a sense of harmony. In this case, they may view the person with a differing opinion as \\"evil\\" or wrong because it's easier to discredit the individual rather than confront the discrepancies between their beliefs. Theory 3: Tribalism and Social Identity Another potential explanation for the difficulty in accepting differing opinions is rooted in the human tendency to exhibit tribalism or engage in group-based thinking. People often have a strong sense of social identity, which can influence their opinions and how they perceive others' opinions. When an individual is strongly attached to a particular group or ideology, they may become defensive of their beliefs and view alternative opinions as an attack on their identity. As a result, this may cause them to label the person with an opposing view as \\"evil\\" to reinforce their commitment to their group or ideology. In conclusion, while it is important to consider these theories in understanding why people may have a hard time accepting different opinions, the key is to promote open dialogue and encourage critical thinking to better deal with differing views. By fostering understanding and empathy, we can create an environment where disagreements can be discussed in a constructive and respectful manner, reducing the likelihood of labeling others as \\"evil\\" or ignoring their opinions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"Aubrey had moved away a few years before and missed their friend Kai, because they wanted to spend time together. Life can often take people down different paths, but the relationships we forge along the way can hold a special place in our hearts. When Aubrey relocated, it was likely due to reasons that were important at the time; it could have been a job opportunity, education, or a family situation that prompted the move. Whatever the reason was, leaving familiar surroundings and close friends behind is never easy. Over time, despite being physically separated, Aubrey and Kai remained close friends, and their bond continued to endure the test of distance. While the initial pull may not have been the desire to spend quality time together, the consequences of the decision led to a stronger appreciation for the moments they did get to share. The longing to return to the comfort of familiarity and cherished friendships can weigh heavily on a person's mind. As months and years passed, Aubrey found themselves missing Kai more and more, and the desire to spend time together grew stronger. They realized that the experiences they shared and the memories they created were an irreplaceable part of their lives. The importance of maintaining their friendship likely became a priority for both of them, leading to more frequent communications, check-ins, and the desire to reunite. While the reasons for their initial paths diverging could vary, Aubrey's longing to return to the past and reconnect with Kai is testament to the strength of their friendship. Beyond life circumstances and geographic distance, it is the love and care we hold for our closest friends that can continue to bind us, no matter where our journeys take us. So, even though the answer options given were intended to highlight possible motivations, the complexity of life's decisions is often layered. And in the case of Aubrey and Kai, the desire to spend time together and rekindle their bond grew from the changes and distance life imposed on them."},{"prompt":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: What to do for low lymphocyte count Suggested answer: Under the microscope , lymphocytes can be divided into large lymphocytes and small lymphocytes.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Advertising - Coca-Cola TV Ads To Begin - NYTimes.com YESTERDAY, 2,000 Coca-Cola bottlers were in Atlanta to see the new advertising from McCann-Erickson that goes with the previously announced new theme line, ''Coke is it.'' Tonight, the client and agency estimate, 95 million Americans will see the first of the television commercials that have engaged the talents of scores of amateurs and professionals for more than a year. That's if you consider all of the painstaking consumer research to insure that Coke would receive advertising worth sinking more than 40 million into. And that sum does not include the money bottlers will be spending. All three networks will be carrying a spot at 9:15 P.M. That's called ''roadblocking,'' or no escape. Altogether, the agency shot eight 60-second and 30-second commercals in Houston, Santa Paula, Calif., Los Angeles, Dallas and at Grambling State University in Louisiana. The finished products have John F. Bergin, a convert from the Pepsi creative team who is now worldwide director of the Coke account at the agency, bubbling with enthusiasm. And at a preview, attended by Sergio Zyman, vice president for marketing operations of Coca-Cola U.S.A., Mr. Bergin talked excitedly about the new line, the music that goes with it and the ''unabashed product presence'' in the commercials. ''The music is a piece of dynamite,'' the copywriter said. ''It's like a football fight song. Usually you get a languid ballad. We were looking for a big, bold sound, and a big, bold statement. This isn't an ipsy-pipsy drink and the music says that loud and clear.'' The music was composed by Ginny Redington and arranged by her husband, Tom Dawes. It was one of 18 pieces submitted by outside music suppliers that were presented to the client along with 36 proposed lines that were candidates to replace the old line, ''Have a Coke and a Smile.'' This collection was narrowed to five lines and six musical pieces. Then the lines were typed separately and shown to consumers who were asked what they meant to them. Then each line was attached to an old bit of advertising art work and the question asked again. And then each of the lines and each of the pieces of music were added to different bits of old commercial footage and retested, but this time in group sessions. Gallup & Robinson, the research company, followed up with day-after recall tests. There was also what Mr. Bergin called a test for ''the quality of communication.'' On top of all that there were 200 one-on-one consumer interviews that went on for two hours or more. All this, said Mr. Bergin, whose other title is president, McCann-Erickson U.S.A., led to the final decision on ''Coke is it.'' Mr. Bergin said that those three little words reflect ''the product and w hat it is in the eyes of the consumer, t he mood of the company, aggressive management and bottlers,'' adding, ''The total marketing concept, a state of mind.'' Later, he said: ''It means something only as we shape it to mean something. Big taste. Refreshment.'' And that is worth reflecting on. Coke has spent millions of dollars over the years imprinting the image of its bottle in our minds. With the bottle and logo having insinuated itself into every corner of American life, all that the company has to do for it to benefit is find the key phrase with the right art and music. Coca-Cola, which spent 184.2 million for advertising all of its products in 1980, sank 37 million behind Coke itself, a drop of 11 percent from the previous year, according to Leading National Advertisers. That figure includes all major measured media execept newspaper and spot radio.","completion":"Coca-Cola has unveiled its new advertising theme line \\"Coke is it,\\" which was created by McCann-Erickson. Coca-Cola is expected to invest over 40 million in the campaign, excluding any additional spending by its bottlers.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Q: Question: What is the age difference between the royal architect and the person he worked for? Passage 1:Field Marshal Richard Molesworth, 3rd Viscount Molesworth, PC (1680 – 12 October 1758), styled The Honourable Richard Molesworth from 1716 to 1726, was an Anglo-Irish military officer, politician and nobleman. He served with his regiment at the Battle of Blenheim before being appointed aide-de-camp to the Duke of Marlborough during the War of the Spanish Succession. During the Battle of Ramillies Molesworth offered Marlborough his own horse after Marlborough fell from the saddle. Molesworth then recovered his commander's charger and slipped away: by these actions he saved Marlborough's life. Molesworth went on Lieutenant of the Ordnance in Ireland and was wounded at the Battle of Preston during the Jacobite rising of 1715 before becoming Master-General of the Ordnance in Ireland and then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Irish Army. Passage 2:Hans van Steenwinckel, the royal architect, designed and built the original pavilion and parterre garden in 1587, for King Frederick II of Denmark. The royal estate was then purchased in 1758 by Count Adam Gottlob Moltke, who completely changed the original pavilion and garden with the help of French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin between 1759 and 1763. The additions led to its present-day architectural structure and façade. Jardin also redesigned the original parterre gardens, changing them to a larger, more modern garden à la française design, with symmetrical hedges, avenues, fountains and mirror ponds. Within the castle wall boundaries, these elegant garden grounds remain to a large extent intact, but outside, much of the garden has been lost, including the most renowned romantic landscape garden in Denmark, designed by Johan Ludvig Mansa in the 1790s. This was mostly due to the sale of much of the original property by the Helsingør municipality which had purchased the entire Marienlyst estate at auction in 1851. One of the lot purchasers was J.S. Nathanson, who in 1859 built Hotel Marienlyst, the first luxury hotel in Helsingør, named after the castle. Passage 3:The Queen's Fool by Philippa Gregory is a 2004 historical fiction novel. Set between 1548 and 1558, it is part of Philippa Gregory's Tudor series. The series includes The Boleyn Inheritance. The novel chronicles the changing fortunes of Mary I of England and her half-sister Elizabeth through the eyes of the fictional Hannah Green, a Marrano girl escaping to England from Spain where her mother was burned at the stake for being Jewish. Hannah is discovered by Robert Dudley and John Dee and subsequently begged as a fool to Edward VI. She witnesses and becomes caught up the intrigues of the young king's court, and later those of his sisters. As Mary, Elizabeth, and Robert Dudley use Hannah to gather information on their rivals and further their own aims, the novel can plausibly present each side in the complex story. The Queen's Fool follows Hannah from ages fourteen to nineteen, and her coming-of-age is interspersed among the historical narrative (see Bildungsroman). The book reached # 29 on the New York Times Best Seller list and had sold 165,000 copies within three weeks of its release. A:","completion":"2"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After dropping out of high school in the tenth grade, he supported himself primarily by selling drugs before founding Ruthless Records and becoming a rapper. Arabian Prince, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube formed N.W.A. N.W.A's original lineup consisted of Arabian Prince, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube. DJ Yella and MC Ren joined later. The compilation album N.W.A. and the Posse was released on November 6, 1987, and would go on to be certified Gold in the United States. The album featured material previously released as singles on the Macola Records label, which was responsible for distributing the releases by N.W.A and other artists like the Fila Fresh Crew, a West Coast rap group originally based in Dallas, Texas. Eazy-E's debut album, Eazy-Duz-It, was released on September 16, 1988, and featured twelve tracks. It was labeled as West Coast hip hop, Gangsta rap, and Golden age hip hop.

The album was produced by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella and largely written by MC Ren, Ice Cube, and The D.O.C.. Both Glen Boyd from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and MTV's Jon Wiederhorn claimed that Eazy-Duz-It \\"paved the way\\" for N.W.A's most controversial album, Straight Outta Compton. Wright's only solo in the album was a remix of the song \\"8 Ball\\", which originally appeared on N.W.A. and the Posse. The album featured Wright's writing and performing; he performed on seven songs and helped write four songs. After the release of Straight Outta Compton, Ice Cube left because of internal disputes, and the group continued as a four-piece ensemble.

Article: Since the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social anthropology in Great Britain and cultural anthropology in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons, long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism.

The enigmatic and powerful leader, Chancellor Venix, has decreed that in order to maintain stability, every year, three individuals from each of the ten districts must be offered as sacrifices to the Sentinels, mysterious beings that possess the power to ensure humanity's safety. For years, the age of sacrifice was limited to individuals 25 years and older. People lived in fear, struggling to reach the age of 26, as this would guarantee their safety from the heinous eugenics program. Society stagnated, leaving people desperate and hopeless. Many fled to the outskirts of the great metropolis, trying to escape the Chancellor's tyrannical rule, but those who attempted the escape were rarely heard from again. However, a new dawn arose when Chancellor Venix decided to change the rules: the required age of sacrifice was lowered to eighteen. This decision wasn't met without resistance from the citizens. Protests sparked out on the streets, but the ever-watching and oppressive authority clamped down on the demonstrators, driving it underground. In this dark and chaotic world, we follow the story of 17-year-old Leila, a fierce and intelligent girl who works as an engineer at one of the government's Sentinel research facilities. As her 18th birthday approaches, she realizes that even her prestigious position would not protect her from the cruel fate of becoming a sacrifice. Not willing to accept her destiny, Leila sets out on a journey to find her long-lost brother who fled to the outskirts and is presumed dead. Together with her childhood friend Ethan, they defy the government's watchful eyes and unravel the mysteries behind the Sentinels and the origins of humanity's deal with these enigmatic beings. Along their journey, they encounter a rebellious group of survivors – those who managed to escape the clutches of the Chancellor and now live on the fringes of society. With their support, Leila and Ethan discover a shocking secret: the Sentinels are not what they seem, and the sacrifices might be more than merely offerings to ensure humanity's survival. As they delve deeper into the truth, Leila and Ethan realize that it's not only their lives at stake but the fate of the entire human race.

The picture is from her daughter and it reads \\"we love you mommy\\". Who does something like that ? What the eff?

He is trying to get his affairs in order and find a new master for his dog. Alexander saves a six- or seven-year-old boy who is a vagrant window washer from a band of policemen who are chasing down similar boys. He pays a visit to his thirtyish daughter (Iris Chatziantoniou), and musing on his likely dead wife, Anna (Isabelle Renauld), who appears as almost the same age as their daughter. At his daughterâs apartment, he does not tell her of his diagnosis, instead hands her letters written by his wife, her mother. She reads them. He learns that his daughter and her lover have sold his apartment for demolition without telling him. The boy is trying to leave Greece but the way to Albania is not exactly an easy one, Alexander sees at the snowy mountain border an eerie barbed wire fence with what seem to be bodies stuck to it. As the pair wait for the gate to open, they have a change of mind about crossing, when the boy admits has been lying about his life in Albania. The two of them barely escape a border sentry who chases them and make it back to Alexander's automobile. The boyâs perilous existence brings Alexander out of his stupor and self-pity, and seemingly re-energizes him in his love for a dead 19th century Greek poet, Dionysios Solomos (Fabrizio Bentivoglio), whose poem he longs to finish. The old poet and the boy are connected by fear. The former over what lies ahead, and if his life has had impact, and the latter over what lies ahead in his â especially a perilous return trip to Albania where, as he explains to Alexander, the path over the mountains is lined with land mines, as well as men who kidnap street boys to sell them for black market adopters (as well as possibly the sex trade).

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.

Article: Warning: reading too much Cinderella to your daughter may damage her emotional health in later life. A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. \\"They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,\\" she said.\\" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners.\\" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. \\"The question,\\" said Ms Darker Smith, \\"is why she did not break the door down herself.\\" Question: Cinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast are similar in that _ .

Some people affectionately refer to it as a \\"Bacon butty,\\" rendering a more casual and cozy image to this food item. The term \\"bacon sarnie\\" is another label for this sandwich, with ‘sarnie’ being a typical slang term for a sandwich in British English. Other names include \\"rasher sandwich,\\" which might derive from the use of bacon rashers in the sandwich. \\"Bacon sanger\\" is another common name, with 'sanger' indicating its sandwich form. The ‘piece ‘n bacon’ name offers an interesting play on the plainness yet wholesomeness of the dish, signifying a piece of bread coupled with bacon. Additional regional nomenclatures for the bacon sandwich are \\"bacon cob,\\" \\"bacon barm,\\" and \\"bacon muffin.\\" These names are rich in local dialect and nuances, where 'cob' is a term used for a roll in the Midlands, 'barm' is a term for a small, flat, round individual loaf or roll of bread in Northern England, and a 'muffin' refers to a type of bread roll enjoyed in parts of the United Kingdom.

USS Sawfish","completion":"Task: Constructing a movie plot surrounding a ship named \\"USS Sawfish\\" leaving Australian waters. Step 1: Conceptualization: Firstly, I think it's necessary to conceptualize the core elements surrounding the given plot information. The USS Sawfish is a US navy submarine, which adds a military aspect. The setting is Australian waters, which could suggest something related to international relations or a mission set in Australia. Given these points, I will lean towards a suspenseful and dramatic plot possibly tying in elements of action and adventure. Step 2: Building the Underlay: Defining major characters, their roles, and setting the general direction of the plot. Title: \\"Operation Abyss\\" Set in the year 2025, the USS Sawfish, one of the most technologically advanced submarines of the U.S. Navy, is sent on a classified mission in Australian waters. Captain John \\"Hawkeye\\" McCoy, a seasoned veteran with an unparalleled service record, is at the helm, leading a handpicked crew. Their mandate is cargo inspection but a high level of secrecy hints that there's more than what meets the eye. Step 3: Deepening the Plot: Introducing the predicament and the problem that the characters must overcome. On reaching the targeted coordinates, they locate the ship they are supposed to inspect – a mysterious freighter that's been linked to a series of nuclear weapons smuggling incidents. While the team prepares for inspection, an unexpected attack heavily damages the USS Sawfish leaving the crew stranded at the bottom of the Coral Sea and the enemy freighter escapes. Step 4: Fleshing out the Main Events: These are the main events which steer the rest of the movie forward. Now, the crew is struck with two critical problems. They must repair their only way home before the depleting oxygen supply runs out and relentless and unseen enemies threaten their survival. As the problems intensify they discover subterfuge within their ranks, their mission has been compromised due to a mole. Step 5: Climax and resolution: The climax is the turning point where the suspense or action reaches its peak and the problem is resolved. Despite dwindling hope and escalating mistrust among the crew, Captain McCoy’s leadership and strategic brilliance come to the forefront. Utilizing the few resources available, they withstand the challenges of the deep and eliminate the traitor within. In a tension-filled climax, they manage to survive, repair the submarine, and return to the surface. Their resurfacing is received by a fleet of allied forces. They not only survive the ordeal but provide vital info leading to the capture of the nuclear weapons-carrying freighter, thus preventing a possible major diplomatic catastrophe. With such a plot, we establish a thrilling naval story, filled with suspense, action, heroism, and conspiracy, penned within the overarching theme of the USS Sawfish leaving Australian waters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust - The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is: 1. Expose the iron surface to water and air (moisture and oxygen) Here's the complete process with steps and justification: 1. Expose the iron surface to water and air (moisture and oxygen) - This step is necessary because the presence of water and oxygen initiates the rust process. Water acts as an electrolyte, allowing chemical reactions to occur, and oxygen from the air is a key component in the formation of iron oxide. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - The formation of carbonic acid is essential for the process as it helps to lower the pH of the solution, thus accelerating the process of rusting. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - In an acidic environment, the iron atoms would dissolve more readily, forming iron ions. This step is critical for the progression of the rusting process, as it allows the necessary components to be available to form rust. 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The breakdown of water into its components provides the necessary source of oxygen as well as hydrogen gas, which is needed for the oxidation of the iron. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - The dissolved iron ions react with the oxygen to establish bonds, which is the fundamental step in the creation of iron oxide. 6. They form iron oxide, which is rust - At this point, the iron oxide, or rust, is formed by the chemical reaction between the iron and oxygen. This step signifies the completion of the rusting process and the formation of a reddish-brown material on the iron surface."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Step by step analysis: 1. Bats fly through an area - No change in this step due to perturbation. 2. The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose - No change in this step due to perturbation. 3. The sound waves travel away from the bat - No change in this step due to perturbation. 4. The sound waves hit objects - No change in this step due to perturbation. 5. The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat - No change in this step due to perturbation. 6. The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects - The perturbation suggests that the bat does not listen for the returning sound waves. As a result, this step is directly affected by the perturbation. Without listening to the returning sound waves, the bat cannot gain information about the objects' locations. 7. The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from - Because the bat is not listening for the returning sound waves in this perturbation, it will not know where the objects are. This step is also directly affected by the perturbation. 8. The bat doesn't hurt itself by hitting the objects - The perturbed process affects the bat's ability to successfully avoid objects. This step is indirectly affected by the perturbation, as the bat may be more likely to collide with objects without the crucial information provided by the returning sound waves.

Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of war materiel during the Second World War, such as the Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power the Spitfire, Hurricane, Mosquito and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on Old Trafford football stadium, the nearby home of Manchester United, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again. On 11 March 1941, however, stray bombs aimed at Trafford Park fell onto Old Trafford for a second time, causing serious damage to the stadium. It was comprehensively rebuilt after the war and re-opened in 1949, until which time Manchester United played their home games at Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City in Moss Side.At the outbreak of war in...","completion":"After their stadium, Old Trafford, was damaged by stray bombs during the Manchester Blitz in the Second World War, Manchester United had to locate to Maine Road, the stadium of their local rivals, Manchester City, in Moss Side.

El Mariachi is recruited by CIA agent Sheldon Jeffrey Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt Mexican Army officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the President of Mexico and overthrow the government. Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In recent years, temperatures in the polar areas are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. As a result, the ice and the snow are melting at record-setting rates. One result is that sea levels are rising around the world, putting animals and people at risk. A sheet of ice acts like a huge mirror, reflecting the sun's energy. But ocean water, which is darker than ice, absorbs a lot of it. This causes the ocean to warm, which in turn speeds up ice melting and which leads to even more open waters. The cycle continues until all the ice is gone. \\"As the ice melts, water flows into the oceans, making them less salty. That, along with warmer water temperatures, can harm the creatures that live in, under, and near the ice,\\" says zoologist Michael Stoddard. \\"Cold-adapted animals -- including polar bears, foxes, hares, and seals -- also need ice for travel and survival.\\" \\"Most species of fish, sea spiders, and many other animals and plants that live in the waters of Antarctica don't live anywhere else,\\" Stoddard says. \\"Many of them have special proteins in their bodies keeping them from freezing to death and have other adaptation to the cold that has yet to be explored.\\" Therefore, experts are urging us to reconsider the way we live. The fuels that we burn in cars, power stations, and factories are largely to blame for the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are trapping overmuch heat in our atmosphere. If we can produce fewer of these gases, we can help save the polar ice. \\"Even small things would make a difference, if everyone did them.\\" Michael Stoddard says, \\"That's what we have to figure out in the near future to help save the polar ice and thus protect the oceans and us.\\" Question: The passage is mainly written to _ .

The proud and happy mother feels the first signs of life kicking inside her body. And that same life------many years later------ comes to its end in a widely-used expression, to kick the bucket( ) . The expression to kick the bucket is almost 200 years old. One belief is that it started when an English stableman killed himself by hanging while standing on a bucket. He put a rope around his neck and tied it to a beam in the ceiling, and then kicked the bucket away from under him. Another old expression that comes from England is to kick over the traces. Traces were the chains that held at horse or mule to a wagon or plow. Sometimes, an animal refused to obey and kicked over the traces. Kick around is an expression that is heard often in American English. A person who is kicked around is someone who is treated badly. Usually he is not really being kicked by somebody's foot. He is just not being treated with the respect that all of us want. A person who has kicked around for most of his life is someone who has spent his life moving from place to place. In this case, kicking around means moving often from one place to another. Kick around has another meaning when you use it with the word idea. When you kick around an idea, you are giving that idea some thought. There is no physical action when you kick a person upstairs, although the pain can be as strong .You kick a person upstairs by removing him from an important job and giving him a job that sounds more important, but really is not. Still another meaning of the word kick is to free oneself of a bad habit, such as smoking cigarettes. Health campaigns urge smokers to kick the habit.

To support this conclusion, let's analyze the information provided in the premise. The statement mentions that there is a temple with a huge bell beside it. Significantly, this bell does not have a rope, which means it cannot be rung using the conventional method of pulling a rope to swing the clapper inside the bell. However, the premise further clarifies that the bell's clapper is swung by hand. This piece of information is crucial, as it indicates that it is indeed possible to ring the bell. The method of doing so, in this case, is by using one's hand to swing the clapper, creating the sound that is typically associated with a ringing bell.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Jean Baudrillard (; French: [Za bodRijaR]; 27 July 1929 - 6 March 2007) was a French sociologist, philosopher, cultural theorist, political commentator, and photographer. He is best known for his analyses of media, contemporary culture, and technological communication, as well as his formulation of concepts such as simulation and hyperreality. He wrote about diverse subjects, including consumerism, gender relations, economics, social history, art, Western foreign policy, and popular culture. Baudrillard's provocative 1991 book The Gulf War Did Not Take Place raised his public profile as an academic and political commentator. He argued that the first Gulf War was the inverse of the Clausewitzian formula: not \\"the continuation of politics by other means\\", but \\"the continuation of the absence of politics by other means\\". Accordingly, Saddam Hussein was not fighting the Coalition, but using the lives of his soldiers as a form of sacrifice to preserve his power (p. 72, 2004 edition). The Coalition fighting the Iraqi military was merely dropping 10,000 tonnes of bombs daily, as if proving to themselves that there was an enemy to fight (p. 61). So, too, were the Western media complicit, presenting the war in real time, by recycling images of war to propagate the notion that the U.S.-led coalition and the Iraqi government were actually fighting, but, such was not the case. Saddam Hussein did not use his military capacity (the Iraqi Air Force). His power was not weakened, evinced by his easy suppression of the 1991 internal uprisings that followed afterwards. Overall, little had changed. Saddam remained undefeated, the \\"victors\\" were not victorious, and thus there was no war--i.e., the Gulf War did not occur. The book was originally a series of articles in the British newspaper The Guardian and the French newspaper Liberation. These were published in three parts: \\"The Gulf War Will Not Take Place\\", published during the American military and rhetorical buildup; \\"The Gulf War Is Not Taking Place\\", published during military action; and \\"The Gulf War Did Not Take Place\\", published afterwards. Some critics accused Baudrillard of instant revisionism; a denial of the physical action of the conflict (which was related to his denial of reality in general). Consequently, Baudrillard was accused of lazy amoralism, cynical scepticism, and Berkelian idealism. Sympathetic commentators such as William Merrin (in his book Baudrillard and the Media) have argued that Baudrillard was more concerned with the West's technological and political dominance and the globalization of its commercial interests, and what that means for the present possibility of war. Merrin argued that Baudrillard was not denying that something had happened, but merely questioning whether that something was in fact war or a bilateral \\"atrocity masquerading as a war\\". Merrin viewed the accusations of amorality as redundant and based on a misreading. In Baudrillard's own words (pp. 71-72): Saddam liquidates the communists, Moscow flirts even more with him; he gases the Kurds, it is not held against him; he eliminates the religious cadres, the whole of Islam makes peace with him ... Even ... the 100,000 dead will only have been the final decoy that Saddam will have sacrificed, the blood money paid in forfeit according to a calculated equivalence, in order to preserve his power. What is worse is that these dead still serve as an alibi for those who do not want to have been excited for nothing: at least these dead will prove this war was indeed a war and not a shameful and pointless hoax ...

By Francesca Infante PUBLISHED: 04:07 EST, 21 September 2013 | UPDATED: 19:02 EST, 21 September 2013 Rising up: Carole, pictured after visiting her grandson George for the first time at St Mary's Hospital in London, has long been seen to have aristocratic aspirations The agonies of how to design a new family coat of arms is one no doubt familiar to every aspirational family. So it can come as no surprise that faced with such a challenge the astute former air stewardess Carole Middleton - mother of the Duchess of Cambridge - sought the advice of those valued by other great British families - even those that don't actually exist.","completion":"Carole Middleton's quest for the perfect family coat of arms took her on a whirlwind journey through the annals of British history, as she meticulously researched the symbols and meanings behind the shields of some of the country's most illustrious families. Indeed, such was her determination to ensure that her family's coat of arms was a worthy reflection of their new status, she even sought inspiration from the world of fiction. In her bid to create a coat of arms representative of the Middleton family's rise and achievements, Carole embarked on a voyage of discovery, consulting heraldic experts and delving in the British Library for clues on what her family symbol should entail. But it was when she came across the heraldic emblems of some of the most beloved fictional families in British literature that she realized how powerful and evocative these images could be. Inspired by the great houses of Jane Austen's novels, the banners of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth, and even the fictitious Hogwarts houses in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, Carole recognized that a great coat of arms could not only reflect a family's ancestry and accomplishments, but also their aspirations and dreams for the future. Drawing on the strength and courage symbolized by the lions that adorned the crests of countless English noble families, as well as the grace and elegance represented by the swans gracing the shields of many Scottish clans, Carole enlisted the help of a team of talented artists and craftsmen to bring her vision to life. At the same time, she ensured that her family's own unique history and accomplishments were not forgotten, with symbols representing their business prowess and their ties to the aviation industry she was once a part of. As the final design took shape, Carole couldn't help but feel a sense of immense pride. Her family – humble commoners by birth – had risen to the very upper echelons of British society, forever cemented by the marriage of her daughter to Prince William, future king of England. The coat of arms, she felt, would serve as a testament to the strength, determination, and perseverance that had driven the Middleton family to such lofty heights. And so, with much anticipation and excitement, the finished masterpiece was unveiled. The striking shield, complete with golden hued lions and elegant swans, represented both the humble origins of the Middleton family and the great legacy they had built for themselves. Surrounded by their friends, family, and an admiring public, the Middletons could now proudly bear their new coat of arms – a symbol of their journey, and a reminder of their strength and resilience to future generations. And while some may smirk at the notion of a former air stewardess crafting her family's heraldic legacy, there is no denying the indomitable spirit that has defined Carole Middleton and her family for decades. In creating a coat of arms that encompasses not just their past, but their dreams for the future, Carole has once again defied convention – proving that aspiration, ambition, and determination are qualities deserving of recognition, even in the rarefied world of the British aristocracy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Questions: A builder looking for wood to build a new home is likely to visit what location? Options: - own home - grocery store - boat - carpet - lumberyard A:","completion":"A builder looking for wood to build a new home is likely to visit a lumberyard. The lumberyard is the most sensible option among the given choices, as it is specifically designed to cater to the needs of builders and construction professionals seeking various types of wood, tools, and other building materials. A lumberyard typically offers a wide range of wood products, including dimensional lumber, plywood, and other engineered wood products suitable for residential and commercial construction projects. In contrast, the other options are not in line with common sense, and here's why: 1. Own home: A builder's own home may have some leftover wood from previous projects, but it is highly unlikely that there would be a sufficient amount of wood and variety to meet the needs of building a new home. 2. Grocery store: While some larger grocery stores may carry a limited selection of basic tools and materials, they are unlikely to carry a wide range of wood products suitable for building a new home. Their primary focus is on food and household items, not construction materials. 3. Boat: A boat is an inappropriate location to look for wood for building a new home, as it typically doesn't store construction materials, especially not in large quantities required for home construction. Boats are primarily designed for transportation or recreational use on water, and do not function as suppliers of building materials. 4. Carpet: A carpet store specializes in selling flooring materials, such as carpets, rugs, and other floor coverings. While they might have some adhesives or tools related to flooring, it is highly improbable that they would carry the wood materials needed to build a new home. In conclusion, a builder looking for wood to build a new home should visit a lumberyard to find the necessary materials for their project. Lumberyards offer a comprehensive selection of wood and building materials required for new home construction, making them the most sensible choice in this scenario."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Superfecundation Superfecundation is the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse, which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. The term superfecundation is derived from fecund, meaning the ability to produce offspring. Heteropaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. Homopaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to fraternal twins. While heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning, genetically, the twins are half siblings.

Thomas Mueller celebrated signing a new contract with Bayern Munich by helping the Bundesliga champions to win the pre-season German Supercup clash with runners-up Schalke on Saturday. The 20-year-old, a revelation for Germany at the 2010 World Cup after scoring five goals, broke the deadlock in the second half in Augsburg before Miroslav Klose sealed a 2-0 win. Before the match, he agreed a two-year extension to his previous deal, which was due to expire in 2013. \\"A dream has come true for me, and not just in the course of last season,\\" Mueller, who was joint top scorer in South Africa and also named best young player, told the Bayern website. \\"I come from Bavaria, and FC Bayern is my club. I'm delighted that I'll continue to wear a Bayern shirt for the next five years.\\" Bayern lost 3-1 to Schalke last week in the Liga Total Cup friendly event, as coach Louis Van Gaal fielded several reserve players. But the Dutchman included six World Cup stars -- minus the injured Arjen Robben -- in a traditional pre-season fixture between league and cup winners which has been reinstated on the calendar after a 14-year absence.

Bayern, who also won the German Cup last season as well as reaching the final of the UEFA Champions League, took the lead in the 75th minute. Mueller slotted into the empty net when veteran striker Klose put the ball past onrushing goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Klose, who scored four goals at the World Cup to move second in the all-time scorers list with Gerd Mueller, doubled the lead from close range six minutes later after Ivica Olic beat Schalke's new Spanish defender Sergio Escudero and provided the assist.

Options are: [A]. no; [B]. yes;","completion":"To answer your multi-choice problem: [B]. yes; Both questions are related to the same situation, seeking clarity on personal sexuality and gender identity. Now, let's address your concerns. It's important to understand that gender identity and sexual orientation are two different concepts. Gender identity refers to how an individual identifies themselves (e.g., male, female, or non-binary). Sexual orientation, on the other hand, refers to who a person is attracted to (e.g., heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual). When you say that you're a \\"lesbian trapped in a man's body,\\" it could mean that you identify as a woman (transgender woman) and are attracted to other women. Alternatively, you might be an effeminate male, which means you identify as male but have interests and mannerisms that may be considered more traditionally feminine. It's crucial to differentiate between the two to make sense of your feelings. 1. Reflect on your gender identity: Do you feel like a woman, a man, or something in between or beyond the binary? Allow yourself time to reflect on this and explore your feelings without judgment or expectations. 2. Consider your sexual orientation: Are you attracted to women, men, both, or neither? Remember that attraction can be emotional, romantic, and sexual in nature. 3. Seek support: Reach out to trusted friends, family members, or mental health professionals who can provide you with empathy and understanding as you navigate your journey. 4. Research and education: Seek out information on LGBTQ+ topics, such as gender identity and sexual orientation, to help you understand and interpret your feelings better. 5. Be patient: Recognizing and understanding your gender identity and sexual orientation can be a process that takes time. It's essential to be patient with yourself and allow for growth and change. Remember, the journey of self-discovery is unique to each person, and there is no right or wrong way to identify yourself. It's important to give yourself the time and space you need to understand your feelings and explore your identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The collision happened in Bridgehouses at Kelham Island and is causing traffic to be backed up along Penistone Road. Transport operator Stagecoach Yorkshire said at 1.30pm there are delays to services which are being diverted along Hoyle Street, Meadow Street and Scotland Street between Shalesmoor and West Bar. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"traffic flow is likely to be slowed\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can conclude that the traffic flow is likely to be slowed near Sheffield city centre this afternoon. There are several reasons for this conclusion, as elaborated below: 1. Road Traffic Collision: The primary cause of the traffic slowdown is the road traffic collision that occurred in Bridgehouses at Kelham Island. Such collisions often cause disruptions, reducing the efficiency of traffic flow as vehicles might need to slow down or stop while passing the accident site. Emergency vehicles may also need to access the scene, further impacting traffic. 2. Traffic Backup along Penistone Road: As a direct consequence of the collision, there is a reported backup of traffic along Penistone Road. This indicates that the collision has already caused congestion on the road, which in turn is likely to slow down the movement of vehicles along this route. 3. Delays to Bus Services: Stagecoach Yorkshire, the transportation operator in the area, has confirmed at 1.30 pm that there are delays to their services. This further supports the idea that traffic flow has been negatively impacted by the collision. 4. Service Diversions: In an attempt to mitigate the impact of the collision, buses are being diverted along alternate routes, including Hoyle Street, Meadow Street, and Scotland Street between Shalesmoor and West Bar. This may alleviate some of the congestion around the collision site, but traffic flow on the diversion routes may also be slower than usual as these roads have to accommodate additional volumes of traffic. Overall, taking into account the road traffic collision, the traffic backup along Penistone Road, the delays to bus services, and the service diversions, it is reasonable to conclude that traffic flow near Sheffield city centre is likely to be slowed this afternoon. As a result, road users in the area may face longer than usual travel times and should consider alternative routes or modes of transportation, if possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Each section contains a liquid crystal sample with a different liquid crystalline range. The section whose liquid crystalline range corresponds to the temperature of the body becomes translucent (here shown in green), indicating the temperature. We also see the effect of liquid crystals in nature. Iridescent green beetles, known as jewel beetles, change color because of the light-reflecting properties of the cells that make up their external skeletons, not because of light absorption from their pigment. The cells form helices with a structure like those found in cholesteric liquid crystals. When the pitch of the helix is close to the wavelength of visible light, the cells reflect light with wavelengths that lead to brilliant metallic colors. Because a color change occurs depending on a person’s angle of view, researchers in New Zealand are studying the beetles to develop a thin material that can be used as a currency security measure. The automobile industry is also interested in exploring such materials for use in paints that would change color at different viewing angles. With only molecular structure as a guide, one cannot precisely predict which of the various liquid crystalline phases a given compound will actually form. One can, however, identify molecules containing the kinds of structural features that tend to result in liquid crystalline behavior, as demonstrated in Example 11.

Article:","completion":"Title: Sri Lankan Cricket Captain Apologizes for Disappointing Tour of England Introduction: As the thrilling cricket series comes to an end, the Sri Lankan Cricket team's journey in England has left their fans and supporters wanting more. In response, Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews has taken the time to address his team's performance in the recently-concluded tour of England, offering a heartfelt apology for the lack of results and the determination to bounce back. Body: The Sri Lankan cricket team, led by Angelo Mathews, embarked on their tour of England earlier this summer, hoping to have a memorable performance in the series. However, the team could not live up to the expectations set by their supporters, as their disappointing tour ended with a drubbing in the recently concluded Test, One Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 series. In a display of humility and responsibility, Captain Angelo Mathews acknowledged the subpar performance of his team and apologized to the fans. He graciously admitted, \\"We were awful during this tour of England, and we need to be better. We could not give the fans the kind of cricket they were expecting.\\" Aside from their comprehensive defeat in all three formats of the game, the Sri Lanka cricket team came under scrutiny for their lackluster performance in the field and numerous dropped catches. Their fielding has been cited as a significant reason for the disappointing outcome of the tour, as it affected their overall performance significantly. However, despite the disappointing results, Mathews remained optimistic about the team's future. The Sri Lankan captain expressed his determination to address their shortcomings and improve in the upcoming series. He said, \\"We will learn from our mistakes and strive to make amends in the future. Our goal is to repay the faith and support of our fans.\\" In an effort to strengthen the team's performance, the Sri Lanka Cricket board has plans to introduce specialized fielding coaches, hoping that their expertise will help improve the team's fielding skills. This approach, combined with the captain's determination and the team's motivation to bounce back from their recent performance, indicates that the Sri Lankan cricket team is keen to come back stronger than ever in their upcoming series. Conclusion: The recently concluded tour of England has undoubtedly been a wake-up call for the Sri Lankan cricket team. Angelo Mathews' sincere apology and resolve to improve demonstrate a captain who is ready to face the challenges head-on. The future of the Sri Lankan cricket team is uncertain, but with a focused mindset and a dedication to improvement, one can hope to witness a triumphant comeback in their next series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They \\"reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives.\\" In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the Continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles. Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. In French lodges, for example, the line \\"As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened\\" was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to \\"initiate the unenlightened\\". This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy. In fact, many lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe. Which lodges assigned themselves the duty to \\"initate the unenlightened\\"? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The British lodges assigned themselves the duty to \\"initiate the unenlightened.\\" Freemasonry and its ideals were prominent among the thinkers of the Enlightenment, and many lodges aimed to share and disseminate knowledge and values associated with this movement.

She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse.

Review: The book doesn't have an original cover, and it looks like it was stolen from a library since there is a bookcard inside the book Is this product review negative? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the product review is negative. The reviewer is expressing their dissatisfaction with the book they received due to several reasons. First, the book appears to be lacking an original cover, which can be seen as a sign of poor quality or lack of care put into the product's presentation. Original covers often serve as an important aspect for readers, as they indicate a book's identity and showcase its unique artwork. The absence of it can lead to a less appealing and unprofessional appearance. Second, the reviewer mentions that the book looks like it was stolen from a library since it contains a book card inside. This situation raises concerns about the book's legitimacy and the seller's ethical practices. Libraries usually have strict protocols for book thefts, and customers typically do not expect to receive stolen goods when they make a purchase. In this case, the reviewer obviously feels misled and disappointed by the seller's conduct and the book's background. This negative review can potentially influence other potential buyers to reconsider purchasing from the seller or choosing this book. A product review serves as a crucial method for prospective customers to gauge the quality, authenticity, and satisfaction level associated with a product. In this case, the negative tone and specific issues raised in the review can be a red flag for potential customers and may tarnish the book's reputation in the eyes of possible buyers. Overall, the reviewer's dissatisfaction is palpable in their description of the book's quality and its questionable origin.

Composed for the 1709–10 Venice Carnevale season, the opera tells the story of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an \\"anti-heroic satirical comedy\\", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI. Handel composed Agrippina at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including Agrippina, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century. In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007. Modern critical opinion is that Agrippina is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made it one of the most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival.

Frost entered Dartmouth University in 1893, but dropped out, and switched to Harvard, which he attended for two years. He started a brief teaching career, where he was inspired to become a poet by some of his students' work. Frost stopped teaching and became a farmer. During this time he wrote numerous poems, and a couple of short stories. While he was a farmer he started to think seriously about becoming a famous poet. In almost all of his poems, Frost wrote in the first person. The first widely-read poem that he published was called My Butterfly. At first his audience was very small, but with his Collected Poems he became famous. Robert Frost received almost all the awards that there were for poetry. His poetry describes the forces of nature, and the violence and deep emotional needs of human beings, which reflect the experiences of his childhood. Robert Frost will always be known as one of the best poets in history. His way of putting emotion and violence into words is remarkable .

Three Norwegian scientists are in a snow cat are following a signal. They stop suddenly, and after a few moments, a crack in the snow/ice causes the snow cat to fall into a fissure in the ice and gets wedged. The lights from the snow cat are pointed down into the fissure and reveal a spaceship.Sander, a Norwegian scientist, visits an American Paleontologist, named Kate, and tells her that they have discovered a structure and an organism and convinces her to come to Antartica.Kate and her colleague, Adam, fly in a helicopter to the Norwegian camp in Antarctica piloted by Americans Carter and Jameson. They get to camp and meet the other Norwegians including Edvard who is in charge of the camp and Lars, a mechanic who is the only one that doesn't speak any English and has an Alaskan Malamute.Upon arrival, Kate and Adam and the Norwegians get into a snow cat and go to the site where we see a full view of the top of the ship in the ice. Some distance from the ship, they show Kate the strange-looking organism encased in ice. Back at camp they discuss the removal of the organism.The organism is removed and is in a wooden room back at the camp still encased in the ice block. Sander tells the team that he wants to take a tissue sample first, which Kate objects to as they need to do sterilization and take other precautionary measures. He tells her not to question him again in front of the others. They drill a hole into the ice and remove a frozen flesh sample from the organism and place it in a petri dish.Later, in the camp's rec room, the entire team is partying and realize the discovery they have made: aliens. Meanwhile, the ice block is beginning to melt. While everyone is partying, a shot cuts to the Alaskan malamute in its cage and it's barking and trying to get out. Jameson comes out of the bathroom and goes into the room with the ice block. Lars scares him by yelling 'boo' from behind and then Lars leaves. All of a sudden, the unseen Thing breaks out of the ice and jumps through the ceiling.... The answer is:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Thing,\\" Carrington does not actually find anything in the greenhouse, as the character Carrington does not exist in this particular film. The plot you described is the 2011 prequel to the 1982 John Carpenter's \\"The Thing,\\" which is a different film from the original 1951 movie, \\"The Thing from Another World.\\" In the 1951 film, Dr. Arthur Carrington is a character who is a scientist studying the extraterrestrial organism. If you are interested in the 2011 prequel, the character Carrington is not present, and thus does not find anything in the greenhouse. However, the movie's central focus is on the discovery of the alien organism and its impact on the Norwegian research team. The film explores how the organism has the ability to assimilate and imitate other life forms, leading to paranoia and distrust among the characters as they try to determine who has been infected and replaced by the \\"thing.\\" In both the 1982 and 2011 films, the greenhouse does not play a significant role; hence, nothing particularly crucial is found there. The main discoveries and events related to the \\"thing\\" occur in other parts of the research station or the site where the alien spacecraft and the organism encased in ice are found. When considering whether or not to invest in a film proposal, it's essential to focus on the critical elements such as the plot, characters, and setting, as well as the potential for general audience appeal and commercial success. In the case of \\"The Thing,\\" the movie has enjoyed a cult following, particularly John Carpenter's 1982 version, and has an intriguing plot that offers suspense, horror, and sci-fi elements that could attract potential viewers.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"As the original question does not present any specific methods to choose from, I will provide you with two potential approaches, evaluate them and suggest which one appears to be more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of making Buddha shaped pears. Method 1: Using pear molds This method involves growing pears by placing them inside a mold that shapes them as they grow. Follow these steps for this technique: 1. Acquire Buddha-shaped pear molds. You can look for them online, at gardening suppliers or have them custom-made with a 3D printer. 2. Choose an appropriate pear variety. It's essential to select a pear type that has a taste, size, and growth pattern suitable for your purpose. 3. Plant the pear trees and wait for them to bloom and start developing small fruits. 4. Early in the development stage, place the pear molds around the small fruits. Plastic molds with two halves work well for this purpose. 5. Secure the molds to the tree branches, ensuring they are tightly closed and locked around the pears. 6. Monitor the pears' growth regularly. Make sure the pears grow and expand properly within the mold without any issues. 7. Once the pears have completely filled the mold, and the fruit is ripe, carefully remove the mold and harvest your Buddha shaped pears. Method 2: Carving the pears after harvest Using a skilled fruit carver, follow these steps for this technique: 1. Choose a pear variety appropriate for carving. Select a type of pear that has a suitable taste, size, and firmness for carving. 2. Plant and grow the pear trees. Care for them until they bear fruit and the pears become ripe. 3. Harvest the pears, making sure you pick the ones with the ideal size and shape for carving. 4. Wash and clean the pear's surface. Dry them well before starting the carving process. 5. Use a sharp, precise carving tool and carve the Buddha shape into the pear. Depending on the intricacy, you may need to apply different tools, such as X-Acto knives and wood carving tools. 6. Work patiently and delicately, following a design or picture of the Buddha shape you want to create. 7. Once satisfied with the carving, store the Buddha shaped pears in a cool place or serve them immediately, depending on your purpose. Evaluation and Conclusion: While both methods can accomplish the goal of making Buddha shaped pears, the more reasonable approach is using pear molds (Method 1). This method is less labor-intensive, less reliant on artistic skills, and provides more consistent results. Additionally, the pears grown directly in the molds will have better longevity compared to their carved counterparts, making them more suitable for distribution, sale, and presentation purposes. On the other hand, carving the pears after harvest (Method 2) requires more skill and time and may not yield consistent results. Furthermore, the carved pears will have a shorter shelf life due to their exposed flesh, potentially leading to faster spoilage. In conclusion, using pear molds (Method 1) is the more reasonable method for achieving the goal of making Buddha shaped pears."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is the premise \\"A dog is jumping as he turns around on a beach.\\" true if \\"the dog is asleep\\"?","completion":"If we consider the statement \\"A dog is jumping as he turns around on a beach,\\" we must first examine its composition. The statement includes four main aspects: 1. A dog: referring to the subject - the dog. 2. Is jumping: this indicates an action being performed by the subject - in this case, jumping. 3. As he turns around: this adds another action happening concurrently with the first action - turning around. 4. On a beach: this defines the location where the actions are taking place - the beach. Now that we've broken down the statement, we can assess whether it remains true given the additional information that \\"the dog is asleep.\\" Sleep is a state of rest or inactivity that is characterized by a lack of physical and mental exertion. When a creature is sleeping, it is typically not engaging in any other activities. In the context of the original statement, during sleep, the dog would not be able to jump or turn around since both these actions require physical movement and effort that contradict the state of rest implicit in sleep. Given the information that \\"the dog is asleep,\\" we can logically conclude that the dog is not performing any physical actions, such as jumping and turning around. Therefore, the premise \\"A dog is jumping as he turns around on a beach\\" cannot be true if \\"the dog is asleep.\\" To further understand this discrepancy, we can explore the two different scenarios separately: 1. The dog is jumping and turning around on a beach: In this scenario, the dog is actively engaging in physical activities on the beach. It is experiencing a state of alertness and is very likely to be awake during these actions. 2. The dog is asleep: In this scenario, the dog is resting and not engaging in any activities. It is not alert and is unable to perform actions like jumping and turning around. These two scenarios are mutually exclusive. A dog cannot be simultaneously asleep and actively jumping and turning around on a beach. The presence of one scenario (i.e., the dog is asleep) negates the validity of the other scenario (i.e., the dog is jumping and turning around on a beach). In conclusion, the premise \\"A dog is jumping as he turns around on a beach\\" cannot be true if \\"the dog is asleep.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a hypothesis: The town is south of a large stone church. Here are the options: Pick from: [-] yes; [-] it is not possible to tell; [-] no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"[-] No. The hypothesis cannot be conclusively confirmed to be true based on the provided premise. There are some key differences and uncertainties embedded in the premise and the hypothesis that we should consider. First, let's clarify the definition of the terms mentioned. A chapel and a church, while similar, are not the same thing. A chapel is typically smaller in size and is used for prayer and small scale worship, while a church is larger and is designed for full congregational worship. Additionally, the term church often indicates a specific organization or governance, while a chapel does not necessarily carry the same implications. Also, there's a difference in the construction procedure and structure implied by the premise and the hypothesis. The premise mentions a chapel \\"carved out of a rock,\\" which implies a single rock or a rocky outcrop that's been shaped into a chapel. This suggests a certain sense of uniqueness, possibly even a solitary kind of appearance. On the other hand, the hypothesis describes a \\"large stone church.\\" This generally implies that stone blocks or components were used to construct it, which is inherently a different process from carving something out of a singular rock. Building with stone pieces does not necessarily carry the same unique, one-piece characteristic that the premise does. Therefore, considering these differences in building methods and semantic nuances between 'chapel' and 'church', we cannot definitively say that the premise being true guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. The town may very well be south of an unusual little chapel carved out of rock, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's south of a large stone church. The two aren't interchangeable nor equivalent in their implications or descriptions. Thus, if the premise is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the hypothesis is also true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While engaging in such a mentally demanding activity can lead to personal growth, development, and possibly even enlightenment, it may also result in unwanted side effects, such as headaches. Headaches can be caused by various factors, including tension, stress, and prolonged periods of concentration. When someone engages in cogitation, they often focus and concentrate their thoughts for an extended period, leading to mental strain. This strain, in turn, can lead to headaches, particularly in those prone to migraines or tension headaches. As a result, an individual might choose to avoid cogitating to minimize the risk of developing a headache. This decision is in line with common sense, as it serves to protect the individual's well-being and health. Pursuing other activities, such as dancing, can provide an alternative way to relieve stress and enjoy oneself without exerting too much mental effort. However, it's worth noting that each person has different thresholds for experiencing headaches, and this answer may not apply universally. Furthermore, reaching conclusions and making decisions are essential aspects of daily life which cannot be entirely avoided. Therefore, it's crucial to strike a balance between engaging in deep thought and taking breaks or engaging in relaxing activities to ensure both mental and physical well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Melanie Jayne Chisholm was born in Whiston, Lancashire, as the only child in the family. She later moved to Widnes, Cheshire, at a young age. Her parents married on 12 January 1971 and separated in 1978, when young Chisholm was four-and-a-half years old. Her father, Alan Chisholm, worked as a fitter at the Otis Elevator Company. Chisholm's music is generally pop and rock. She also released an album of show tunes. Chisholm has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Spice Girls and her solo efforts. The main concept of the Spice Girl albums centred on the idea of Girl Power, embodying a feminist image, as both Madonna and Bananarama had employed before, and every track deals with different aspects of this notion. Other central themes in the writing of the group were the union, solidarity, friendship, independence, love, loss of virginity, sex, contraception, the relationship with parents during adolescence, vulnerability and fame. Many of these themes were carried out even during her solo career, but with a more mature writing, intense style and in some songs a more raw and direct language. Added to these were social issues such as homelessness, and introspective themes. Having co-written 11 UK number 1s, more than any other female artist, she remains the only female performer to top the charts as a solo artist, as part of a duo, quartet and quintet. With 12 UK Number 1 singles, including the charity single as part of the Justice Collective, she is the second female artist - and the first British female artist - with the most singles at number 1 in the UK, and with a total of 14 songs that have risen to number 1 in Britain (including the double A-sides), Chisolm is the first artist with most number 1 songs in the UK ranking history. On 1 January 2004, Virgin Records dismissed Chisholm after the conflict in previous years about the direction in her solo career. In April 2004, she founded her own label, Red Girl Records, to record and release her own projects. All of Chisolm's activities are decided upon and funded by herself, alongside her business partner and manager, Nancy Phillips. The name was inspired by the colours of the football Liverpool F.C., which Chisholm is supporter. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article.

Additionally, Chisholm has addressed various social issues and introspective themes in her music, showcasing her versatility as an artist. Another interesting aspect is her transition from being under a major label, Virgin Records, to founding her own label, Red Girl Records, in 2004. This decision to take control of her own music career signifies her determination and independence as an artist.

Maura is a down on her luck single mother who's facing eviction from her house, which lead her to the rash decision to marry an illegal immigrant, Wilson, in exchange of €9,000. Maura's daughter Molly believes that her mother truly loves Wilson and that she's getting a new father. Meanwhile, Freddie, a nice guy with OCD-esque habits, is remarrying the selfish and very image-conscious Sophie after a recent divorce. The receptions for both weddings are being held in the same hotel. Freddie and Maura's paths keep crossing, leading to Sophie wrongly assuming that the two are involved in an illicit affair. To complicate matters, two immigration officers arrive at the wedding reception to investigate Wilson and Maura. Eventually Molly learns that her mother is involved in a scam and has no feelings for Wilson. Believing her suspicions of an affair to be true, Sophie flees the wedding. Presuming Freddie responsible, Sophie's aggressive father loses his cool and attempts to assault Freddie. Meanwhile, Sophie has gone to a pub in Dublin with some working class girls who support her decision to run away as they believe Freddie to be a lecherous cheater.

Short movie review: wasting Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The critic offered a mostly negative review of the movie. The title \\"Wasting\\" seems to foreshadow feelings of disillusionment and disappointment with the film. The use of the word \\"short\\" might also suggest that the critic found the movie lacking in substance or depth. To reinforce this interpretation, I will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the movie review below: From the opening scene, the critic felt that the movie \\"Wasting\\" started with a promising premise. The audience is introduced to a group of characters that are instantly relatable and intriguing, all facing their own personal struggles and challenges. The cinematography, sound design, and lighting work together to create a visually engaging and atmospheric experience. However, as the story unfolds, the critic becomes disillusioned with the movie's progression. The critic argues that the film lacks cohesiveness, as the plot meanders with no clear direction or purpose. Instead of building tension and suspense, the movie feels unnecessarily drawn out, only serving to increase the viewer's frustration and impatience. Despite the strong performances from the cast, the shallow character development makes it difficult to connect with or care about their individual stories. One of the primary criticisms is the poorly executed pacing. The movie takes long, drawn-out shots that aim to create an atmosphere and build tension but ultimately fail in delivering the intended emotional impact and simply result in a slow and tedious viewing experience. Additionally, the movie's dialogue feels forced and artificial, taking the viewer out of the story. The critic finds it hard to believe that the characters would express themselves in the manner portrayed on the screen, making their interactions feel stilted and detached from reality. The redeeming qualities of \\"Wasting\\" include occasional moments of dark humor and the poignant exploration of complex emotions associated with loss, guilt, and regret. However, these aspects are not powerful enough to salvage the overall experience and lift the movie out of its state of mediocrity. In conclusion, the critic's overall impression is negative, with the movie \\"Wasting\\" failing to live up to its initial promise. The critic acknowledges there are some positive aspects to be found, such as strong acting performances and moments of emotional depth. However, these are overshadowed by major flaws in plot development, pacing, and dialogue that ultimately render the film unsatisfying and tedious to watch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"Northern Ireland's five education and library boards will cease to exist at midnight.\\"","completion":"Title: The End of an Era: Northern Ireland’s Five Education and Library Boards to Dissolve at Midnight Introduction It has been reported that Northern Ireland's five Education and Library Boards (ELBs) are to cease to exist at midnight. This development signals a shift in the administration of the education system in the region and paves the way for a more centralized and uniform approach to education and library services in the coming years. Background The five ELBs were established back in 1973, overseeing state schools and library services in the areas of Belfast, North Eastern, Southern, South Eastern, and Western. Their primary responsibilities included managing schools, distributing funding, providing necessary resources, as well as managing staff appointments and training. This system, which has been in place for almost five decades, has seen numerous changes and challenges in the region. It has catered to a wide range of demographics and needs, shaping educational policies and curriculum accordingly. However, despite its longevity, there has been growing concern about the efficiency and relevance of the ELBs in recent years. Questions have been raised about fragmentation in approaches, administrative inefficiencies, financial disparities amongst schools, and a lack of adaptability to evolving educational needs. The Reform The dissolution of the five ELBs is the result of an extensive reform process that has been in the works for the past few years, gaining momentum in response to the aforementioned concerns. Subsequent consultations and studies led to proposals for the creation of a more unified, efficient, and cost-effective replacement—the Education Authority (EA). The EA will act as a single, centralized body for the administration of education and library services in Northern Ireland. With the goal of providing an equitable and effective distribution of resources, the EA aims to address disparities amongst schools and regions, centralize decision-making processes, and expedite growth and progress in the education sector. Implications and Expected Outcomes The move to dissolve the ELBs and replace them with a centralized authority encompasses various implications and possible outcomes. Some of these include: 1. Greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness: The EA will take over the duties of five separate ELBs, potentially reducing administrative redundancies and streamlining decision-making processes. As a result, the EA can allocate resources more swiftly and equitably, positively affecting schools in need of support. 2. A unified approach to education and library services: The establishment of the EA is expected to bring about a harmonized approach to educational policies and programs in Northern Ireland. This could lead to more uniform curriculum and resources being available across all schools, augmenting educational standards and promoting parity. 3. Adaptability and innovation: The formation of a single authority with a streamlined structure is likely to bolster adaptability to the ever-changing educational needs and demands of the region. The EA could prove to be more progressive and innovative, endorsing the adoption of new methodologies and technologies in teaching and learning. 4. Enhanced accountability: A centralized Education Authority inherently increases accountability, as it would be the focal point for all matters concerning education and library services. This could lead to more transparency and better governance in the education sector. Challenges Ahead As this new era begins, there will undoubtedly be challenges accompanying the transition. The initial amalgamation of the five ELBs into the EA will likely involve a period of adjustment as the new authority settles into its roles and responsibilities. It is crucial that the EA addresses the concerns and needs of educators, parents, and communities to ensure a smooth transformation. Additionally, monitoring the performance of the centralized body and seeking continuous improvement will be key to the success of the new system. Conclusion The dissolution of Northern Ireland’s five Education and Library Boards marks the end of an era. In their place, the Education Authority emerges with the promise of a more efficient, unified, and equitable administration of the region's education system and library services. As the EA takes on this important mantle, its success will depend on its ability to adapt, innovate, and maintain transparency, with the ultimate goal of fostering an inclusive and high-quality education for all in Northern Ireland."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. A central feature of the white community in Rhodesia was its transience, as white settlers were just as likely to leave Rhodesia after a few years rather than permanently settle; for example, of the 700 British settlers who were the first white settlers, arriving in 1890, only 15 were still living in Rhodesia in 1924. As the white population of Rhodesia had a low birth rate (18 per 1,000 compared to the African rate of 48 per 1,000), to maintain white population growth was largely dependent upon taking in new white immigrants with immigration accounting for 60% of the growth of the white Rhodesian population between 1955–72. However, the American historian Josiah Brownell noted that the turnover rate for white residents in Rhodesia was very high, as Rhodesia took in a total of 255,692 white immigrants between 1955–79 while the same period a total of 246,583 whites emigrated. Even during the boom years of the late 1950s, when Rhodesia took in an average of 13,666 white immigrants per year, mostly from the United Kingdom and South Africa, an average of about 7,666 whites emigrated annually. Between 1961–65, Rhodesia took in an average of 8,225 white immigrants per year while also having an average white emigration of 12, 912 per year. Many prospective white immigrants in Rhodesia arrived seeking economic opportunities and departed with fluctuations in the security situation as the Bush War intensified. A substantial number were uninterested in settling there permanently and did not apply for Rhodesian citizenship, despite a much-publicised 1967 campaign urging them to do so. Brownell asserted that patriotism in the white community was \\"shallow\\" due to its essentially expatriate character. Brownell also claimed that the majority of white immigrants in the late 1960s and early 1970s were unskilled laborers who competed with the countrys black African workforce and did not contribute badly needed technical or professional skills to the country. He argued that this was due to a government policy aimed at making white immigration as \\"unselective as possible\\" and guaranteeing every white immigrant a job. Answer this question: How many more, per 1000, was the birth rate in Africa than the white population of Rhodesia?","completion":"The African birth rate was 48 per 1,000, and the white population of Rhodesia had a birth rate of 18 per 1,000. So, the African birth rate was 30 more per 1,000 than the white population of Rhodesia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. You are given a new situation: Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land. Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands. and a hint : Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.

Ryan leaves Lincoln while the divorce is pending and goes to New York to find himself. He is alone, living in a cheap room, and almost broke. He has an invitation from an old friend to an eclectic/beat party in Greenwich Village. He shows up and meets Gittel Mosca (Shirley MacLaine) at the party. Mosca is a Brooklynite who left home on her own and rented an apartment in Greenwich Village when she was fifteen. She works as a dancer of sorts, and has had a number of relationships. Ryan and Mosca hook up after a day or so and start a relationship. The core theme of the picture is how their relationship expands and develops their self-respect of themselves. The turning point for Mosca comes when she gets sick and, as Ryan is storming down the stairway, she leans over the railing and begs for help. Ryan takes her to the hospital and looks after her when she is released. Mosca discovers intimacy within love. Class rears its ugly head, but they get over it. They are acting like married people in love. Ryan receives notice that the divorce is final, but he is still conflicted about his ex (Tess).

When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\" He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Between galactose and lactase, which is a part of lactose?\\" Context: \\"Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts, glucose and galactose. Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine. Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods. This is commonly known as lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance varies widely by ethnic heritage; more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant, in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Between galactose and lactase, galactose is a part of lactose. To further elaborate, lactose is a disaccharide sugar, which means that it is composed of two monosaccharides (simple sugars) bonded together. In the case of lactose, these two monosaccharides are glucose and galactose. Thus, galactose is one of the two components that make up lactose, the sugar found primarily in milk and dairy products. On the other hand, lactase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the digestion of lactose. Enzymes are specialized proteins that catalyze or accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms, making them essential for various biological processes. In the context of lactose metabolism, lactase is responsible for breaking down lactose into its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. The human small intestine produces lactase to facilitate the absorption of glucose and galactose and derive energy from lactose. However, the production of lactase in adults can vary widely, leading to lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is a common condition in which individuals have difficulty digesting lactose due to insufficient lactase production. The prevalence of lactose intolerance varies significantly among different populations and is influenced by ethnic heritage. For instance, over 90 percent of people of East Asian descent are lactose intolerant, while only about 5 percent of people of Northern European descent have this condition. The inability to produce adequate lactase results in improper lactose digestion, causing gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea after consuming milk-based products. In conclusion, galactose is a part of lactose, while lactase is the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose into its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. Lactose intolerance occurs when individuals produce insufficient lactase, making it difficult for them to digest lactose in milk and dairy products. This condition's prevalence varies among different populations, with some ethnic groups being more susceptible to lactose intolerance than others."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

According to the details given, the interesting projects are obtaining the following funding: 1. 4 million for millennium art projects 2. 22 million for new chanceries in Colombia, Haiti, Venezuela, and South Korea 3. 3.2 million for senators 4. 1 million for international environmental organizations To determine the total spending on these interesting projects, let's add these values: 4,000,000 (millennium art projects) + 22,000,000 (new chanceries) + 3,200,000 (senators) + 1,000,000 (international environmental organizations) = 30,200,000 The total spending on these interesting projects is 30,200,000. As we can see, this amount is significantly higher than the 100,003 mentioned in the sentence, thus making it false. The government is, in fact, spending more than 100,003 on these projects; the actual spending amounts to 30,200,000, showcasing the inaccuracy of the statement in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – Things that weigh less than the \\"fatberg\\" removed from a London sewer: 18 horses, 3 Hummer H2s, or 77,000 iPhone 6s. A \\"fatberg\\" is what is created when congealed fat and unflushable items (think sanitary napkins, diapers, wipes, the Independent notes) combine in the sewer to create, well, the stuff of nightmares, and a 1940s-era sewer in London has been broken by an 131-foot-long one weighing roughly 11 tons. The huge mass was removed after businesses in the affluent Chelsea district complained about a putrid odor, the Evening Standard reports. \\"We see blockages all the time on household sewer pipes, which are about big enough for a cricket ball to pass through, but to have this much damage on a sewer almost a meter in diameter is mind-boggling,\\" a repair and maintenance supervisor at the water company tells the Guardian. Much of the fat comes from used cooking oil, millions of liters of which are poured down drains in London each year. And the wet wipes (which some people are apparently using instead of toilet paper) come from the one in five Londoners who admit to flushing them. \\"I’d urge people to consider what lurks beneath their feet,\\" says the supervisor. \\"When it comes to getting rid of fat, 'bin it—don’t block it.'\\" The whole messy business, including repairs to the sewer, is expected to cost more than 600,000 and take more than two months, with work finishing in May. And yes, the Washington Post notes, the same phenomenon happens here in the USA—New York City spends millions dealing with grease backups—though we don't often use the term \\"fatberg.\\" (This fatberg isn't the biggest in British history, though.) Article:","completion":"Imagine a big, smelly blob made of used cooking oil, wet wipes, diapers, and other yucky stuff. This is called a \\"fatberg,\\" and one was just found in a sewer in London. It was so big and heavy that it broke the sewer! If we wanted to compare its weight, we could say it was as heavy as 18 horses, 3 big cars called Hummer H2s, or 77,000 iPhone 6s. That's really heavy! People who live and work nearby started smelling something really bad, so they asked the water company to check it out. The water company found the fatberg, and they said it was 131 feet long. That's longer than a basketball court! They also said it weighed about 11 tons. No wonder it broke the sewer! The water company says a lot of the fat comes from cooking oil that people pour down their drains. Plus, many people flush wet wipes down the toilet instead of throwing them in the trash. The water company says we should always put fat and trash in the bin, not down the drain or toilet. That way, we can help avoid making more fatbergs. Fixing the broken sewer in London is going to take more than two months and cost more than 600,000. And guess what? Fatbergs can happen in other places, too, like New York City, which spends millions of dollars dealing with them. So let's all do our part to keep our sewers clean and fatberg-free!"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. before you, as a buyer of a dog, decide to buy a bulldog, there are certain things you should take in consideration. both the dog and the family must be considered to be of mutual enjoyment and pleasure to everybody for years to come. Write the above sentence using proper case.","completion":"Before you, as a buyer of a dog, decide to buy a bulldog, there are certain things you should take into consideration. Both the dog and the family must be considered to ensure mutual enjoyment and pleasure for everyone for years to come. When thinking about adding a bulldog to your family, it is essential to consider several factors to ensure a happy and healthy relationship between the dog and all family members. This thoughtful approach will ultimately contribute to a rewarding and long-lasting companionship. Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge that bulldogs, like all breeds, have unique characteristics, behavior traits, and requirements. Understanding these specific traits and how they align with your household's needs is fundamental before making a purchase. Some common attributes of bulldogs include their loyalty, affectionate nature, and protective instincts. While these qualities may make them excellent companions, potential owners should also be mindful of their stubbornness and potential for health issues due to their brachycephalic skull structure. Another imperative consideration is the lifestyle and activity level of your family. Bulldogs are known to be relatively low-energy dogs, requiring less exercise in comparison to more active breeds. If your family leads an excessively active lifestyle or enjoys outdoor activities frequently, a bulldog might not be the best match. Financial aspects should also be taken into account when considering the purchase of a bulldog. Bulldogs can be an expensive breed, often requiring specialized medical care due to various congenital health problems, such as hip dysplasia and respiratory issues. Owners should be prepared for additional costs associated with their dog's healthcare. Lastly, prospective buyers must carefully evaluate the living conditions of their home. For instance, bulldogs don't tolerate extreme temperatures well, so homes in regions with sweltering or freezing climates may not be the best environment for this breed. Additionally, living space should be sufficiently available for the dog to move around and comfortably reside in. Taking these considerations into account will substantially aid in making an informed decision about whether a bulldog is the right fit for you and your family. Ultimately, ensuring that both the dog and family reap mutual enjoyment and pleasure for countless years to come relies on thorough research and thoughtful contemplation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: KFC , one of the most famous fast-food chains, saw its reputation in China shaken because of \\"quick chicken\\". Recent years, KFC has ever shocked us more than once because of its food safety, which made itself in severe trust crisis. Now it greatly surprised us again owing to the poultry incident. We could never believe it should have cheated us again and again. In fact, as a well-known restaurant chain, KFC's business records at China's is not very good. There's no doubt that the very incident has made things worse and worse. However, what surprised us is that although a series of misdeeds had reduced KFC's reputation, its business is increasing. What's more, KFC just made a so-called apology after what had happened, the content of which is not responsible at all for the public. As a matter of fact, this is not an ordinary chance incident. Recent years have seen so many food-safety problems in China, such as wasted oil, lean meat powder , melamine , which has done great damage to people's life. We don't know what can be eaten and how much harmful food we have eaten. Now it is not wars and natural disasters but everyday food safety that has been a great risk to human health. So what can be done to prevent our health from being damaged? To begin with, the related departments should strengthen laws to stop such illegal products from being produced. In addition, it would be a good idea to call on the media to perform its further function to monitor the businesses, factories and traders. Besides, everybody should be made aware of the risks of harmful food and only in this way can people improve their self-protection. In a word, everyone should play a role in making our food safer and better in quality. Meanwhile, the government and the related departments should take their responsibilities for people's health.
