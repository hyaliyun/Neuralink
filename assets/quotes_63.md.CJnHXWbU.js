Which language is this?","completion":"The language of the text is Russian. The user is asking you to provide a fact: the number of people killed in the South Asian Tsunami equals the monthly number of AIDS/HIV victims worldwide. The South Asian Tsunami, which hit on December 26, 2004, was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history. This calamity was caused by a seismic upheaval beneath the Indian Ocean and claimed nearly 230,000 to 280,000 lives in fourteen different countries, with Indonesia being the most affected. The mortality rate from the HIV/AIDS pandemic worldwide is quite high as well. According to UNAIDS data from 2020, around 680,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide. When this number is broken down to a monthly rate, it roughly equates to 56,667 deaths per month. However, these numbers are estimates and not precise. The actual number of deaths can vary for various reasons, including underreporting due to social stigma and accessibility to testing and treatment. The comparison between the number of deaths from the Tsunami and the monthly HIV/AIDS death rate is striking. It emphasizes the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the urgent need for prevention, testing, treatment, and support for those affected. Furthermore, while a Tsunami is an instantaneous event causing immediate destruction, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is a long-term ongoing health crisis. Both these events underline the importance of disaster preparedness, prompt response, and long-term health surveillance. In sum, while on the surface a natural disaster like a Tsunami and a health crisis like HIV/AIDS may seem incomparable, a careful examination of the mortality figures frames them both as massive threats to human lives that require global attention and concerted efforts to mitigate."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

An equation is a math problem that asks you to find a missing value, which in this case is \\"i.\\" In our problem, we have: -402*i - 6296 = -227*i + 6304 To find the value of i, we should follow these steps: 1. Move the \\"i\\" values to one side of the equation and the numbers to the other side. 2. Simplify the equation. 3. Divide by the number next to the \\"i\\" to find the answer. So, let's begin: Step 1: Move the \\"i\\" values to one side and the numbers to the other. We want to move -227*i to the left side, so we add 227*i to both sides of the equation: -402*i + 227*i - 6296 = 6304 Now, move -6296 to the right side. To do that, we add 6296 to both sides of the equation: -402*i + 227*i = 6304 + 6296 Step 2: Simplify the equation. Now, we add the \\"i\\" values and numbers: -402*i + 227*i = -175*i 6304 + 6296 = 12600 So, the simplified equation looks like this: -175*i = 12600 Step 3: Divide by the number next to the \\"i.\\" Now, we want to find the value of \\"i\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by -175: -175*i / -175 = 12600 / -175 Now, when we divide the numbers, we get: i = -72 So, the value of \\"i\\" in the equation is -72."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - The Falkland Islands wolf (\\"Dusicyon australis\\"), also known as the warrah and occasionally as the Falkland Islands dog, Falkland Islands fox, or Antarctic wolf, was the only native land mammal of the Falkland Islands. This endemic canid became extinct in 1876, the first known canid to have become extinct in historical times. It was the only modern species in the genus \\"Dusicyon\\". - The American mink (\\"Neovison vison\\") is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to North America, though human intervention has expanded its range to many parts of Europe and South America. Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN. Since the extinction of the sea mink, the American mink is the only extant member of the genus \\"Neovison\\". The American mink is a carnivore which feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, Pyrenean desman, and water vole populations. It is the most frequently farmed animal for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health. - The martens constitute the genus Martes within the subfamily Mustelinae, in the family Mustelidae. Martens are slender, agile animals, adapted to living in taigas, and are found in coniferous and northern deciduous forests across the Northern Hemisphere. They have bushy tails, and large paws with partially retractible claws. The fur varies from yellowish to dark brown, depending on the species, and, in many cases, is valued by fur trappers. - Skunks are mammals known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong odor. Different species of skunk vary in appearance from black-and-white to brown or cream colored, but all have warning coloration. - The sea mink (\\"Neovison macrodon\\") is an extinct North American member of the family Mustelidae. It is the only mustelid, and one of only two terrestrial mammal species in the order Carnivora known to have become extinct in historic times (the other being the Falkland Islands wolf). The body of the sea mink was significantly longer than that of the closely related American mink (\\"N. vison\\"), and also bulkier, leading to a pelt that was almost twice the size of the other species. The longest specimen recorded was said to be . The sea mink produced a distinctive odor, and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than the American mink's. - The Mustelidae (from Latin \\"mustela\\", weasel) are a family of carnivorous mammals, including the weasel, badger, otter, marten, ferret, mink, stoat, and wolverine. Mustelids are diverse and the largest family in the order Carnivora. The internal classification is still disputed, with rival proposals containing between two and eight subfamilies. One study, published in 2008, questions the long-accepted Mustelinae subfamily, and suggests that the Mustelidae consist of four major clades and three much smaller lineages. - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The sable (\\"Martes zibellina\\") is a marten species, a small carnivorous mammal inhabiting forest environments, primarily in Russia from the Ural Mountains throughout Siberia, eastern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, China, North and South Korea and Hokkaid in Japan. Its range in the wild originally extended through European Russia to Poland and Scandinavia. It has historically been hunted for its highly valued dark brown or black fur, which remains a luxury good to this day. While hunting of wild animals is still common in Russia, most fur in the market is now commercially farmed. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The Pyrenean desman (\\"Galemys pyrenaicus\\") is a small semiaquatic nocturnal mammal related to moles and shrews, and is one of only two surviving species of the tribe Desmanini. The range of the species centers on northwestern Spain and northern Portugal, but it is under threat due to changes to its habitat. In Portugal it's called \\"\\"toupeira-d'água\\"\\" which means \\"water mole\\". - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. - Neovison is a genus of mustelids , including the extinct sea mink and the extant American mink . - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length. What is the relationship between 'neovison' and 'mustelinae'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'Neovison' and 'Mustelinae' lies in their taxonomic classification within the mammalian order Carnivora. 'Neovison' is a genus within the family Mustelidae, which includes species such as the extinct sea mink (Neovison macrodon) and the extant American mink (Neovison vison). On the other hand, 'Mustelinae' is a subfamily of the family Mustelidae. The Mustelidae family comprises carnivorous mammals such as weasels, badgers, otters, martens, ferrets, minks, stoats, and wolverines. The subfamily Mustelinae includes some members of this family, particularly weasels, martens, and related species. However, there is still some dispute over the exact internal structure of the Mustelidae family and the exact membership of the Mustelinae subfamily, as different studies have proposed different classification schemes. In summary, 'Neovison' is a genus within the family Mustelidae, while 'Mustelinae' is a subfamily of the same family. This means that species within the genus 'Neovison' are closely related to species within the subfamily 'Mustelinae,' as they share a common taxonomic family and are part of the same diverse group of carnivorous mammals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Questions: What is likely to happen to a person in Washington State found guilty of stabbing someone to death? Options: - imprisonment - capital punishment - killing - hurt - enlightenment Answer:","completion":"If a person in Washington State is found guilty of stabbing someone to death, they are most likely to face imprisonment. This is because when someone is convicted of a serious crime such as murder, the usual course of action is to sentence them to serve time in prison. This decision is taken by a court of law after due process, where evidence is examined and the degree of the crime and culprit's intent is taken into account. The length of the sentence can depend on a number of factors including the severity of the crime, whether the individual has any prior convictions, their mental state, their age, and other mitigating or aggravating factors. Capital punishment could have been an option historically, but as of 2018, the Washington State Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty, as applied, violates its Constitution. Therefore, this option is no longer legally applicable in Washington State. The options of killing or hurting are not in line with the justice system in the United States, which ensures the right to a fair trial and prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, as per the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Lastly, enlightenment is not a punishment or a consequence of criminal actions. It's a term from philosophy and spirituality, signifying deep insight or awakening, which is unrelated to legal consequences of crimes. Therefore, based on the legal system and current laws, the most appropriate and likely consequence for person in Washington State found guilty of stabbing someone to death would be imprisonment. This punishments serves not only as a deterrent for other potential offenders, but also aims to provide a sort of rehabilitation to the convict and uphold the principle of serving justice for the victim."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: This inverse relationship between solubility and temperature can be understood by looking at a molecular model. Recall that higher temperatures are associated with faster particles. Gas particles are held in solution by attractive interactions with the solvent molecules. If the particles are moving slowly, these attractive forces will pull back any particles that try to escape the surface of the solution and re-enter the gas phase. However, if the gas particles are moving fast enough, these interactions will not be sufficiently strong to prevent this process from occurring. As a result, more particles are able to escape, and the amount of dissolved solute is less than it would be at a lower temperature.

Cooking a brighter future in Athens The refugee crisis has brought hundreds of thousands of people to Greece in recent years, seeking safety and shelter or passage to northern Europe. Many have chosen to stay and make the country their home. One of the many cultural changes these new residents have brought with them to their adopted home is food. Here are three new chefs in Athens reshaping its culinary map. Senait is part of the African community that has made the neighbourhood of Kypseli their home. Once a stronghold of the urban Greek working class, the past few decades have seen Kypseli hollowed out as the western part of downtown Athens was abandoned. Senait is a former soldier from Eritrea, she fled after serving for seven years in the army. She arrived in Greece in 2012, crossing from Turkey to Lesbos on a dinghy. “I tried to leave Greece,” she says “but I didn’t have papers and I was arrested. That was then. Now I want to start something here: my own restaurant.” For now she works with Options Food Lab (OFL), a non-profit organisation which provides people with the opportunity to showcase their talent, organising pop-up events. In a café near to their office, Senait prepares Eritrean dishes for more than 10 guests. The setting is informal even for Athens; someone is getting a tattoo a few metres away from the diners. Injera, a traditional East African sourdough bread, makes the basis of an Eritrean dish, topped with stews that include whole eggs and chicken, a thick lentil soup, and beef curry. Senait has prepared all this in the small flat that she shares with her husband. Their marriage took place in May, after he arrived via the same route as Senait. Now they are trying to make a place for themselves in a country in deep economic crisis, with very limited resources. For now Senait is surviving thanks to the community here in Kypseli, and to the networks like OFL. The neighbourhood of Exarcheia is a centre for many of the initiatives and networks that help refugees stuck in Athens. Steki Metanaston, an organisation for migrants set up to provide anything from language classes to legal help, is the epicentre. Aziz cooks for the organisation, which supplies food to the squats that house refugees around the area. It takes time and work but it can be done – even now. If you want to get into cooking and make a living here, you can “I was born in a restaurant, owned by my grandma” says Aziz, a professional cook who specialises in French cuisine. “My brother is teaching at the cooking school I went to and our younger brother is now training at the same one.” Aziz arrived in Greece in 2010 from Senegal and has been involved with activism ever since. “I could have gone anywhere, but I like it here.” Today he prepares what are essentially Iranian inspired veggie burgers from coriander, parsley and breadcrumbs fried in olive oil. Working out of a tiny kitchen, he organises a team that feeds hundreds of people every day. “When Afghan refugees were staying in Pedion Tou Areos last year,” he says, “we were churning out 3,000 dishes a day.” Hassan Assi arrived from Lebanon in late 2008. He is married to a Greek and despite the crisis he opened Sahara, his own Lebanese restaurant, three years ago in the southern suburb of Glyfada. “It’s difficult,” he says, “it takes time and work. But it can be done even now. People who want to get into cooking and make a living here, can.” Born in Nigeria, he has worked as a waiter, a car dealer, a caterer and many other jobs before settling for that of a cook and restaurateur. “I grew up with a mum who loved cooking,” he says. And it shows in the Middle Eastern food at his restaurant. A variety of perfectly prepared and presented appetisers, followed by varieties of excellent meat; all the staples of the Lebanese cuisine are expertly prepared by Hassan. “Greece could be doing more to keep people here and help them start their own things. Now they won’t give you papers even if you want to invest money and time. It took us a year and half before work became more steady. But now it’s going fine.” Hassan’s tale is not necessarily the most common. But it shows that it is still possible for newcomers to introduce different tastes and aromas to the Greek culinary scene, and to enhance the experience of eating out in Athens. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Amid the refugee crisis in Greece, immigrants are infusing new culinary experiences into the Athens food scene, with three chefs standing out: Senait from Eritrea showcases traditional dishes through Options Food Lab, Aziz from Senegal cooks for an organization that feeds refugees, and Hassan Assi from Lebanon operates his own successful restaurant. Despite obstacles, these chefs underscore the potential for immigrants to enrich Greek gastronomy while making a living in a challenging economic climate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Concepts: hay, pony, stand Write a sentence that includes all these words.","completion":"Hay is an essential component in the diet of many animals, in particular ponies. The pony is a breed of horse that is renowned for its ability to adjust to different weather conditions and is often seen as a symbol of strength and endurance. The word stand can have multiple interpretations in this context. It could denote the place where hay is standing, waiting to be consumed by ponies. It is also an indication of the pony's posture, standing upright and energetic. A sentence that includes all these words could be crafted as follows: \\"In the flickering light of early dawn, the sturdy pony, renowned for its resilience and strength, was seen standing patiently by the hay stand, eagerly waiting to start its day with the nourishment that the freshly stacked hay provided.\\" In this sentence, the connotations associated with each term are interlinked. The hay epitomizes the means of sustenance; it is the food source for the pony. The pony symbolizes vitality and durability. It reflects animated postures and a spirited character. Meanwhile, the stand is a symbol of support, serving as a structured entity that holds the hay in place for the pony. More so, this sentence does more than just list the terms; it transforms these words into components of a beautiful tale, one that brings life to them and crafts a vivid image in the mind of the reader. Alternatively, we can craft a much simpler sentence as well, such as: \\"The young, vibrant pony stood next to the hay stand, ready to munch on its meal.\\" This simple sentence still manages to incorporate all three terms – hay, pony, and stand – while painting a wholesome picture about the horse's eating habits. Whether elaborately detailed or simple and straightforward, both sentences encapsulate the crux of the concepts of hay, pony, and stand. The choice between them will depend on the depth of description and context one wishes to portray."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Jungle Book Context: Mowgli, a young orphan boy, is found in a basket in the deep jungles of India by Bagheera, a black panther who promptly takes him to a mother wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted with jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, playing with his wolf siblings. One night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a man-eating Bengal tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the \\"Man-Village\\" for his own safety. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back. They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle. He and Bagheera rest in a tree for the night, where Kaa, a hungry python, tries to devour Mowgli, but Bagheera intervenes. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol led by Colonel Hathi and his wife Winifred. Bagheera finds Mowgli, but after a fight decides to leave Mowgli on his own. Mowgli soon meets up with the laid-back, fun-loving bear Baloo, who promises to raise Mowgli himself and never take him back to the Man-Village. Shortly afterwards, a group of monkeys kidnap Mowgli and take him to their leader, King Louie the orangutan. King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire like other humans. However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli does not know how to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the ensuing chaos, King Louie's palace is demolished to rubble. Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli so long as Shere Khan is there. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for the boy, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol.

Jim picked off all of the Choose your answer from: A). ham because he is a vegetarian.. B). pineapple because he is a vegetarian..","completion":"A). ham because he is a vegetarian. Jim picked off all of the ham because he is a vegetarian. He didn't mind the pineapple, as long as the pizza's base ingredients were plant-based. Jim wasn't always a vegetarian; he used to enjoy various meat dishes in his past. However, a life-changing experience, during a visit to a local animal farm, transformed him into an ardent vegetarian. Jim's decision to go vegetarian was inspired by a cow on that farm named Molly. For an unknown reason, Jim felt an overwhelming connection with Molly, often finding himself doubling back to the farm just to see her. It wasn't long before he began spending hours there, bonding with Molly and the other animals. This experience opened his eyes to the beauty and sensitivity of animals, shaking the foundation of his previous beliefs. After becoming a vegetarian, Jim faced several challenges in adapting to his new lifestyle. The first few weeks were particularly tough; his body craved the taste of meat, while his heart ached with guilt for indulging. Despite the struggle, Jim found solace in cooking, exploring new vegetable-based dishes that satisfied both his taste buds and his new ethical convictions. In recent months, Jim had discovered an increasing number of restaurants that catered to vegetarian and vegan clientele. This, combined with a growing community of people who shared his beliefs, provided Jim with the support and encouragement he needed to persevere. He had even adopted a rescue dog, named Luna, who inspired him to start an online community for animal lovers and activists. On the night the group of friends ordered the Hawaiian pizza, they were excited about their monthly get-together. The night had begun with laughter and storytelling, a much-needed escape from the stresses of everyday life. However, it wasn't long before the conversation shifted to Jim's decision to stop eating meat. With each friend expressing their opinion on the matter, the atmosphere surrounding their cozy table began to change. But instead of allowing the conversation to dissolve into a heated debate, Jim adeptly navigated the territory of differing beliefs, sharing his own experiences and knowledge while maintaining an open mind. He spoke passionately about the environmental and ethical implications of eating meat, citing numerous sources and scientific studies to support his claims. The room was silent as his friends listened intently, surprised by the depth of Jim's convictions and his ability to articulate them. As the evening wore on, and the last slice of pineapple-topped pizza disappeared, a newfound respect for Jim's beliefs began to take hold in the hearts of his friends. Despite the varying opinions still present, they left that night's gathering inspired to learn more about vegetarianism and the impact of their own dietary choices on the world. From that day forward, Jim's friends began incorporating more vegetarian meals into their own lives, some even adopting the lifestyle entirely. These changes rippled through their circle of friends and families, gradually spreading awareness and compassion. In the end, removing the ham from that single Hawaiian pizza acted as a catalyst for change in the lives of those present that night. Thanks to Jim and his unwavering devotion to his beliefs, a powerful message of love and understanding triumphed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Starting with the internet spoofs, social media was abuzz with various memes and adaptations of Kim's provocative cover for Paper Magazine. People wasted no time in editing the original image or creating their own versions from scratch, making fun of the reality star's attempt to \\"Break the Internet.\\" This phenomenon quickly gained momentum and, as it spread across the internet, it reached celebrities as well. Taking inspiration from the widespread internet phenomenon, Ellen Degeneres and Portia de Rossi decided to join in on the fun by featuring a clever spoof of Kim Kardashian's Break the Internet photos on their Christmas card. In the card, Ellen and Portia's faces are photoshopped onto Kim's body, adding a humorous touch to the whole idea. Following the internet spoofs and the Christmas card, supermarket ASDA jumped on the bandwagon by producing their own version of the infamous photoshoot to promote their budget-friendly £10 champagne for the holidays. In their ad campaign, a Kim Kardashian lookalike is seen striking the same pose with a champagne coupe resting on her bottom, and the champagne spraying over her head and into the glass. This reinvention by ASDA highlights the popularity and impact Kim's Paper magazine cover had on social media and popular culture. Her bold photograph managed to grab everyone's attention, and even though the intention might not have been to promote a supermarket's champagne, it opened up opportunities for businesses like ASDA to capitalize on the buzz surrounding the photoshoot.

The model chose to act in a movie rather than a commercial because the OPT: 1). movie paid more money.; 2). commercial paid more money.;","completion":"The model chose to act in a movie rather than a commercial because the movie paid more money. The decision to opt for the movie over the commercial was a well-thought-out one, taking into account various factors that would impact not only the model's financial situation, but also their career trajectory, personal preferences, and the potential benefits in terms of exposure and opportunities. One of the primary reasons behind this decision was the financial aspect. Movies often have bigger budgets and pay better than commercials; this holds especially true when considering a lucrative film project with a star-studded cast, a high-profile director, or a well-established production studio. In such cases, the remuneration offered to the model could be significantly larger compared to that of a commercial, even one that airs for an extended period of time. Apart from the difference in monetary gains, the model likely considered the career growth and opportunities that would result from being part of a successful movie. Acting in a film could provide the model with valuable connections and networking opportunities within the entertainment industry, while also helping them to broaden their skill set as an actor. Gaining experience in a full-length feature, as opposed to a brief commercial spot, would also allow the model to showcase a more diverse range of acting abilities, which could open doors to more significant roles in the future. Furthermore, the model may have found the creative challenge of acting in a movie more fulfilling than starring in a commercial. Film projects often carry more interesting and varied plotlines and character arcs, making them an attractive prospect for a model looking to delve deeper into the world of acting. Such projects also offer a chance to work for extended periods with other talented professionals, including actors, directors, writers, and crew members, which can lead to a more rewarding work environment. Exposure also plays a significant role in the decision-making process. A well-received movie with huge box-office success can generate more buzz, media coverage, and recognition than most commercials. This increased visibility could help the model gain more attention from fans, critics, and other industry professionals, ultimately contributing to the model's overall brand value and popularity. Lastly, the model might have considered the issue of longevity. While commercials can have a shorter lifespan due to their nature, a movie has the potential to be remembered and celebrated for years to come, granting a sense of permanence to the model's contribution to the entertainment landscape. In conclusion, the decision for the model to act in a movie over a commercial was likely motivated by a confluence of factors such as financial rewards, career growth, personal fulfillment, increased exposure, and the prospects of creating a lasting impact. By choosing the higher paying movie opportunity, the model not only ensured better financial compensation but also improved their chances of building a more robust and enduring acting career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Either out of confusion or discomfort we sometimes express our feelings in an unclear way. One key to making your feelings clear is to realize that you most often can shorten them in a few words: hurt, glad, confused, excited, angry, and so on. In the same way, with a little thought you can probably describe very briefly any reasons you have for feeling a certain way. In addition to avoiding too long expressions, a second way to prevent confusion is to avoid _ your feelings by saying \\"I'm a little unhappy\\" or \\"I'm pretty excited\\". Of course, not all feelings are strong ones. We do feel degrees of sadness and joy, for example, but some communicators have a tendency to downplay almost every feeling. Do you? A third danger to avoid is expressing feelings in an indirect or coded manner. This happened most often when the sender is uncomfortable about showing his or her feeling in question. Some codes are verbal ones, as when the sender hints more or less subtly at the message. For example, an indirect way to say \\"I'm feeling lonely\\" might be \\"I guess there isn't much happening this weekend, so if you're not busy, why don't you drop by?\\" Such a message is so indirect that chances are small that your real feeling will be recognized. For this reason, people who send coded messages stand less of a chance of having their feeling understood and their need met. Finally, you can express yourself clearly by making sure that both you and your partner understand that your feeling is centered in a specific set of environments rather than being indicative of the whole relationship. Instead of saying \\"I hate you\\", say \\"I hate you when you don't keep your promises\\"'. Rather than \\"I'm bored with you\\", say \\"I'm bored when you talk about your money.\\" Question: The writer points out that if we express our feelings in a coded manner _ Options: A: we will make them harder to be understood B: we will feel all the more confused C: we will feel uncomfortable D: we will make the listener uncomfortable Answer:","completion":"A: we will make them harder to be understood"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Colorado, CDC probing 10 cases of virus-related paralysis in kids U.S. health officials are investigating at least 10 cases of children in Colorado who developed limb weakness or paralysis after testing positive for a respiratory virus, state health officials said on Monday. Of the 10, four children tested positive for Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a virus that is causing severe respiratory infections in 40 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. From mid-August to September 26, 2014, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 277 people infected with the virus, according to the CDC website. Dr. Larry Wolk, chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said some of the children have been ruled out for Enterovirus D68 infection and others are awaiting test results. All of those experiencing limb weakness have recently been diagnosed with either some form of enterovirus or rhinovirus, two large classes of common viruses that cause respiratory infections. The common cold, for example, is caused by a rhinovirus. \\"Just because it's not specific for D68 doesn't mean it's not another, similar virus,\\" Wolk said. \\"There is a very high number of kids who have viral respiratory illness this time of year,\\" he said, adding that limb paralysis is \\"a rare complication of all of these viruses.\\" The CDC is investigating the cases and asking other states whether they are also are seeing higher than normal cases of limb weakness associated with a respiratory virus infections, according to its website. \\"It's obviously not just D68 in and of itself,\\" Wolk said. \\"The question is, is there something else that ties these 10 cases together.\\" All of the children in the Colorado cluster are under 21, and most live in the Denver area. Of those involved, six have been discharged from the hospital. Nine of the 10 were treated at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora.

Xbox One: A family-focused console that goes beyond gaming It certainly makes an impression. The box looks mammoth, and is bigger than its predecessor, the Xbox 360, and Sony’s competing PlayStation 4. Its beefy, almost aggressive exterior screams power rather than style. That’s not to say the console’s textured shell doesn’t look good, but it’s certainly not going to win any prizes for portability. That’s probably fine with Microsoft, which has done everything in its power to indicate that this device should be the immovable foundation of home entertainment. Not only does the Xbox One come with a suite of available entertainment apps, including Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, the NFL, and ESPN, it also plays live television by way of a hookup to a cable box. Microsoft built in a programming guide, aiming to keep users from ever switching their TV input away from the console. Users can pin their favorite apps to their personal homescreens, and the Xbox One will support up to 16 logged-in users at once. In addition to video apps, the Xbox One shows off its pedigree as a Microsoft product with its own branded music and video apps as well as SkyDrive for photos and Skype for videoconferencing. Skype, particularly, is an interesting and promising addition to the console; the app uses the camera on the Kinect controller and can follow users around the room and adjust its zoom based on how many voices it hears. That’s certainly not the only trick the Kinect has up its sleeve either — in fact, it contributes most of the factors that may persuade consumers to opt for the Xbox One despite the fact that it’s 100 more than the PlayStation 4. Microsoft has built the entire console around its motion and voice controller, meaning that users can speak to the console to open apps, control video and even record games as they play. The current Kinect is much more sophisticated than its predecessor and can log in multiple users simply by reading their skeletal structure or hearing their voice. The included controller is also much better at reading voice commands, although it needs to have things repeated on occasion. Users can get around a lot of repeats by going through a more in-depth setup for the accessory, but it’s still not 100 percent. That said, when it does work, it’s quick and easy — so easy that you’ll probably find yourself talking to your television out of habit, even when the Xbox is not on. All of that is great, but the non-gaming features alone still can’t sell this device. So although it can be easy to overlook the Xbox One’s gaming capabilities, they’re still at its heart. And the specs are everything that you may expect of a next-generation console and well matched against newly released PlayStation 4. Xbox One graphics are smooth and fluid, with responsive game play and few glitches. Microsoft does, however, arguably have a stronger launch lineup of games, bringing heavy-hitters such as “Forza Motorsport 5” and “Ryse: Son of Rome,” which shows the promise and limitations of the Kinect’s potential for gaming. Even here, however, the real “wow” factor on the gaming front comes from the console’s ability to switch in and out of a game in progress. Players can pause to switch apps and come back largely without a hitch, or even opt to play a game while using another app to watch television, for example. As with the rest of the console, the gaming functions are most notable for how they fit into a larger picture of Microsoft’s vision for the living room. Overall, the Xbox One boasts a stronger array of games than PlayStation 4, but that’s an advantage that probably will fade over time. Its greatest utility — and justification for your extra 100— lies in its all-in-one entertainment approach rather than its games alone. The Xbox One will go on sale Friday and costs 499.

Dear President, over the years, I have been entrusted with overseeing discussions related to human rights issues within this Parliament, representing the interests of my political group. Throughout my tenure, I have dedicated myself to ensuring that human rights remain at the forefront of our legislative agenda and political discourse. I have worked collaboratively with members of other political groups, as well as with representatives from civil society and international organizations, to address pressing human rights concerns and develop strategies to protect and promote the fundamental rights of individuals in our jurisdiction and beyond. As a staunch advocate for the promotion and protection of human rights, I have consistently pushed for the inclusion of human rights considerations in every aspect of our parliamentary proceedings – from debates on domestic legislation to discussions on foreign policy and trade agreements. Some of the key initiatives that I have had the privilege of being involved in during my tenure include efforts to combat human trafficking, support for freedom of expression and media plurality, promoting gender equality and women's rights, and advancing the rights of religious and ethnic minorities. Through these initiatives, I have actively sought to constructively challenge existing policies and practices that undermine human rights and have endeavored to promote the development of a human rights-centered approach to governance within our Parliament, both domestically and in the context of our international engagements. Furthermore, I have always placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that our discussions and decision-making processes are informed not only by expert analysis and reliable data, but also by the voices of victims and those directly affected by human rights abuses and violations. By incorporating these perspectives, we can better understand the human impact of our policies and interventions, thereby enabling us to make more compassionate and effective decisions. As I continue in my role, representing my political group in these critical discussions, I remain committed to the core principles and objectives enshrined within universal human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. In honoring these commitments, our Parliament can play a pivotal role in shaping the global human rights landscape, promoting respect for human dignity, and ensuring that the rights and freedoms of individuals are protected and upheld – both within our own borders and across the international community.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Delius was born in Bradford in Yorkshire. He was baptised as \\"Fritz Theodor Albert Delius\\", and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40. He was the second of four sons (there were also ten daughters) born to Julius Delius (1822–1901) and his wife Elise Pauline, née Krönig (1838–1929). Delius's parents were born in Bielefeld, Westphalia, of Dutch origin; the family had for some generations been settled in German lands near the Rhine. Julius's father, Ernst Friedrich Delius, had served under Blücher in the Napoleonic Wars. Julius moved to England to further his career as a wool merchant, and became a naturalised British subject in 1850. He married Elise in 1856.The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, and played for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth (just west of London) between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to the city for Delius to be able to attend concerts and opera.Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so.

Please answer the following question: Article: Western teens share their top tunes Have you ever wondered what kind of music kids across the Pacific Ocean are listening to? Are they crazy about Britney Spears? Do they love the Backstreet Boys? Or do they dance to Eminem? Well, nearly 6,000 teens have taken part in a Teens & Music study, conducted by USA Weekend Magazine last autumn. And the results show what type of music is hot and what is not. It comes as no surprise that hip-hop and rap are the most popular types of music among American teenagers. They began in the mid-1970s, with young black kids in New York, taking music onto the streets. Hip-hop and rap are well-known for the breakdancing that goes with them. The word \\"rap\\" comes from a 1960s slang word for conversation. It is a rapid, slangy rhyme that is spoken rather than sung. Eminem is among the most popular rappers ever to hit the US. His first album \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" topped the American music chart in May 2000. Although about a third of teens in the US showed their support for him, almost as many said that his music was so offensive that they couldn't listen to it. Compared with Eminem, actor-rapper Will Smith is more of a star for the kids. He was awarded the Wannabe Award, on April 12 at Nickelodeon's 16th Annual Kids' Choice Awards. It is an award given to a celebrity whom kids most want to be. Pop music, such as Brittney Spears and the Backstreet Boys has always suited the tastes of the general public. It continues to enjoy support among teens and is second most popular after rap. Third is rock -- music with exciting dance beats and simple lyrics that speak loudly of social problems.

Identify the key information needed: In this case, we need to find out the manufacturer and distributor of firearms based in Madison, North Carolina affected by the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act. 2. Research the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act: The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act was a California state law, enacted in 1989, that banned the ownership, manufacture, and sales of certain types of semi-automatic firearms. It was one of the earliest state-level gun control measures in the United States. 3. Explore firearms manufacturers and distributors based in Madison, North Carolina: Sturm, Ruger & Co., and Remington Arms Company are the two significant firearm manufacturers in the United States. However, looking specifically at Madison, North Carolina, we can find that the Remington Arms Company has a significant presence there. 4. Investigate how Remington Arms Company was affected by the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act: Remington Arms Company, which manufactures and distributes firearms, would have been directly affected by the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act, as it would have restricted sales of some of their semi-automatic firearms in California. This would have impacted their revenue and potentially their overall production rate, necessitating changes in their business strategy in the Californian market.

Daily Mail Reporters. Despite being held captive in Pakistan for five years, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has refused contact with his parents in the four weeks since his release, according to an Army official. The Wall Street Journal has reported Sgt Bergdahl - who started a desk job at the army headquarters on Monday as part of his return to duty - has chosen not to see or speak to his parents. The family have not commented on the situation, and the cause of the tension is not known. Following the controversial decision to trade Sgt. Bergdahl for five Guantanamo Bay detainees, his parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl, appeared at a White House announcement alongside President Barack Obama. The estrangement comes after it was revealed Bergdahl may also receive 350,000 from the US government without paying taxes: 200,000 would be for wages earned during his captivity and 150,000 if he in fact was a prisoner of war, according to Fox News. Money earned while in a combat zone is excluded, per IRS regulations. Bergdahl will also have a sponsor as he returns to work as a 'normal soldier' with a desk job. The sponsor is described as 'a person who's designated, not only for him, but for every soldier in Army North [...] and assists with assimilating into the unit.' The sponsor helps with 'very basic administrative functions,' such '[helping become] a part of the unit, processing records, becoming familiar with the day to day schedule.' Return to duty: This is Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl six weeks ago at his handover by the Taliban to US forces. The US Army said Monday he will return to active duty. Accompanied by President Barack Obama, Jani. Bergdahl and Bob Bergdahl speak during a news conference in the Rose. Garden of the White House in Washington on Saturday, May 31, 2014 about. the release of their son. It has now been revealed they have not spoken to Bowe Bergdahl since his release. In a statement, the Army said that the soldier 'has completed the final phase of the reintegration process under the control of U.S. Army South and is currently being assigned to U.S. Army North, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston (JBSA).' 'He will now return to regular duty within the command where he can contribute to the mission. The Army investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the disappearance and capture of Bergdahl is still ongoing.' According to the New York Times, Bergdahl was in therapy at Fort Sam Houston and will meet with Major General Kenneth R. Dahl, the head of the Army's investigation. Since his return from Afghanistan, Sgt. Bergdahl has been involved in debriefings with his superiors, the paper said. Just last week, a photo of Bergdahl,. smiling and posing with a former senior Taliban official in Afghanistan. was posted on Twitter. The undated. photo, likely taken during Bergdahl’s five years in captivity, was. posted on the social media site on Wednesday by @khorasan3, an account. associated with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Along. with the image were the words ‘#US Solider #Bergdahl with Martyr. #Taliban Leader Badar'udin Haqqani(RH) S/O Shaykh Jalaludin. Haqqani(HA).’ This photo of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, smiling and posing with Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani network in Afghanistan, was posted on Twitter on Wednesday. The. Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) confirmed Bergdahl was photographed next to Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani. network in Afghanistan. The son of Haqqani head Jalaluddin Haqqani, he reportedly handled everyday operations and. was killed in a U.S. drone strike in August 2012, CNN said at the time. Later. @khorasan tweeted a series of messages in which they claimed Bergdahl. was never tortured by the Taliban and only treated with kindness during. his five years in captivity. Former POW Bergdahl was controversially released by the Taliban in May in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees. Last. week it emerged that Bergdahl is being allowed to wander off the Texas base. and while under supervision he has visited a library, a supermarket,. stores and fast-food chains near the camp. Bergdahl alternates between civilian and military clothing and shakes hands with passerby when they recognize him, an Army spokesperson told CNN. The. details have emerged as soldiers who served with Bergdahl before he. left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 revealed to Fox News they have still not been. contacted by military investigators. Questions: A new investigation has been launched to determine whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, deserted his post or went AWOL when he was reported missing in Afghanistan in 2009. The former. soldiers told the news channel they believe the Army has already made up its mind about how Bergdahl ended up in. the hands of the Taliban - and that they believe he deserted his post. But when he was swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees on May 31, President Obama gave him a hero's welcome and said the switch had been prompted by Bergdahl's poor health. 'I think it's very clear he. deserted his post,' Army Sgt. Evan Buetow told FoxNews.com. 'He thought about what he. was doing, he mailed some things home, he walked away and we have. witnesses who saw him walking away. Left out: Former platoon leader and Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, pictured in a previous Fox interview, said he believes the investigators have already made up their mind about what happened. 'And if you’re walking away in one of. the worst, most dangerous areas of Afghanistan without your weapon and. gear, I don’t believe you’re planning on coming back.' Former Army Sgt. Evan Buetow. Of the investigation, Buetow added: 'They've already concluded what they want to be said. They know exactly what happened.' Former. Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant also told Fox News said he had not been contacted by Army. officials - but that here are probably still sworn statements by the. unit's members made after he left the post. 'I. have confidence that they're going to do what’s right,' Vierkant said. 'I just feel this should've happened a long time ago and it should've. been public.' Both Buetow and Vierkant told Fox they believe Bergdahl deserted his unit. Speaking out: Former Army Sgt.

Input: At the age of twenty, young Alleyne, son of Edric, leaves the Catholic abbey where he has been raised intelligent, skilled, and well-liked, though sheltered and naive and goes out to see the world, in accordance with the terms of his father's will. The same day, the abbot banishes John of Hordle for worldly behavior: great appetite, teasing, and flirting. At the Pied Merlin inn, they make friends with veteran archer Sam Aylward who has returned to England from France to recruit for the White Company of mercenaries. Aylward has brought a request for Sir Nigel Loring of Christchurch to take command of the company. Aylward and John continue to Christchurch, while Alleyne detours to visit his older brother, the socman or landlord of Minstead, whose fierce reputation has grown to wickedness. The brothers meet for the first time since Alleyne was an infant and Alleyne finds that his brother is still furious their father gave three hides of land (80 120 acres) to the monastery for the boy's support. The socman threatens a lovely maiden, Maude, who escapes with Alleyne's aid and they flee on foot to find her horse. Maude makes a striking impression on the abbey-raised young man. When she hears that Alleyne intends to rejoin his friends to approach Sir Nigel Loring, Maude laughs. Alleyne meets up again with Aylward and Hordle John, and the three friends meet Sir Nigel and his formidable wife Mary. Alleyne is taken on as squire to Sir Nigel and as tutor to his daughter, who Alleyne discovers is the same Maude he saved from his evil brother. When the men eventually depart for France, the young couple admit their love, but only to each other. En route to Gascony, our heroes destroy pirates, then report to the court of the Prince of Wales in Bordeaux. After adventures fearful and funny, the valiant fighters lead the White Company to join the Prince.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Breast cancer chemo raises heart risks ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- New research shows the adage \\"what doesn't kill us makes us stronger\\" doesn't apply in treating breast cancer. A study published in the October 9 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology has found certain treatments that cured breast cancer made women more susceptible to heart disease. \\"We always felt the benefit of savings lives outweighed the risks and were just part of the accepted cost,\\" says Pamela S. Douglas, M.D., chief of cardiology at Duke University and co-author of the JACC paper. But with the success of treatment and growing survivor numbers, Douglas and her colleagues are urging doctors to take the long view when deciding on a woman's breast cancer treatment. First treat the cancer, but don't forget about cardiovascular health down the road. The spike in heart disease risk comes from a variety of sources. Chest radiation, lack of exercise during treatments and stress are all part of the heart-hurting connection. But according to Douglas, the greatest damage comes from a breast cancer treatment mainstay --chemotherapy. Specifically, researchers are looking at chemotherapy medicines called anthracyclines. These compounds are used to treat a variety of cancers, including leukemia, lymphomas, uterine, ovarian and breast cancer. They are also known to harbor a well-known risk: They weaken some women's hearts. \\"There are other drugs that are less harmful, and we know a little bit about how to lower the doses\\" says Douglas, but it's too soon to start completely overhauling breast cancer therapy, she says. Instead, doctors and organizations including the National Breast Cancer Coalition are calling for more research into cancer treatments to see whether other drugs might yield the same result without the added long-term risk. Douglas also stresses that it is important to look at all the factors surrounding a woman's condition, as patients are \\"taking hits from multiple places.\\" While the cancer therapy might be one source of added cardiovascular risk, diet, weight and family history also play a major role. Her advice to patients who learn they have breast cancer, \\"First get cured!\\" But she adds: \\"Take seriously the consequences that dieting and regular exercise can have for your health while taking something that is not necessarily heart healthy.\\" Her words offer a stark reminder that treatment for cancer is still a careful balancing act of medicine working together with lifestyle.

Read this and answer the question Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because, besides being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal. Uranium is also a reproductive toxicant. Radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation, the primary form of 238U decay, has a very short range, and will not penetrate skin. Uranyl (UO2+ 2) ions, such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds, have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals. While the CDC has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium, exposure to uranium and its decay products, especially radon, are widely known and significant health threats. Exposure to strontium-90, iodine-131, and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure, but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons. Although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities, those deaths were associated with the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and uranyl fluoride rather than with uranium itself.

Q:Background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: The cord will spin and untwist itself.","completion":"The given statement refers to the tendency of a cord, rope, or any type of flexible, elongated material, to autonomously counteract any twisting motion or forces acting on it. When subjected to a twisting force or when coiled or wound tightly, cords or ropes tend to develop internal tension. This tension builds up within the fibers or strands of the material, causing them to become twisted. However, these materials generally possess a natural resilience, which compels them to return to their original, untwisted state. As a result, when the twisting force or restraint is removed or loosened, the cord will spontaneously spin or rotate in the opposite direction to the applied force. This rotation can occur rapidly or gradually, depending on the intensity of the twist and the characteristics of the cord material. The process of the cord spinning and untwist itself is influenced by a few factors. Firstly, the composition, strength, and flexibility of the cord material play a vital role in determining its ability to resist and recover from twisting. Tougher materials with greater tensile strength and elasticity are more inclined to untwist rapidly, whereas weaker or more rigid materials may not possess the same capacity to revert to their original form. Secondly, the degree of twisting also impacts the untwisting process. A cord subjected to mild twisting will generally untwist itself more easily than one which has been tightly wound or coiled. This is because the internal tension and the subsequent strain exerted on the fibers or strands is significantly greater in the latter case, requiring more time and effort for the cord to untwist. Lastly, environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, can also affect the cord's ability to untwist itself. In extreme temperatures, the material's flexibility may be compromised, hampering its ability to untwist and return to its original state. Similarly, moisture or dampness can weaken the fibers or strands of the cord and hinder its untwisting action. In summary, the statement \\"the cord will spin and untwist itself\\" highlights the natural propensity of cords and similar materials to counteract twisting forces and independently return to their untwisted, original state. This phenomenon is influenced by the material properties, the degree of twisting, and the environmental conditions to which the cord is exposed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons) per year. Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions, the Gulf of Suez, and the Nile Delta. Egypt has huge reserves of gas, estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres (520 cu mi), and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries. In 2013, the Egyptian General Petroleum Co (EGPC) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest, Reuters has reported. Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas (LNG) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer, while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand, said EGPC chairman, Tarek El Barkatawy. Egypt produces its own energy, but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What efforts were made in 2013 to maintain sustainability?","completion":"In 2013, Egypt took several steps to maintain energy sustainability and to address the growing demand for electricity. These efforts can be broadly categorized into five areas: improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of renewable energy, securing alternative energy supplies, policy changes, and international collaboration. 1. Improving energy efficiency: Egypt sought to enhance energy efficiency through various mechanisms, such as upgrading the electricity grid and implementing energy-saving initiatives. This involved upgrading power plants, promoting energy-efficient lighting, and encouraging public awareness of energy conservation practices. 2. Increasing the use of renewable energy: Egypt has abundant solar and wind resources, and in 2013, the government made considerable efforts to harness these for sustainable energy production. This included launching large-scale projects, such as the 200 MW solar power plant in Kom Ombo and the 220 MW wind farm in the Gulf of Suez. Additionally, the Egyptian government set a target to generate 20% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. 3. Securing alternative energy supplies: Given the pressure on Egypt's oil and gas reserves, the country aimed to diversify its energy mix by securing alternative energy supplies. In 2013, the Egyptian government signed agreements with Qatar for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to address the domestic energy crisis and meet peak demand during the summer months. 4. Policy changes: The Egyptian government implemented several policies aimed at maintaining energy sustainability in 2013. These included the reduction of natural gas exports, and encouraging major industries to slow output during peak demand, as well as promoting annual factory maintenance schedules. Additionally, the government sought to reform energy subsidies by gradually reducing them and allocating funds to more sustainable energy projects and infrastructure improvements. 5. International collaboration: Egypt worked closely with international organizations and foreign governments in advancing its energy sustainability agenda. Collaboration involved sharing expertise, securing financing for renewable energy projects, and building partnerships to increase the exchange of knowledge and technology. Examples include working with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) on financing renewable energy projects and collaborating with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on implementing energy efficiency programs. In conclusion, in 2013, Egypt undertook various efforts to maintain energy sustainability through improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, securing alternative energy supplies, implementing policy changes, and collaborating with international partners. These measures aimed to address the country's energy challenges and support the growing demand for electricity, while ensuring a more sustainable energy future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The doctor gives both men information about what medication to take and what they need to do to manage their diseases. Hint: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer.

How is \\"This will be done in a few minutes.\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"\\"This will be done in a few minutes.\\" translates to \\"Tämä tehdään muutamassa minuutissa.\\" in Finnish. It's important to note that Finnish, like many languages, has a different grammatical structure from English. 1. \\"Tämä\\" is the Finnish word for \\"this\\". It acts as the subject of the sentence. 2. \\"tehdään\\" is the passive form of the verb \\"tehdä\\", which signifies \\"to do\\" or \\"to make\\". Finnish often uses the passive voice where English would use the active. The Finnish passive is a way to indicate that an action takes place without specifying who is performing that action, which is why it's used in the translation. 3. \\"muutamassa\\" is the word for \\"in a few\\" or \\"within\\" and is in the inessive case. The Finnish language has a complex case system with 15 noun cases. The inessive indicates location or time. 4. Lastly, \\"minuutissa\\" is the word for \\"minutes\\" is also in the inessive case to indicate \\"within\\". So, \\"muutamassa minuutissa\\" is saying \\"within a few minutes\\". Of course, like with any language, direct translations are rarely perfect.

Last year, the NCAA gave back former Penn State coach Joe Paterno's football wins, vacated following the Jerry Sandusky child-abuse scandal. But so far the iconic bronze statue of the beloved coach that was removed from outside Beaver Stadium in 2012 remains hidden in a \\"secure location\\" Penn State fans and the late coach's family may soon be able to see new replica statues that look nearly identical to the original. Paterno's upraised right hand, originally cast in a \\"Number One\\" gesture, will now be a defiantly clenched fist. Yesid Gomez and Wilfer Buitrago, two cousins who did the casting work on the original Paterno statue based on a sculpture by Reading artist Angelo Di Maria, said Sunday they are hard at work in a secret location in the Lancaster County borough of Ephrata, creating two brand-new statues - this time with no approval from Penn State, the Paterno family or Di Maria. One of the replicas will be donated to the Paterno family and the other will be displayed for Penn State faithful at various locations. \\"Penn State should have given us the courtesy of contacting us when they removed the statue and letting us know where it is,\\" Gomez told Philly.com. \\"Instead, they are not responding to us, so we decided to bring the statue back again.\\" Di Maria, contacted Sunday, declined to comment on the new statues. The original statue, 7-feet tall and weighing nearly 1,000 pounds, was commissioned by Paterno friends in his honor. It was installed outside the stadium in 2001 with bas-relief sculptures of football players mounted to the wall behind the statue, also designed by Di Maria. All were removed after the Sandusky scandal, with then-Penn State president Rodney Erickson saying the statue had become a \\"source of division and an obstacle to healing\\" would be a \\"recurring wound\\" to all child-abuse victims if it were to remain. This time, Gomez and Buitrago are self-financing the 100,000 project. After giving one statue to the Paternos, they intend the second to travel to Beaver Stadium \\"for all the fans and the people that bleed blue and white\\" and to different locations and museums around the country. Neither artist has spoken to the Paterno family or to Di Maria, who also holds the copyright on the original design. Gomez said that doesn't concern him. \\"If I were going to be worried, I wouldn't be making it,\\" Gomez said. Requests for comment about the new statue from Penn State and the Paterno family weren't immediately returned. Gomez said finishing the clay sculpture should take about another month and that it will take about four to five more months to cast it in bronze. Gomez estimates it will cost 50,000 each to create the two statues. \\"At this point, we don't have a sponsor,\\" said Gomez. \\"We're not worried about money, we're worried about making a statement.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"During a speech in Pittsburgh, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump inquired about the late Joe Paterno, the former Penn State coach who passed away in 2012.

One day, Mr. Ghali decided that Egypt needed some changes. He wanted to create jobs so that people could have enough money to live and families could be happy. He also wanted to make sure that the prices of things didn't go too high so that everyone could afford them. That was the plan called \\"reform.\\" Guess what? It worked!

There was another group called the World Bank that looks at countries to see if they are doing good things for their people. They found out that 17% of Egyptian people didn't have enough money, and that they were living in poverty. Living in poverty means not having enough food, clothes, or a warm and safe place to sleep. 17 out of 100 people were struggling, and that was not a happy thing.

Carla, a lonely woman burdened by lack of respect from her co-workers and her only friend, Annie, begins to change after a younger man enters her life. Carla is introduced immediately with a shot of her putting in her hearing aids. She is an overworked and under-appreciated secretary for a construction company, ridiculed behind her back by her co-workers who do not know she is deaf but despise her homely appearance and subservient position. After she faints from exhaustion she accepts the boss's offer to hire an intern to lighten her load. The first applicant to be her assistant, Paul, is an ex-convict who is not technically qualified to be Carla's assistant, but she hires him. Paul's affable nature and \\"bad boy\\" spirit relieve Carla's loneliness and open up new possibilities for her.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the highest temperature ever recorded in °C of the country with a predominantly temperate climate? The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.

As the wreckage is inspected, Master Sergeant Sam Harper, one of the burnt bodies within, springs to life and kills a sergeant and a major, and returns to an inert state after muttering, \\"Don't be afraid, it's only friendly fire!\\" Weeks later, Sam's body is delivered to his hometown of Twin Rivers, which is preparing for Independence Day. Sam's wife Louise is given custody of the casket containing Sam's remains, which are left in the home of Sam's estranged sister Sally, who lives with her patriotic young son, Jody. Sam reanimates in the early hours of the Fourth of July, and proceeds to kill and steal the costume of a perverted Uncle Sam. Sam then makes his way to a cemetery, where he murders two of three juvenile delinquents who had vandalized tombstones, and desecrated an American flag. During the Independence Day celebration (which a corrupt congressman is visiting) Sam beheads the third delinquent, kills Jody's teacher (who had opposed the Vietnam War) with a hatchet, and shoots Sally's unscrupulous lawyer boyfriend in the head. Despite these deaths, the festivities continue, but are thrown into disarray when Sam uses the fireworks gear to blow up the congressman, and a flagpole to impale Louise's deputy boyfriend. As this occurs, Jody is told by his mother and aunt that his supposedly heroic idol Sam was in fact an alcoholic psychopath who physically and sexually abused them, and only joined the military so he could get a \\"free pass\\" to kill people. Jody is told by Barry, another boy who has established an unexplained mental link with Sam, that the undead Sam is responsible for the deaths.

A: Possible answers: + heat loss + tension + vibration + friction A:","completion":"The effect of bodies sliding over rough surfaces primarily causes friction. Here is how I deduced that: 1. Friction is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another. It is caused when two surfaces rub against each other. It depends on how rough the surfaces are and how much they are pressed together. 2. Heat loss can be an effect of friction, as friction between two surfaces produces heat due to kinetic energy loss as heat. 3. Tension usually applies to stretched ropes or cables, not to bodies sliding over rough surfaces. 4. Vibration is often the result of an applied force or a sudden impact, but not necessarily the direct result of bodies sliding over rough surfaces. So, taking the above points into consideration, the primary cause due to bodies sliding over rough surfaces is friction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where could you find a fox hunting when not in a forest? Possible A: open meadow, arctic tundra, beach, great outdoors, england Why is \\"open meadow\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Open meadow\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to a type of habitat where foxes can often be found hunting for food when not in a forest. A meadow is a large, open area of grassyland that may contain various plants and small wildlife. Foxes, being opportunistic predators, take advantage of the availability of small mammals, birds, and insects inhabiting these grassy fields. The open nature of meadows allows foxes to use their keen senses of hearing and smell to locate prey effectively. The other possible answers, while somewhat related to places where foxes might be found, are not as closely aligned with human common sense related to fox hunting behavior: 1. Arctic tundra: Although the Arctic fox can be found in the tundra regions, this answer is less aligned with human common sense because it refers to a specific subspecies of fox native only to very cold environments. The question asks for a general fox hunting location other than forests so it could be less applicable to common fox species such as the red fox. 2. Beach: Foxes can occasionally be found near beaches, but this is not a typical hunting environment for them. Beaches usually lack the vegetation and diversity of small prey found in forests and meadows, so it's less expected for foxes to be hunting there regularly. 3. Great outdoors: While this term encompasses meadows, forests, and other natural environments, it is a very broad and vague term. It doesn't offer specific information related to fox hunting behavior or habitat like \\"open meadow.\\" 4. England: This is a geographical location and not a habitat type. While foxes, particularly the red fox, might be found in England, it doesn't provide any information about the specific environment they would be hunting in when not in a forest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Italy Boss Antonio Conte Takes the Reins at Chelsea this Summer As the 2015/16 football season draws to a close, Chelsea supporters have something to look forward to. After much speculation, Italy's national team coach, Antonio Conte, has been officially appointed as the new head coach for the London-based club. Set to take over the reins from interim manager Guus Hiddink, Conte's tenure will commence this summer, following the conclusion of Euro 2016. Antonio Conte, who has played as a midfielder in the past, has an impressive coaching career that has seen him transform various clubs into champions, and his most notable achievements include a remarkable stint with the Italian football powerhouse, Juventus. With his well-earned reputation for constructing solid and aggressive teams, Chelsea's management has expressed their confidence in Conte being able to create new records and rejuvenate the club, which had a rather disappointing 2015/16 season. Conte's appointment comes at a time when Chelsea, one of the most successful English clubs in recent years, is going through a rough patch. They find themselves in a precarious mid-table position after having won the Premier League title just last season under the tutelage of renowned Portuguese manager Jose Mourinho. However, a disastrous start to the 2015/16 campaign saw Mourinho leave the club in December 2015, leading to the appointment of Guus Hiddink as the interim manager. With his appointment as the head coach, Antonio Conte has become the fifth Italian manager in the history of Chelsea Football Club. Chelsea's management, in an official statement, expressed their delight at having been able to acquire the services of a reputed manager like Conte, who was also courted by several other big-name clubs in Europe. Chelsea Director, Marina Granovskaia, highlighted Conte's achievements in her statement, saying, \\"We are very pleased to have recruited one of the most highly regarded managers in world football, and we are equally pleased to do so before the end of the current season. This aids our future planning.\\" Chelsea's management is hopeful that Conte's tactical prowess and man-management skills will help stabilize the club and guide them back to their previous heights, competing for major titles both at home and in Europe. As Conte prepares for Euro 2016 with the Italian national team, he will undoubtedly have his sights set on both immediate success in France and long-term plans for Chelsea. Fans of the Premier League club will eagerly anticipate the arrival of their new head coach and the beginning of a new era at Stamford Bridge. In conclusion, the appointment of Antonio Conte as Chelsea's new first-team head coach signifies a significant step forward for the club as they look to bounce back from their lackluster season. With a proven track record, tactical acumen, and experience at the highest level, Conte is well-equipped to steer the club in a new and successful direction. Only time will tell if he can replicate his Italian achievements on British soil, but the future seems bright for Chelsea."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Emergency crews received more than 500 calls, with Lancaster and Galgate the worst affected places. Roads were shut and rail services suspended by floods in north Wales and snow is forecast across Scotland. There are currently five flood warnings in place in the north west, which forced rail services to run at a reduced speed. More than 30 properties were pumped out and a number of people rescued from vehicles in parts of North Yorkshire. The Met Office said around 1.7in (4.3cm) of rain had fallen in 24 hours in parts of Lancashire, with United Utilities saying rainfall had reached \\"unprecedented levels\\". Lancaster University's weather station said it has recorded its highest ever rainfall total. In the 24 hours from 09:00 GMT Wednesday the station at Hazelrigg said 73.6mm of rain had fallen - the highest level in more than 50 years since the centre started weather observations. The levels were higher than Storm Desmond in December 2015 when about 5,200 homes were flooded in Cumbria and Lancashire and 42,000 homes in the Lancaster area lost power after an electricity sub-station flooded. Storm Desmond recorded 59.7mm of rain in a 24 hour period. One lane on the M6 motorway southbound remains closed, between junctions 35 and 36 but the A6 at Galgate has been reopened. Five hundred properties mainly in Blackpool, Thornton-Cleveleys and Poulton on the Fylde coast, are without power due to the weather, Electricity North West confirmed.

A number of schools were shut for the day because of the weather, including Ellel Primary School in Galgate, Moor Park Primary School in Bispham, Royal Brook Primary in Thornton-Cleveleys and Cardinal Allen High School in Fleetwood. People had to abandon their cars and homes were flooded when the River Conder in Galgate burst its banks on Wednesday evening. Lancaster resident Maggie Wild, whose cellar was flooded, said: \\"[I] came home and thought it is pretty high and it is still going to rain all night so I better start moving stuff out of the way. \\"It just came in faster and faster... and there came a point when we were bucketing it out and we had pumps going on it.\\" She said: \\"It was bucket versus river and the river won.\\" She added her cooker, washer, dishwasher boiler were \\"all gone\\". Student Henry Wilson from Galgate said water got up to the top of his thigh - reaching the third step of the stairs in his house. He said water started seeping in the front door… but then \\"flew into the house\\" once it got through the back door. \\"We couldn't believe how quickly it happened.\\" He said it felt like a film with \\"furniture floating about\\". Zak Burnell said the water was waist deep in Limerick Road, Bispham, Blackpool and residents used sandbags from the nearby roadworks. Electricity North West said the weather had caused \\"intermittent power cuts\\" in Preston and Ulverston. The Environment Agency said its staff had been on the ground overnight and will be checking flood defences. \\"Our actions have protected more than 6,000 properties,\\" said Sheena Engineer, national flood duty manager.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve 0 = -49*m + 121*m + 504 for m. What is the solution?","completion":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step, like a super-smart helper! We have the equation: 0 = -49*m + 121*m + 504 First, let's combine the terms with \\"m\\": -49*m and 121*m are together like this: (-49 + 121) * m That is equal to: 72 * m So now the equation looks like: 0 = 72*m + 504 Now, we want to get \\"m\\" all by itself. So, let's move the 504 to the other side of the equation. To do that, we need to subtract 504 from both sides: 0 - 504 = 72*m + 504 - 504 This simplifies to: -504 = 72*m Now, to find \\"m\\", we need to divide both sides by 72: -504 ÷ 72 = 72*m ÷ 72 This gives us: -7 = m So, the solution for \\"m\\" in this math problem is -7.

The Tour de Luxembourg is classified as a 2.HC, the highest rating below the World Tour, by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the sport's governing body. In 2006, the Tour was part of the UCI Europe Tour. Held in late May to early June, the event is sometimes used by riders as a preparation race for the Tour de France. - The Clerve is a river flowing through Luxembourg, joining the Wiltz at Kautenbach. It flows through both the towns of Troisvierges and the town of Clervaux. Upstream of Clervaux, it is known as the Woltz. - Troisvierges is a commune and town in northern Luxembourg, in the canton of Clervaux. The two highest hills in Luxembourg, the Kneiff (560 m) and Buurgplaatz (559 m), are located in the commune. - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite. - The European Court of Justice (ECJ), officially just the Court of Justice, is the highest court in the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the Court of Justice of the European Union it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal application across all EU member states.

Relatively rare until the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the term was often used in the official name of countries smaller than most continental kingdoms of modern Europe (e.g., Denmark, Spain, United Kingdom) yet larger than most of the sovereign duchies in the Holy Roman Empire, Italy or Scandinavia (e.g. Anhalt, Lorraine, Modena, Schleswig-Holstein). During the 19th century there were as many as 14 grand duchies in Europe at once (a few of which were first created as exclaves of the Napoleonic empire but later re-created, usually with different borders, under another dynasty). Some of these were sovereign and nominally independent (Baden, Hesse and by Rhine, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar and Tuscany), some sovereign but held in personal union with larger realms by a monarch whose grand-dukedom was borne as a subsidiary title (Finland, Luxembourg, Transylvania), some of which were client states of a more powerful realm (Cleves and Berg), and some whose territorial boundaries were nominal and the position purely titular (Frankfurt). - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed. - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Strasbourg (; Alsatian: \\"Strossburi\\" ) is the capital and largest city of the Grand Est region of France and is the official seat of the European Parliament.

Summarize this article in one sentence. One of the easiest ways to prevent the infection of skin is to practice good hand hygiene such as washing your hands frequently. Alternatively, you can use hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't available. Wash your hands frequently. After wetting hands and applying soap, rub hands together for at least 20 seconds (or the time it takes to sing \\"Happy Birthday\\" twice). Be sure to rinse thoroughly with warm water. Dry hands using a paper towel or air dryer. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't accessible. After applying the sanitizer, rub hands together until they are dry. Be sure to apply product to all surfaces of the hand including in between fingers. In some public places, such as hospitals and nursing homes, there is often a sanitary station where you can keep your hands clean. These are usually foam-based sanitizers which sometimes have moisturizer in them, too. Utilize these stations when you can. Although washing hands often helps reduce skin infections, it can also lead to dry skin. Dry skin may result in cracks in the skin, which can allow bacteria to enter the cut. Use a moisturizing lotion often to prevent cracks and peeling of the skin. Avoid lotions that have a long list of ingredients including many perfumes and fragrances. Plain moisturizers such as petroleum jelly work best. As a rule of thumb, creamy moisturizers tend to have more preservatives so grease-based moisturizes tend to be more effective. Some germs can survive on surfaces anywhere from hours to days. By avoiding skin-to-skin contact with surfaces like locker room floors and doorknobs, you can decrease your chance of coming into contact with infectious germs. Clean or use a barrier (like gloves or napkins) when touching overly-exposed surfaces. Items like restroom doors, restaurants menus, and cell phones are full of bacteria. Avoiding direct contact with such items can reduce the spread of germs. Sanitize surface areas often by using household disinfectants or wipes such as Lysol. Even though people are taught from a young age that \\"sharing is caring,\\" sharing personal hygiene items or items that come into contact with bodily fluids can often lead to the transmission of germs. Personal hygiene products always contain germs. Avoid sharing items like make-up, hair brushes, towels, and deodorant. Never share toothbrushes or razors. Sharing drinks and eating utensils easily spreads saliva which is a common host of germs. Summary:","completion":"To keep your skin healthy and avoid infections, wash your hands often, use hand sanitizer when needed, moisturize, be careful with shared items, and avoid touching germs on surfaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river. This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash. But I can use this background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. What is an answer for this question: Which ocean would it be harder to catch a fish in? Answer:","completion":"Considering the given background information and the factors affecting both the Malegese Ocean and the Dundrin Ocean, it appears that it would be harder to catch a fish in the Malegese Ocean. The primary reason for this conclusion is the impact of pollution on the Malegese Ocean. The river connected to this ocean passes through Hilda's farm, where excess fertilizers are regularly dumped into the water. These fertilizers contain various chemicals that can have detrimental effects on the marine ecosystem. When they enter the ocean, they can create an excess of oxygen-depleting substances, which in turn can lead to hypoxia and the formation of \\"dead zones.\\" In such areas, fish and other marine life struggle to survive due to the insufficient oxygen levels. Furthermore, the waste from Hilda's farm could potentially contribute to marine debris and beach litter. This human-created waste not only poses a direct threat to marine life through entanglement or ingestion but also indirectly disrupts the ocean habitat and its biodiversity. Such disruptions can drastically impact food sources and breeding grounds for fish, making it increasingly harder to catch fish in the Malegese Ocean. On the other hand, the Dundrin Ocean is connected to several rivers, with most of them flowing through uninhabited and natural areas of the world. This means that the levels of agricultural and human waste entering this ocean are likely lower than in the Malegese Ocean. Additionally, Luke, the one farmer living near the Dundrin Ocean, is mindful of his waste disposal practices and ensures that he does not pollute the surrounding rivers and ocean. His sustainable approach to waste management contributes to the preservation of the local marine ecosystem. With comparatively lesser pollution and better conservation efforts in the areas surrounding the Dundrin Ocean, the marine life there would likely be healthier and more abundant. As a result, it can be inferred that it would be harder to catch a fish in the Malegese Ocean due to the higher levels of pollution and its destructive impacts on the aquatic environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, she must step into her brother's shoes at the height of his career and master a world of performance that she has never dreamed of. Amidst romance, rivalries, and the weight of a public eye, can Go Mi Nyu find her own voice while compensating for her brother's absence? Introduction: Go Mi Nyu (played by Park Shin Hye) leads a modest life teaching children how to play musical instruments at a small Catholic school. Her passion for music is evident in her desire to keep the school's music program afloat, despite budget cuts threatening to shut it down. Elsewhere, unbeknownst to Go Mi Nyu, her estranged twin brother Go Min Seok (played by Jang Keun Suk) finds himself in the limelight as the lead singer-songwriter of the famous rock band \\"Urban Jungle.\\" Inciting Incident: One day, Go Mi Nyu receives a mysterious message from her brother's manager, Mr. Kim (played by Kim Seunggi), urging her to meet at the band's studio. When she reluctantly arrives, Mr. Kim reveals that her brother Go Min Seok has vanished without a trace, only leaving behind countless missed performances and unpaid debts. Begging Go Mi Nyu to temporarily impersonate her infamous twin brother, Mr. Kim insists that she could save the band from collapsing and redeem her family's name in the process. Rising Action: With much hesitation, Go Mi Nyu agrees to step into her brother's shoes, quickly realizing that her strong resemblance to him might not be enough. Facing the challenge of finding her own singing style while simultaneously imitating her brother's dazzling stage presence, she forges new relationships and rivalries among her bandmates. The charismatic lead guitarist, Kang Da Eun (played by Kang Minhyuk), unexpectedly becomes her closest ally and support through the emotional and musical turmoil. As Go Mi Nyu impersonates her brother, she and Kang Da Eun gradually develop a romantic love interest. However, dating a bandmate is strictly forbidden in their contracts, and the threat of the truth coming out puts a strain on both their relationship and the band as a whole. Climax: One day, as Go Mi Nyu and the band finish a successful performance, the manager Mr. Kim informs them that a local talent agency is considering sponsoring the school where Go Mi Nyu teaches music. This opportunity could save the school's music program from shutting down, but requires her presence as a music teacher, not as her brother's imposter in the band. Facing the decision between her growing commitment to the band and her responsibility to her students, Go Mi Nyu ultimately reveals her identity as Go Min Seok's twin sister to the band members. This confession causes the band to be disqualified from the music competition they've been rallying to win. Nevertheless, Go Mi Nyu and Kang Da Eun's love for each other only grows stronger, and the band members stand by her side, promising to help her keep her dream alive. Resolution: In an unexpected twist of events, Go Min Seok returns and unites with his sister Go Mi Nyu to put on a once-in-a-lifetime joint performance for the talent agency. The impassioned performance by both protagonists wins over the agency's hearts, securing a sponsorship for Go Mi Nyu's school and a renewed contract for \\"Urban Jungle.\\" As the movie ends, Go Mi Nyu and Kang Da Eun finally come together as a romantic couple, ready to face the future hand in hand and write the next beautiful melody together."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Add punctuation: Some BKF file extension formats can be opened in binary format only","completion":"Some BKF file extension formats can be opened in binary format only. The BKF file format is commonly associated with backup files created by various Windows backup utilities, such as NTBackup. These files are essentially archives, containing copies of user data, system files, or entire partitions, depending on the backup settings. Opening a BKF file in binary format refers to viewing or editing the raw data contained within the file. This data is typically not human-readable, as it consists of a series of binary code that represents information stored in the file. To open a BKF file in binary format, one can use specialized file editor software, such as a hex editor. These programs enable users to view and manipulate the binary data directly. However, opening a BKF file in binary format is not the typical approach when working with backup files. Most users prefer to open the file using a dedicated backup utility, which will decode and extract the contents of the file for them. These utilities are more user-friendly, allowing users to view, search, and restore the contents of the BKF file without having to navigate through binary data. In conclusion, it is possible to open some BKF file extension formats in binary format, though special software like hex editors will be required for such a task. For most users, working with a backup utility designed to handle BKF files will likely be a more efficient and convenient approach. Regardless of the method chosen, it is essential to handle BKF files carefully, as they often contain critical data that is vital for system recovery or personal file restoration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"dissatisfied"},{"prompt":"Given the question: I have a new situation: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. But I can use this background: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: What is an answer for this question: Would Earth travel shorter or longer distance than Neptune? The answer is:","completion":"Earth would travel a shorter distance than Neptune in their respective orbits around the Sun. This is because Earth is closer to the Sun, resulting in a smaller orbital path compared to Neptune, which is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system and has a larger orbit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63 when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to... The answer is:","completion":"Their son, who had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut. Given the context, the son is likely to be Albrecht Dürer, a well-known German painter.

It is bordered by Togo to the west, by Nigeria to the east and by Burkina Faso and Niger to the north. A majority of the population live on its small southern coastline on the Bight of Benin, part of the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo, but the seat of government is in Cotonou, the country's largest city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of approximately 115,000 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 9.98 million.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who are the three children of the stubborn and stern patriarch? A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired and bicker, but Grug doesn't listen.

On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The sultans raised taxes\\" correctly answer the question \\"What was happening at the same time that the British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration?\\"?

She lives in Seoul, South Korea, and has always dreamt of being a world-renowned artist. However, the competitive art world and the demands of her overbearing parents make it increasingly difficult for her to follow her aspirations. Everything changes when Hye-Yeong wins a prestigious art competition, granting her a one-year residency at an upscale art gallery in New York City. Fueled by excitement and anxiety, Hye-Yeong says goodbye to her parents and sets off on her journey, leaving Seoul and her old life behind. In New York City, Hye-Yeong quickly becomes immersed in the bustling arts scene, where she meets an eclectic group of fellow artists, each with their unique backstory and creative journey. Among them is the enigmatic Aaron, a photographer whose captivating personality and mysterious past draw Hye-Yeong in. As Hye-Yeong navigates the demanding art world and copes with homesickness, her relationship with Aaron blossoms into a deep bond, one forged through shared experiences, vulnerability, and an understanding of the sacrifices they've both made for their art. Aaron pushes Hye-Yeong to question her creative boundaries, encouraging her immense talent to flourish unabated. Hye-Yeong's art soon earns her an audience with esteemed patrons, art critics, and gallery owners, making her the talk of the town. She begins to experiment with new art forms, incorporating elements of Korean culture and her experiences in New York City. Her art pieces connect with people on a profound level, speaking to their emotions and challenging societal norms. But all is not as perfect as it seems. As Hye-Yeong's success grows, she starts to feel the weight of the expectations placed upon her – by her parents, her colleagues, and herself. Long-suppressed memories from her strained relationship with her parents resurface, as resentment she held towards them for their lack of support blends with a newfound guilt for leaving them behind. Moreover, Hye-Yeong uncovers a tragic secret in Aaron's past, which reveals his struggle with substance abuse and solace in his photography. This revelation shakes their relationship, inadvertently sparking jealousy and strain between the two. As Hye-Yeong unravels, Aaron's addiction worsens, and the once fierce creative outlet he presented, the driving force of their connection, now threatens to tear them apart.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead.

When John DeStefano, Jr., became mayor of New Haven in 1995, he outlined a plan to transform the city into a major cultural and arts center in the Northeast, which involved investments in programs and projects other than sports franchises.

Options: - town - forest - countryside - rural area - park The answer is \\"rural area\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"rural area\\" because a rural area is typically characterized by open land, agricultural fields, and sparse human settlements. The presence of a pond surrounded by tall buildings is not consistent with the typical landscape of a rural area. Let's take a closer look at each of the options to better understand why \\"rural area\\" is the correct answer: 1. Town: A pond with tall buildings around it could possibly be located in a town, especially if the town has experienced significant development and urbanization that led to the construction of high-rise buildings. Such a pond could be part of an urban design or be preserved due to historical or cultural significance. 2. Forest: Although it is less likely to have tall buildings in a forest setting, it is not entirely impossible. Some modern architecture or housing developments may incorporate tall buildings into a forest environment, aiming to coexist with nature in a sustainable way. Additionally, such structures might also serve as research facilities or resorts, offering visitors an opportunity to experience the forest in a unique way. 3. Countryside: Similar to the rural area, the countryside is characterized by open land, agricultural fields, and smaller human settlements. However, unlike rural areas, some countryside areas may be closer to urban centers, potentially allowing for more development and the presence of tall buildings, albeit less likely than in a town or city setting. 4. Rural area: As mentioned earlier, rural areas are characterized by their vast open lands and limited human settlements. Due to this, tall buildings and high-rise structures are highly unlikely to be found in rural areas, as there is less demand for such structures and limited infrastructure to support them. 5. Park: A pond with tall buildings around it could be located within a park, especially if the park is situated in an urban or densely populated area. Parks in urban centers often provide green spaces and natural landscapes for local residents to enjoy, and can include ponds, lakes, and water features as part of their design. The tall buildings may be a result of the park being located in a city, where high-rise structures are common. In conclusion, the presence of a pond surrounded by tall buildings is unlikely to be found in a rural area, making it the correct answer. The rural area's characteristic open landscape, limited population, and lack of infrastructure for high-rise buildings make it an unsuitable location for such a scenario. Instead, a pond with tall buildings around it is more likely to be found in urban areas, towns, or parks that are located near cities or other densely populated regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They describe different relationships between Issaquah Creek and Lake Sammamish in the context of a park. Let's examine each sentence in detail to understand the differences. Sentence 1: Issaquah Creek enters Lake Sammamish in the park. This sentence implies that Issaquah Creek is a water body, perhaps a river or a stream, that flows into Lake Sammamish. It further specifies that this confluence, or the meeting point of Issaquah Creek and Lake Sammamish, is located within a park.

Write a title for this article: Retirement security didn’t always feel this out of reach. People worked until their early 60s, earned pensions and collected Social Security. Today, most people expect that they will rely on their own savings, and some worry that Social Security is no longer a sure thing. Workers now need to view the income they earn throughout their careers, which can span 40 years, as money to last them into their 80s and beyond. People stumble with their retirement savings at all stages of life as competing interests — student loans, the cost of having children, health emergencies and home obligations — manage to get in the way. But the cost of putting off saving can be dire: Roughly 40 percent of baby boomers and Generation Xers risk running out of money in retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. It’s a tricky balancing act, and the mistakes that are more likely to make workers stumble will look different depending on whether a person is fresh out of college or at the tail-end of his career. 20s: Focusing too much on student loan debt Some young workers may think it’s smarter to use their meager paychecks to aggressively pay off student loan debt before they start saving for a phase of their life that’s still decades away. But that would mean giving up the biggest advantage they have when it comes to saving for retirement: time. “If you start saving at 22 you need to save half as much on a yearly basis as you would if you started at 32 to get to the same dollar amount,” says Scott Holsopple, managing director of retirement solutions at the Mutual Fund Store, a group of investment advisers. Workers who receive matching contributions from employers should at least save enough of their income to take advantage of that match, says Antwone Harris, a financial planner with Charles Schwab. “That’s just free money” that would otherwise be left on the table, Harris says. They should also set the plan to automatically increase the contribution rate by 1 percentage point each year, says Scott Halliwell, a financial planner with USAA, until they are contributing at least 10 percent. If the plan doesn’t allow for automatic increases, workers should increase their savings rate every time they get a pay raise, he says. 30s: Cashing in retirement savings to buy a house After managing to put away a decent sum for their nest eggs, some people may find themselves tempted to use the cash today. Maybe there are children in the picture, creating the need for more space. And some workers may feel like they can afford a house now that their paychecks are bigger — if they could just finish saving up for that down payment. But by using that money now, some people could be setting themselves up to struggle in their later years, advisers say. “They buy an expensive house instead of a comfortable retirement,” Halliwell says. Tax law allows workers to use their retirement savings to buy their first home, further adding to the temptation. The Internal Revenue Service allows penalty-free withdrawals of up to 10,000 from Individual Retirement Accounts for first-time homebuyers. There are similar allowances for 401(k) plans, but the withdrawal would come with a 10 percent penalty or in the form of a loan that would need to be paid back immediately if a person changed jobs. People who struggled to save for a down payment may have a hard time covering maintenance, taxes and other expenses that arise as a result of home ownership, Halliwell says. And that 10,000 would be worth much more in retirement if it had remained invested where it could grow and compound interest. 40s: Prioritizing the kids’ college The goal here is typically to keep children from taking out loans for college so that they can earn a degree — and the higher pay that comes with it — without being weighed down by debt. But the approach may backfire in the long run if parents are cutting back on their retirement savings to cover those education costs. “As soon as you start decreasing retirement that’s going to be a red flag,” Holsopple says. While there are multiple ways to pay for college, there aren’t as many options when it comes to paying for retirement, advisers say. Some teens may be able to work to cover expenses while they’re in school, Halliwell says. Families can also consider less expensive options, such as state colleges or community colleges that have lower tuition rates than private universities. Plus putting their college education ahead of your retirement now could backfire for both parties. “Eventually they’re going to become a burden to their children,” he says. 50s: Being unrealistic about what retirement will look like With retirement roughly a decade away, workers should start managing their expectations for what they will realistically be able to do in retirement. Some people may find that they need to delay it or take on a part-time job because they haven’t saved enough. “This is where you start focusing on the trade-offs you’re going to face in retirement,” Holsopple says. “This is where you start to evaluate your situation.” Advisers say people should start setting up for their post-retirement jobs in their 50s by building a consulting firm or freelance business that may provide more flexibility and added income in retirement. People in their 50s should also be saving as much as they can, even if they have been saving all along, Holsopple says. That includes saving at least 15 percent of pay and making additional catch-up contributions of up to 5,500 that the IRS allows for people age 50 and up. 60s and beyond: Blowing through the money too quickly Some people mistakenly think that once they stop working their only choice is to draw down on their savings until they run out of money. But pre-retirees and retirees can still make changes that can help their savings last longer. For starters, some people may decide to work a little longer or to take on part-time work so that they can put off the need to tap their retirement savings and can stash more money away. “Just a couple of years of extra work can make a huge difference,” Halliwell says. With life expectancy increasing, retirees should plan on having their savings last another 25 to 30 years, if not more, advisers say. People can boost their income and stretch that money if they keep it invested instead of moving it primarily to cash. Some retirees may invest in a mix of bonds and dividend-paying stocks that can create a stream of income, and some stock exposure may still help boost returns in the long run. “You’re still going to be an investor for another 20 years or more in retirement,” Holsopple says. Retirees should also be flexible about how they draw down those savings and stay open to changing their approach if their savings take a hit, says Luke Delorme, research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research. For instance, someone who withdraws a fixed percentage of savings each year would withdraw less money after a market downturn than someone who takes out a set dollar amount, he says. That could leave them in a better position to recover if the market rebounds because more of their savings would remain invested, he says. People who get 401(k) advice are better savers.

Step 1: Understand the relationship between diameter, area, and resistance As the diameter of the wire (or foil cylinder in this case) decreases, its cross-sectional area would also decrease, since the area is proportional to the square of the diameter. Since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of a conductor, the resistance of the conductor would increase as the diameter decreases. Step 2: Analyze the given diameters of foil cylinders We have two foil cylinders – one with a diameter of 10cm and the other with a diameter of 1cm. Step 3: Compare the cross-sectional area and resistance The foil cylinder with a diameter of 10cm would have a larger cross-sectional area compared to the foil cylinder with a diameter of 1cm. Since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area, the foil cylinder with a diameter of 10cm would have a lower resistance than the foil cylinder with a diameter of 1cm. Therefore, the answer is: A foil cylinder of diameter 10cm likely has less resistance than a foil cylinder of diameter 1cm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"(i)\\" sentiment (Options are: (i) negative; (ii) positive;).","completion":"Title: The Disappointing Sunset As a movie enthusiast, it deeply saddens me to write a negative review on \\"The Disappointing Sunset.\\" While the title itself should have served as a warning, I held on to some hope for an engaging and worthwhile viewing experience. Unfortunately, the film miserably fails to deliver on nearly every cinematic front. From the very beginning, the poorly-paced script plods along, sluggishly weaving together one-dimensional characters and a remarkably unoriginal plot. The dismally linear storyline descends quickly into an abyss of predictability, which ultimately undercuts any emotional investment in the movie's characters or their drawn-out conflicts. In addition to the glaring narrative inefficiencies, the direction leaves much to be desired. Awkward editing choices disrupt scenes, often leaving the viewer confused and disoriented as if the editor were groping for coherence. Moreover, the overall visual aesthetics seem to prioritize style over substance, yet even in the pursuit of style, it falls short, resulting in a distracting and uneven mess. As for the acting, not even the most talented cast could have salvaged something worthwhile from the poorly-written and dimensionless characters with which they were saddled. The performers are given little room to exhibit emotion or depth; instead, they seem confined to caricatures devoid of any believable motivation. Consequently, their interactions consistently come across as forced, superficial, and often cringe-worthy. While a film's score can often elevate a project, the soundtrack of \\"The Disappointing Sunset\\" serves as another missed opportunity. The choice of music appears to be haphazard at best and, at times, downright jarring, as if the composer were entirely disconnected from the story unfolding on screen. The audio cues miss the mark and overshadow moments that could have given the film some semblance of emotional depth. In summary, \\"The Disappointing Sunset\\" is a decidedly underwhelming film that warns viewers not to be misled by its potentially intriguing title. Hindered by a lackluster script, poor direction, subpar performances, and an ill-conceived soundtrack, the movie squanders what little potential it may have had. It is with regret that I cannot recommend this film, for it falls far short of the satisfying cinematic experience most moviegoers rightfully seek."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Damien Gayle. Toronto's controversial mayor Rob Ford last night vowed to have another 'crack' at nixing his city's land transfer tax at his first campaign debate since leaving rehab. The quip provoked raucous laughter from a spirited audience at a church in the Toronto's Scarborough district, which was split between vocal supporters and opponents of the mayor. Seeking re-election after a term marred by scandal, including being forced to admit smoking crack cocaine, Mr Ford faced rival candidates as the race began for October's municipal poll in earnest. Toronto Mayor Rob Ford at a campaign debate in Scarborough, Ontario, last night where he attempted to portray a stellar track record in office as the race begins for the next mayoral election in October. 'I have proven in the last 14 years in government that I’ve watched every single one of your tax dollars,' said the mayor, to a chorus of cheers and jeers, according to Global News. 'I have created jobs, I have worked with youth, nobody’s worked with youth closer than I have ... folks, my record speaks for itself. It’s a record of success, success, success.' Mr Ford, 45, only returned to work a fortnight ago after spending two months at the Greenstone rehab centre in Bala, Ontario. He sought help after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack; Ford admitted last year that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor' after reports of a similar video, following months of denials. Even since returning to the mayor's office, a largely symbolic role after his powers were stripped by the city council, he has admitted that he can't guarantee that he'll never relapse. But Mr Ford's proclivity for crack, a highly addictive derivative of cocaine, seems to have had little impact on his supporters, who booed each time one of his rivals mentioned their man's drug use. Supporters dressed in 'Ford Nation' T-shirts, pins and flags heckled his political opponents and yelled in support each time he spoke on stage. Mayoral contender Olivia Chow, left, applauds during the debate, where she pointed out that, contrary to Mr Ford's assertions to have created jobs, one in five young people in the area are out of work. Mr Ford's opponents came armed with sharp barbs, directly contradicting his claims to have looked after public spending and increase employment. Olivia Chow, of the New Democratic Party, said: 'Mr. Ford, your record is clear: one out of five young people cannot find a job. How is it that Scarborough is booming?' Progressive Conservative candidate John Tory pointed out that two municipal renovations, of Union Station and Nathan Phillips Square, had run over budget. 'Project after project after project, on your watch, when you’re the mayor,' he was quoted by the Toronto Star as saying. 'We know what you were doing — it wasn’t managing the taxpayers’ money!' Mr Ford's activities while in office have earned him global notoriety, something which Mr Tory commented on as candidates left the hustings last night. 'He’s a laughing stock. People all over the world know who Rob Ford is, but they know it in a bad way,' he was quoted by Global News as saying.","completion":"Toronto's controversial mayor, Rob Ford, vows to have another 'crack' at eliminating Toronto's land transfer tax during his first campaign debate since leaving rehab.

Shortly after rejoining Helsingborg, Larsson was signed on loan by Manchester United from 1 January until 12 March 2007, coinciding with the Allsvenskan's off-season. He scored on his debut against Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round on 7 January 2007 at Old Trafford. Larsson scored his first ever FA Premier League goal on 31 January in a 4-0 win over Watford. While United were eager to extend the loan deal, Larsson stated that he had made a promise to his family and his club to return on 12 March. This was confirmed on 20 February, when Larsson announced that he would not be extending his loan period. Despite this, Sir Alex Ferguson was full of praise for the striker, who scored 3 goals in 13 matches in all competitions during his three-month stay, saying, \\"He's been fantastic for us, his professionalism, his attitude, everything he's done has been excellent.\\" \\"We would love him to stay but, obviously, he has made his promise to his family and Helsingborg and I think we should respect that - but I would have done anything to keep him.\\" Larsson scored Manchester United's only goal in their win against Lille at Old Trafford in the Champions League. He made his final appearance for United on 10 March in an FA Cup sixth round tie away to Middlesbrough, ending in a 2-2 draw.

I knew, and could distinguish those two heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other. Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever beheld. Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff. His visage was meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow. I soon discovered that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and had never seen or heard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless, “that these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity.” I introduced Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a poet.

As she is leaving the motel, Wheeler offers her a ride then assaults and handcuffs Stacia while driving. He comes across Walker on the highway, standing in the lane, and brakes to a stop just before hitting him. Walker accepts a ride, and the two bicker and draw their pistols, ready to kill Stacia and each other. Stacia, sitting in the middle, slams on the brakes and sends the two murderous men through the windshield onto the road and causes the truck's cab to fall on its side. Stacia unsuccessfully struggles to get Wheeler's gun, while the wounded Wheeler and Walker fight to determine who will kill her as an ambulance siren sounds.In the end, Wheeler and Walker are side by side in the ambulance, still fighting and cursing at one another.

On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace. He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776. Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights. With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command. After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands.

'Grim fatalism': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says GPs are refusing to send patients for crucial tests to spot dementia because they believe there is no point. GPs are refusing to send patients for crucial tests to spot dementia because they believe there is no point, according to the Health Secretary. Jeremy Hunt blames shockingly low diagnosis rates on a ‘grim fatalism’ among doctors coupled with an ignorance of symptoms. His comments came as figures revealed nearly 400,000 dementia sufferers in Britain have never been given a formal diagnosis. The statistics obtained by the Alzheimer’s Society also found some NHS trusts are spotting only a third of all cases. Mr Hunt said: ‘As with cancer in the past, too many health professionals are not aware of the symptoms. Some even believe that without effective cure there is no point putting people through the anxiety of a memory test – even though drugs can help stave off the condition for several years. ‘It is a grim fatalism we need to shake off. Not just within our Health Service but in society as a whole.’ If dementia sufferers are given drugs such as Aricept and Ebixa early enough, the progression can be slowed by a year – possibly longer. Patients and their loved ones can also be offered vital care and support to help them come to terms with the debilitating illness. But writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Hunt said: ‘It can be a total nightmare getting a diagnosis and the result is that shockingly, only 46 per cent of all dementia cases are identified. ‘Yet with access to the right drugs and support for a partner, someone can live happily and healthily at home for much longer. ‘We should be ashamed that we deny this to so many people in today’s NHS.’ The figures obtained by the Alzheimer’s Society show huge variation in the standards of dementia services across Britain. Not aware of symptoms: Figures revealed nearly 400,000 dementia sufferers in Britain have never been given a formal diagnosis and some NHS trusts are spotting only a third of all cases of dementia. In at least two primary care trusts, Wiltshire and Swindon, patients are being made to wait nine months before being seen at a memory clinic. Experts recommend that if a GP suspects a patient has dementia, they should only have to wait a maximum of six weeks for an appointment at one of these centres. And five NHS trusts are only managing to diagnose a third of all dementia patients. They include East Riding of Yorkshire, Dorset, North East Essex, and Kensington and Chelsea and Harrow in London. Using Freedom of information requests, the Alzheimer’s Society asked every primary care trust and health authority for the numbers of patients diagnosed for dementia last year. They then compared this figure with the estimated number of people likely to be living with the condition to work out what percentage had been diagnosed. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘It’s disgraceful that almost half of all people with dementia are not receiving a diagnosis, and disappointing to see such a disparity in diagnosis rates in different regions of the UK.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"So, kiddo, this big article is about how some doctors don't want to test people for a memory disease called dementia. They don't want to because they don't think there's a way to fix it or cure it. A man named Jeremy Hunt, who is in charge of health stuff in the UK, is upset about this. He says that many people, around 400,000 in Britain, may have dementia but have never officially been told they do. Mr. Hunt also said that certain medicine can slow down dementia if it's given early enough, and he's upset that many people aren't getting tested, and therefore, not getting the medicine they need. This matters because if people know they have dementia early, they can get help and take medicines, which can help them stay healthy and happy at home a little longer. Mr. Hunt thinks it's really important for doctors to test for dementia, even if it's a little scary for the patient, so they can get the help they need. Some places are really bad at testing for dementia, with the worst areas only diagnosing about one-third of all cases.

The answer is:","completion":"In order to build a movie plot around the given question, we must first establish the setting, characters, and key story elements. Here's a step-by-step plot development based on the given information: Step 1: Establish the setting The story takes place in the culturally rich and vibrant city of Mumbai, India, where traditional music is highly valued. Our protagonist, Christian, is a young and ambitious musician from a small town who has recently arrived in the city to follow his dreams. Step 2: Introduce the main characters - Christian: A talented but inexperienced sitar player seeking to make his mark in the music world. - Zidler: A charismatic and highly influential music producer who has an uncanny ability to identify and nurture talented musicians. - Riya: A beautiful and talented singer in Zidler's troupe who has a magnetic stage presence and becomes the love interest of Christian. Step 3: Outline the main conflict Christian is determined to join Zidler's prestigious music troupe to gain fame and recognition, but he lacks the experience and connections needed to do so. To overcome his apparent obstacles, Christian disguises himself as an anonymous sitar player and slowly gains Zidler's attention with his incredible talent. Step 4: Develop the romantic subplot As Christian increasingly becomes closer to the troupe, he falls in love with Riya, who is unaware of his true identity. Their relationship starts to blossom, with Christian appreciating her passionate art and Riya admiring his dedication. Step 5: Build tension and climax During a highly-anticipated performance, one of the troupe's lead sitar players falls ill, and Christian, still disguised, is asked to take his place on stage. Relying on his natural talent, Christian gives a stellar performance and the audience is mesmerized. Backstage, Riya starts to suspect that Christian is the masked sitar player after hearing him hum a familiar tune. Step 6: Zidler's revelation Intrigued by the mysterious player's skill, Zidler starts to investigate his background. The climax occurs when Zidler gathers the troupe together and dramatically reveals that Christian is the disguised sitar player. The troupe members, including Riya, are shocked by the revelation. Step 7: Resolve the conflict Initially feeling betrayed by Christian's deception, Riya confronts him and demands an explanation. Christian tells her about his impossible dream and the challenges he faced, winning her sympathy and understanding. Zidler recognizes Christian's talent and dedication, and decides to give him a chance, formally welcoming him into the troupe. Step 8: Conclude the story The movie ends on a high note, with Christian's hard work and passion finally paying off. The troupe gives a grand performance, with Christian and Riya performing a beautiful duet that leaves the audience in awe. Their shared love for music ultimately proves that the power of art can overcome any challenge. In summary, the plot of the movie revolves around Christian, a talented sitar player who disguises himself to pursue his dreams and gain recognition from Zidler. Following the twist of Zidler revealing his true identity, Christian is accepted into the troupe and allowed to pursue a future with Riya, illustrating that dedication and passion can lead to success."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

British island territory swaps marriage for domestic partnerships for LGBT couples in move criticised as attack on equal rights Bermuda becomes first jurisdiction in the world to repeal same-sex marriage Bermuda has become the first jurisdiction to legalise and then repeal same-sex marriage, in what critics have called an unprecedented rollback of civil rights by the British territory. Bermuda’s governor has signed into law a bill reversing the right of gay couples to marry, despite a supreme court ruling last year authorising same-sex marriage. Walton Brown, Bermuda’s minister of home affairs, said the legislation signed by Governor John Rankin would balance opposition to same-sex marriage on the socially conservative island while complying with European court rulings that ensure recognition and protection for same-sex couples in the territory. Bermuda’s Senate and House of Assembly passed the legislation by wide margins in December and a majority of voters opposed same-sex marriage in a referendum. “The act is intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in Bermuda, by restating that marriage must be between a male and a female while at the same time recognising and protecting the rights of same-sex couples,” said Brown, whose ruling Progressive Labour party proposed the repeal. Australia's first same-sex weddings – in pictures Read more LGBT civil rights groups said domestic partnerships amounted to a second-class status and it was unprecedented for a jurisdiction to take away the legal right to marriage after it had been granted. “Governor Rankin and the Bermuda parliament have shamefully made Bermuda the first national territory in the world to repeal marriage equality,” said Ty Cobb, director of Human Rights Campaign Global. “I feel enormously disappointed,” said Joe Gibbons, a 64-year-old married gay Bermudian. “This is not equality, and the British government has obviously just said, ‘This is not our fight.’” About half a dozen same-sex marriages that took place in Bermuda between the supreme court ruling in May 2017 and the repeal will continue to be recognised under the new law. But same-sex couples will now have the option only of a registered domestic partnership. Brown said those couples would had “equivalent” rights to married heterosexual couples, including the right to make medical decisions on behalf of one’s partner. Human rights groups had lobbied Rankin and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to deviate from standard practice in self-governing UK territories and withhold assent for the change. They argued that the new legislation contradicted Bermuda’s constitution, which guarantees freedom from discrimination. In a debate in the UK’s House of Commons last month, the Labour MP Chris Bryant called the bill a “deeply unpleasant and very cynical piece of legislation”. After the repeal was confirmed, Bryant tweeted that it would “undermine [the] UK effort to advance LGBT rights”. Chris Bryant (@RhonddaBryant) So @BorisJohnson has granted permission to Bermuda to abolish same sex marriage. This totally undermines UK effort to advance LGBT rights. The supreme court ruling on marriage equality in May 2017 was celebrated by Bermuda’s small gay community, but it also outraged many on the socially conservative island, including church leaders, and thousands protested outside parliament. Having signed his assent, Rankin declined to comment beyond a brief statement: “After careful consideration in line with my responsibilities under the constitution, I have today given assent to the Domestic Partnership Act 2017.” Mark Pettingill, a Bermudian lawyer who won the May 2017 marriage equality case in the supreme court, had previously said he might challenge the governor’s decision through a constitutional action.

Threatened with frostbite and pneumonia, he is coerced into divulging intelligence to his German interrogator.He and many other Americans are later transferred by train to a prisoner of war camp. While en route, a flight of P-51 Mustangs attack the station. Since the painted letters POW on the top of the train are covered by thick snow, the Mustangs fire on the train, causing some of the POWs to be killed by friendly fire. To save themselves, the POWs leave the train, spell POW with their bodies, and prevent further strafing.After arriving at the camp, Hart is debriefed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie, since he knows Hart was held for three days after seeing only a Level 1 interrogator. He does not reveal this to Hart and sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers.Two Tuskegee Airmen are brought to the camp, Second Lieutenants, Lincoln A. Scott (Howard) and Lamar T. Archer (Vicellous Reon Shannon). They are the only blacks in the platoon, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sergeant Vic W. Bedford (Cole Hauser), a vicious racist, is their primary antagonist.Later, a spike from the fence, which could be used as a weapon, is found in Archer's bunk.

Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) is known for its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1 Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively.

Write a text based on \\"pit bulls costly for humane society\\" Text:","completion":"Title: The Rising Cost of Pit Bulls for Humane Society: A Growing Concern Introduction The Humane Society, a non-profit organization dedicated to advocating for animal welfare, faces a challenging situation due to the overwhelming number of pit bulls requiring their services in recent years. The costs associated with rescuing, rehabilitating, rehoming, and promoting awareness for pit bulls have skyrocketed, leaving the organization with limited resources to address the needs of other animals. The issue has become more than just a financial burden, as it also demands creative solutions to efficiently and effectively address the pit bull crisis while still attending to their core mission. Issues Surrounding the Growth in Pit Bulls The increase in the population of pit bulls can be attributed to several factors: 1. Overbreeding: Irresponsible breeding practices have led to a surplus of pit bulls, with some breeders prioritizing profit over the health, temperament, and well-being of the animals. 2. Dogfighting: Despite being illegal, dogfighting still occurs in many areas, with pit bulls often used as a primary breed. Criminals exploit these dogs for their power and aggression, resulting in a negative reputation and severely traumatizing the animals involved. 3. Misinformation and breed stigma: Pit bulls face a unique set of challenges due to the public's misunderstanding of their temperament and behavior. Many assume them to be naturally aggressive or dangerous, leading to reluctance to adopt or understand their needs. The Financial Burden on the Humane Society The high influx of pit bulls in need of rescue and rehabilitation has left the Humane Society grappling with unprecedented costs. These expenses extend beyond basic care and include: 1. Veterinary care: Given the rough conditions in which many rescued pit bulls are found, they often require extensive medical treatment for physical injuries, infections, and other health issues. Additionally, the cost of spaying and neutering increases with the growing pit bull population. 2. Behavioral rehabilitation: A significant number of pit bulls come from abusive or neglectful backgrounds and need specialized care to help them become adoptable. This involves additional time, expertise, and resources for training and socialization, further straining the organization's budget. 3. Adoption initiatives and public education: With an increase in pit bulls in shelters, the Humane Society invests more in adoption initiatives to rehome these animals. Furthermore, they engage in public education campaigns to dispel stereotypes and stigma around the breed. Implications for Other Animals and the Organization The financial strain caused by the high costs related to pit bulls has severe consequences on the Humane Society's ability to help other animals. The resources allocated to the care and rehabilitation of pit bulls may at times mean assistance for other species is compromised. The organization's staff may also experience fatigue and emotional distress due to the intense demands of managing the pit bull crisis, which could affect their capacity to serve the broader animal community. Potential Solutions and Recommendations To address the overpopulation and financial burden of pit bulls on the Humane Society, it's essential to tackle the root causes of the problem: 1. Implement stricter regulations on breeding practices to prevent overbreeding and encourage responsible practices. This may involve government intervention, licensing requirements, and penalties for breeders not complying with ethical standards. 2. Strengthen efforts to combat dogfighting and hold abusers accountable through stronger legal consequences, collaboration with law enforcement, and awareness campaigns highlighting the inhumane nature of the practice. 3. Advocate for community-wide educational campaigns that promote understanding of pit bulls, challenge stereotypes, and emphasize responsible pet ownership. Conclusion The growing cost of pit bulls for the Humane Society demands urgent action to address the factors contributing to their overpopulation and subsequent impact on animal welfare organizations. Through a combination of public education, policy changes, and advocacy, the Humane Society can continue to fulfill its mission while also creating a sustainable approach to managing the pit bull crisis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where could you see a sloth that is not real? Options: - bad dream - picture book - another place - universe - zoo The answer is \\"picture book\\" because The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"picture book\\" because it specifically refers to a type of medium in which you can see or experience depictions of real or imagined animals, people, or scenarios through visual representations. Picture books offer a unique way of seeing the world and make it easy for anyone, regardless of age, to engage with and learn about various subjects, including the sloth, which is an animal native to the rainforests of Central and South America. A bad dream can undoubtedly feature a sloth or any other creature, but it is not necessarily the best or most common place to experience a non-real sloth. People's dreams are highly unpredictable, and we usually have little control over the content in them. Also, as a negative experience, a bad dream is not exactly an ideal setting to learn or enjoy a creature like the sloth. While another place, the universe, and the zoo are all technically locations where you could see various animals or objects, they do not give specific information about where or how to view a non-real sloth. A zoo, as a leading example, would typically showcase living, real sloths rather than fake or artificial ones. Another place is a broad term, and without any context or additional information, it is hard to pin down a particular location where you could see a sloth that is not real. Although there might be exhibitions or museums that feature representations of a sloth, the provided option is too vague and unspecific to offer a meaningful answer. The universe, as an even more open-ended and all-encompassing term, offers unlimited possibilities but not a particular setting in which you could see a sloth that is not real, primarily because it encompasses all things in existence, making it a less satisfying and meaningful answer to the question. Considering all the given options, a picture book remains the most coherent, relevant, and specific choice as a place where you can see a non-real sloth. With beautifully crafted art and visual storytelling, picture books provide an accessible way for individuals to learn about various animals like the sloth while appreciating their uniqueness and habitats.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Old habits are hard to break, and emotional triggers can fall into that category. To avoid and change a trigger, you'll need to replace some old habits and activities with new ones. You'll also need to avoid those circumstances that have proven to be triggers. For instance, if you know someone who gets belligerent when drunk and pushes a multitude of your triggers, stay away from that person when they're consuming alcohol. If not having enough money to pay your bills creates a trigger, then look at what you can cut from your budget. Avoid alcohol and other drug use. When you're under the influence of either substance and encounter a trigger, you won't have as much control over your emotions and your outbursts. Sometimes a time-out can help you calm down before re-engaging with a situation. You can use this time to think about the emotions you're experiencing and how to address them effectively. Try saying \\"I need some air\\" or \\"I'll get back to you on that.\\" If someone tries to follow you, say \\"I really need to be alone right now.\\" For example, if you are angry with your coworker and you don't want to harm your working relationship, you could say \\"we'll discuss this later\\" and walk away. You can write a note saying that you don't want to be disturbed, put it on your office door, and go inside. Then you can take the time to figure out whether and how to respond to her. Staying away from things that trigger you works in the short run, but it might not work in the long run. Avoiding triggers all the time can be stressful, and it may limit your life. Start small, and work your way up. Continue until you have successfully managed your emotions to the point that the experience is no longer a trigger. Take baby steps towards your goal. For example, perhaps you are afraid of crowds. Your first step might to briefly spend time in a crowded cafe or mall, and then leave and do something that calms you. Don't try to jump in headfirst. For example, if you are afraid of cats, don't lock yourself in a room with a cat right away. Perhaps step 1 is watching someone else pet a cat, or watching cat videos and learning more about cat body language so that they seem less unpredictable to you. Habit and lifestyle changes don't typically have immediate results. It may take weeks or months before you start noticing a change. This is normal, and it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. Set small goals. For example, if you tend to freeze up around a verbally abusive mother, step one might be learning how to say \\"I'll get back to you\\" and leaving the room. Don't punish yourself for not being able to ignore her yet. You have to master step 1 before you can handle step 5 or step 10. Reward yourself for making progress. Even if it's small progress, tell yourself that you did a great job, and be proud of yourself. Give yourself a physical reward (like a movie night or extra time to work on a hobby) if you'd like. Making progress is a big deal, so be proud of yourself!

News article: A former U.S. Marine officer from Carlsbad, just north of San Diego, crushed the world record for the longest plank Saturday, raising money and awareness for wounded warriors in the process. Former Marine officer and retired Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent George Hood, 57, spent a total of five hours, 15 minutes and 15 seconds in the abdominal plank position at the Junior Seau Amphitheatre in Oceanside as he broke the Guinness World Record previously set at four hours and 26 minutes by Mao Weidong of Beijing, China, last September. Before Weidong took the title, Hood held the planking record at four hours and one minute, which he set in June 2014. The athlete and fitness professional’s planking feat – dubbed “The People’s Plank” – doubled as a fundraiser to benefit the Semper Fi Fund for injured U.S. service members, a charity that’s near and dear to Hood’s heart. “There are injured Marines that come back from the fight, who have suffered life-altering injuries and the discomfort that I feel right now pales in comparison to that which they feel,” Hood told NBC San Diego while in mid-plank. “So, we raise money to help them. We tend to forget about them sometimes. This helps raise awareness and draw attention to them – and I’m about that,” he added. Hood said two of his sons are also Marine officers, so this event held extra special weight for him. Hood – who is a personal trainer and group exercise instructor – said his longest plank while training for this challenge had clocked in at four hours and 33 minutes. In the end, he beat his own training time by more than 42 minutes on Saturday. Hood spent nine months training for his record attempt all over the North County, including four to six hours of training per day and 30 hours of plank time each week. In all, he logged nearly 1,000 of plank time leading up to the record-breaking event, consistently training with 20 and 40-pound weights on his back to build up his endurance and strength. Hood had an entire crew there to help him achieve his goal, including friends who chatted with him while he planked and brought him visual distractions. “They chat amongst themselves. They plant ideas and themes in my head that causes me to get distracted,” he explained. “They bring little gifts up here to the table that I can stare at and draw conclusions, and just study them. All that helps pass time.” After his record-breaking endeavor, Hood planned to grab some lunch with his support team. Hood said he would likely burn about 2,000 calories planking for that many hours. “I will lose some weight today and I will be very, very sore. But we will achieve our mission,” Hood said. The former Marine hoped his event would inspire others to put fitness first and, most importantly, remind people of our U.S. service members who have given so much in the fight for freedom. “Don’t forget our countless Marines and service members who’ve fought the good fight, those who haven’t come home, and those who are injured and living with that horror every single day,” he said. “Don’t forget about them.” In addition to the plank record, Hood first attained Guinness World Record status in 1986 when he skipped rope for more than 13 hours. From 2007 to 2010, the athlete set three additional records for the spin cycling marathon. ||||| We don’t know too many people who get excited about doing planks. Generally, you stare down your timer as the minute (or more) runs down. And while we’re being candid, let’s just come out and say it: Planks destroy your abs. For a pretty basic isometric exercise, planks strengthen your entire body—they make your core pop, strengthen your lower back, and build your shoulders. Better yet, you don’t need any equipment, and you can amp-up the intensity by widening your stance and bracing yourself with your hands instead of your forearms and elbows. See for yourself. Check out what Keith Scott, A.T.C., C.S.C.S., a strength coach in Medford, N.J., recommends for conquering the plank before you attempt any heavy-weight exercise. You’ll be better for it, guaranteed. Get into pushup position on the floor Now bend your elbows 90° and rest your weight on your forearms. Your elbows should be directly beneath your shoulders, and your body should form a straight line from your head to your feet. Hold the position for as long as you can. Your goal should be to hold it for two minutes. \\"The plank helps develop strength in the core, shoulders, arms, and glutes,\\" says Scott, making it a great prerequisite for lifting heavy weights or playing intense sports. Even though you aren't moving or lifting weight, you have to constantly squeeze your abs to hold the position—most people can't last 30 seconds on their first attempt. Ways to improve your plank time The longer you can hold the plank, the more resilient your lower back will be to injury, and the better your abs will look once you burn the fat off them. Follow these tips for longer plank times. Practice: Perform planks several times each day, trying to hold the position a little longer each time. Use bodyweight exercises: Pushups and pullups will improve your core strength. Squat and deadlift: Guys who are strong in these specific lifts find planks are no problem. Hold it If you don't have the core strength yet to do a regular plank, you can build up to it by doing a bent-knee plank. If you can hold a plank for more than two minutes with ease, you can move on to these tougher variations. Lift one leg up. By simply raising one leg in the air, you dramatically increase the demand on your core to fight your body's natural urge to rotate. Lift one arm up. Again, your body will want to fall to one side. Don't let it. ||||| Try ad-free for 3 months Sign up by October 31st for an extended 3-month trial of YouTube Red. |||||  Ultra endurance athlete George E. Hood did not disappoint Saturday. The 57-year-old former Marine and fitness trainer obliterated the world record for holding the longest abdominal plank position, doing so for five hours and 15 minutes. The “planking” record, set last fall by a Chinese police officer, had been four hours and 26 minutes. Hood accomplished his feat before hundreds of supporters who gathered around the stage at the Oceanside Pier amphitheater. People had been coming by all day to offer encouragement and gawk in wonder at Hood. By 2 p.m., as he approached the record, the ovation grew thunderous and continued off on for the next 50 minutes. “I’m a little sore and a little stiff,” Hood said minutes after finally stopping. “My feet and upper body are pretty sore, actually the whole body. It’s a total body exercise.” He said he was inspired throughout the ordeal by the crowd and the amplified rock music that had been blasting from speakers. As he broke the record, Hozier’s “Take Me to Church” blared. “We were changing lives today,” Hood said. “That’s what it’s about.” The planking event was for charity – the Semper Fi Fund for injured veterans. The grimaces and look of extreme pain on the face of the Carlsbad resident were obvious during the planking marathon. A support crew talked to him almost constantly throughout and applied ice water to his aching arms. But not once did his form deviate as he balanced his rigid body on his forearms and toes. Hood already had held three world records for the plank in the past but he was upstaged last fall in China. He’s also held other Guinness World Records for jump roping and spin cycle riding. A large digital clock kept track of the time, but the crowd was asked not to tell Hood what was going on. “A mind over matter thing,” Crew member and event Master of Ceremonies Staci Coyer said. He was told when he had broken the record, but then just kept on going. “George doesn’t know how to stop, which is OK,” Coyer told the appreciative crowd. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A former U.S. Marine officer and retired Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, George Hood, has set a new world record for the longest plank, holding the position for an impressive five hours, 15 minutes, and 15 seconds in aid of raising money and awareness for wounded warriors.

Police say the dead men were among a group of more than 100 smugglers who were challenged when they were cutting down trees in the remote forests near the popular pilgrimage town of Tirupati in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. They said when asked to hand over the logs, the woodcutters refused and attacked the police with axes, sticks and stones in two separate areas of the forests. Police say they acted in self-defence. Now India's National Human Rights Commission has ordered an investigation into the 7 April killings after hearing the testimony of two witnesses. According to the families of the seven men, four of them worked as painters and masons. The other three worked as a plumber, a tailor and an assistant in a small catering business. The mother of one of the victims, Magendra, says her son, was a plumber and was even pursuing an distance learning degree in economics. He had also applied for the post of police constable. Magendra, according to Chitra, was 22 and worked in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, and had \\"never worked in the forests before\\". Thirty-eight-year-old Murugan was a painter and father of two who would travel to nearby towns for work and earn 300 rupees (4.8; Â£3.2) a day, says his family. \\"A few months ago, he told me to stop working. He told me that he would take care of me,\\" his father Manickam said. The family is landless. Sasikumar, another victim, was a painter, says his family. Although he owned two acres of land, a drought had forced him to leave the village and look for painting jobs, his father Annamalai said. He even went to Malaysia to work for two years before returning in 2009 to get married. The couple had two children, aged two and four. Palani Velu, 34, was a tailor who had taken a shop on rent, where he would earn 200-400 rupees for stitching a pair of shirt and trouser. He told his family that he was going to buy buttons and thread and, according to eyewitnesses, ended up on the bus which was stopped by the police. \\"Why should he put his life in danger by going to the forests? His wife had given birth to his first child just over a month ago,\\" says his mother Sambhanu. Perumal's family said he worked as a mason, and that he had never been to Andhra Pradesh. Muniswamy's family said he was a mason earning 300 rupees a day, and had told his family that he was leaving for a \\"job\\" on the fateful day. \\"Next thing I knew was he had been killed,\\" his widow, Thanjiammal said. And Murthy's family said he worked in a small catering company. The families insist that none of them had ever gone to a forest to work. A journalist who has reported on the incident says the victims all come from some of the most impoverished villages in Tiruvannamalai district in Tamil Nadu. There are two hilly areas populated by poor tribes people, who are in great demand as woodcutters. \\"These villages are in the throes of severe economic crises. There's little water, no industries, no jobs and the farms are often parched. Many of the men are taken to work outside in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh by agents who come here and lure them away with promises of better paying jobs,\\" he says. \\"Often they are not told what the job is and they only discover it on reaching the destination. These men may have travelled to the forests before to cut wood in the past, but had not told their families. Or they were being taken there for the first time. That is not clear.\\" However, he says, what is clear is that the victims were not smugglers, but had been hired by a gang to cut red sandalwood. Sandalwood smuggling is rampant in southern India, with a ton selling for tens of thousands of dollars on the international black market. What is also clear is there is a \\"huge demand\\" for workers from Tamil Nadu to cut wood for smuggling groups in Andhra Pradesh. There are some 3,000 people from Tamil Nadu lodged in prisons in Andhra Pradesh on smuggling charges, by one estimate. But nobody still knows how the seven men ended up in the woods dead, shot by the police. And rights groups say there are still too many unanswered questions over the killings. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Seven men from Tiruvannamalai district in India were killed in a police encounter while they were allegedly cutting down trees in a remote forest near Tirupati.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Tremors 4: The Legend Begins Context: In 1889, the inhabitants of Rejection (later Perfection) are completely dependent on the income from a nearby silver mine. One day, ahot spring causes Graboid eggs to hatch, resulting in the death of 17 miners. Hiram Gummer, great-grandfather of Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and the mine's owner, arrives in town to fix the problem. After Graboids attack his camp one night, he is shocked by their presence. One of his companions, Juan, kills one with a pickax, and the pair escapes. Inexperienced and not fond with firearms, Hiram calls for a gunfighter, Black Hand Kelly (Billy Drago). Hiram and Kelly do not get along well, though Kelly succeeds in conveying to Hiram some of his attitude towards firearms and life in general. Eventually, Kelly is eaten alive but not before discovering that a total of four Graboids have hatched. Hiram decides to abandon Rejection and leave the townsfolk to their fate. However, they force him to give them the silver mine, threatening to alert potential buyers to the danger if he sells it out from under them. In Carson City, Hiram hears a telegram revealing that the fully-grown Graboids have made it through the pass and are headed for the town. Changing his mind, he buys weapons, heads back to Rejection to lead a last stand against the Graboids, and helps the town ready itself. After two Graboids are killed, the third and final one adapts and avoids all of the traps. Hiram tricks it into coming to the surface and then attaches it by the tail to the wheel of a steam traction engine. The Graboid is reeled in and slammed against the wheel with such force that it is explosively decapitated on impact. With the creatures dead, the town decides to keep them secret out of fear that no one would settle in the area if their existence was known, and use the proceeds from the mine to pay for their belongings. Hiram settles in Rejection, building his home in the same place that his great-grandson Burt's would one day be. He is also given a Colt 1865 Gatling gun and begins target practice, enjoying it.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Rat The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: The Secrets of Whispering Wharf Genre: Mystery, Adventure, Drama Plot: Act I: In the quiet coastal town of Whispering Wharf, an air of mystery surrounds the sudden disappearance of a well-known marine biologist named Samuel Kristofferson. Samuel had dedicated his life to studying and protecting marine life, as well as advocating for environmental conservation efforts. He had just recently discovered a rare marine ecosystem off the coast of Whispering Wharf, which could have tremendous implications for the scientific community and the locals. However, the discovery threatened the financial interests of some local fishermen and wealthy businessman-turned-politician Alexander Stone, who wanted to exploit the valuable coastal waters for their own gains. The townsfolk were torn between supporting Samuel's cause and their loyalty to Alexander, who promised prosperity and jobs through his business ventures. As the town grapples with Samuel's disappearance, a skilled detective named Laura Hart arrives from the city to investigate the case. She starts by talking to Samuel's closest friends, family, and colleagues, including his sister Emily, who desperately seeks answers about her brother's whereabouts. Act II: As the investigation gains momentum, Laura uncovers suspicious activities of Alexander Stone, including bribes to the local fishermen, and his involvement in illegal fishing practices. She also encounters a group of enigmatic individuals, the Silver Rats, who are rumored to live in the shadows of Whispering Wharf and are known to have sources of information all over the town. Having gained the trust of the Silver Rats through cunningness and wit, Laura gets an unexpected lead from one of them, a Rat informant nicknamed Whiskers. Whiskers approaches Laura to confess Samuel's location, revealing he had been secretly captured by Alexander's goons to keep him from unveiling the illegal activities happening in the town, and that they have been blackmailed into remaining silent. Act III: Laura, accompanied by some rebellious Silver Rats and Samuel's sister Emily, embark on a daring nighttime mission to rescue Samuel from his captors, who have been holding him in a secluded and heavily guarded warehouse by the harbor. During the rescue, Alexander Stone is identified as the mastermind behind the illegal activities, and the townsfolk are alerted to his deceit and true intentions. In the end, Samuel is set free, and his discoveries are publicized at a global level. The Silver Rats, initially feared by the townsfolk, are recognized for their help in unveiling the truth, and promises are made to integrate them into society. Alexander Stone is arrested for his crimes, and Whispering Wharf begins a new era where environmental conservation is deeply valued and protected. Samuel and Emily reunite, strengthened by their bond and commitment to their cause.

If \\"A girl is playing the violin in the street while her band mate on the guitar is talking on her cellphone with a confused look.\\", can we conclude \\"People have musical instruments outdoors.\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the statement, \\"A girl is playing the violin in the street while her band mate on the guitar is talking on her cellphone with a confused look,\\" it is reasonable to conclude that \\"People have musical instruments outdoors.\\" The sentence provides evidence that at least two individuals, the girl playing the violin and her bandmate playing the guitar, are utilizing musical instruments in an outdoor setting, which is the street. This conclusion can be further supported by examining different aspects of the given statement: 1. Outdoor setting: The sentence confirms that the action takes place \\"in the street.\\" Streets are generally outdoor public spaces where people might gather, travel, or perform various activities, including playing music. In this case, the presence of the two musicians with their respective instruments suggests that people do carry and use musical instruments outdoors. 2. Musical instruments: The statement specifically mentions the violin and the guitar, which are two distinct types of musical instruments. Both are commonly used in various music genres and can be effortlessly transported and played outside. Their presence in the street, as described in the statement, further establishes that people have musical instruments outdoors. 3. The musicians: The girl playing the violin, along with her bandmate on the guitar, indicates that there is more than one person involved in the outdoor musical act. This provides an example of at least two people engaging with musical instruments outdoors, which again supports the notion that people may use musical instruments outside. 4. The activity: While the girl actively plays the violin, her bandmate seems to be momentarily occupied with a phone call. However, the fact that the statement identifies her as a bandmate suggests that she is also engaged in some form of musical performance or practice in the street. This indicates that various activities, such as playing an instrument or taking a break for external matters, can occur during outdoor music performances. In conclusion, based on the information in the given statement, it is valid to conclude that \\"People have musical instruments outdoors.\\" The presence of the two musicians with their respective instruments in the street, along with the context and activities described in the statement, collectively demonstrate that people engage with musical instruments in outdoor settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most typical five-month-old babies can't crawl, let alone drive, but an experimental buggy has given some lucky children the chance to steer their own robot. Designed by researchers at Ithaca College in New York to assist babies with disabilities, the WeeBot encourages children to move around independently using the pint sized scooter. Built from a motorised base, a booster seat and a Nintendo Wii balance board, the WeeBot was developed to stimulate the cognitive functions of children suffering from conditions such as cerebral palsy or Down syndrome. Scroll Down for Video. The baby at Ithaca College in New York takes the WeeBot through its paces. Intended for children who are unable. to crawl because they suffer from a mental impairment, the WeeBot is. supposed to grant independent mobility to infants and kick start their. development. 'In. typically developing infants, the initiation of independent locomotion. heralds concomitant development in aspects of communicative, emotional,. perceptual, cognitive and social behaviour,' states a study produced by. the research team at Ithaca College. 'Typically. developing children whose mobility has been restricted for even. relatively short periods of time have been found to demonstrate. apathetic behaviour and depressed motivation,' states the study. At. the moment though, the robots encourage children with disabilities to. move around independently, at exactly the same time that other. five-month-old infants have learned to crawl. However, one of the scientists in the research team which created the WeeBot has said that the device is in fact only a developmental aid for children and parents should always encourage their child to walk. 'For children who are typically developing we would encourage parents to support their child's 'natural' development, because at each stage of motor development, children develop strength and skills that help them master the next developmental steps,' said Carole Dennis Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy at Ithaca College. 'That said, we don't think that robot experience in and of itself would stunt development (unless children weren't provided sufficient experiences for typical movement development). 'My colleagues (Sharon Stansfield and Hélène Larin) and I think that it might actually increase the motivation of children to move. One child leans to the left to grabs a paper bag they find interesting while another child is offered a firurative 'carrot' to move towards the researcher. It is movement which some childhood specialists believes encourages mental development, as children seek out new environments for their brain to make sense of. 'We think that babies with disabilities are missing an opportunity for learning that typically developing babies have,' said Carole Dennis to Yahoo. Previously, researchers had focused on providing babies with joysticks, however, the WeeBot relies on the baby simply leaning in the direction that it wants to travel. 'What I think is exciting is that we're pushing the age envelope much and much younger,' said Maria Jones, a professor of physical therapy at the University of Oklahoma who was not part of the WeeBot research. The research team at Ithaca were driven on by findings of past research which indicate that developing children undergo dramatic mental changes when they start to move by themselves. However, some children with disabilities do not begin to learn to explore their environment until they are three-years-old. The WeeBot built by Ithaca College to enable disabled children to experience movement and learning and therefore increase their development. 'We know the brain is aching for exploration,' said Cole Galloway, a physical therapist at the Univeristy of Delaware who is an expert in robot maneuverability devices for infants. 'It we treated a typically developing kid the way we treat these kids, it would be as it we put these kids in a closet of cage until they can take adult commands,' said Galloway. To create the WeeBot, Dennis teamed up with physical therapist Héléne Larin and computer programmer Sharon Stansfield. The Wii board part registers shifts in weight to the left or right or forwards or backwards depending on how the child leans. A child is encouraged to lean forward thereby making the WeeBot move forward as trials for the Nintendo Wii board equipped device continued. The Ithaca team added sonar-style instruments to the front and back of the WeeBot to halt the children running into obstacles. The team discovered after a little training, 90 percent of able bodied infants could successfully control the device. And then children with disabilities were given trial runs to see they would react. One, a seven-month-old boy with Down syndrome only used the WeeBot satisfactorily nine-percent of the time, while a 15-month old with cerebral palsy became 85-percent proficient in use of the device. The Segway was the first self-balancing electric powered transportation machine and was introduced in 2002. Researchers believe that the WeeBot needs more trialing before they can think about a cost-effective manufacture, especially in its safety features. However, the researchers believe that the WeeBot genuinely aids in the development of mentally disabled children and will push to see them put into production. 'Some parents of typically-developing infants that we have worked with have mentioned that their children seem to be a bit frustrated when they aren't in the WeeBot, because they can't move,' said Carole Dennis. 'So the realization that there is a great world out there to explore might increase children's desire to get moving!' What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"The article discusses the development of an experimental robotic device called WeeBot, designed by researchers at Ithaca College in New York to assist babies with disabilities. The main points highlighted in the article are as follows: 1. The WeeBot is a motorized scooter that helps babies with disabilities learn to move independently, promoting their cognitive skills and other aspects of development. The device is particularly helpful for children suffering from conditions like cerebral palsy and Down syndrome. 2. The WeeBot is equipped with a Nintendo Wii balance board that allows the user to control the movement of the scooter by simply leaning in the desired direction. 3. The device has demonstrated promising results in test trials. After some training, 90% of able-bodied infants could successfully control the WeeBot, and children with disabilities also showed great improvement. 4. Researchers believe that the WeeBot can aid in the development of mentally disabled children, as it provides them with greater opportunities for exploration and interacting with their environment. 5. The WeeBot is still in development and requires further trials and refinements, particularly regarding its safety features, before considering mass production. 6. The research team emphasizes that the WeeBot is not intended as a replacement for traditional mobility development, but rather as a complementary developmental aid for children with disabilities. Parents are encouraged to continue supporting their children's natural development alongside the use of the WeeBot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What do you think about starting a tech company as a non-tech founder?","completion":"Although these two questions seem similar at first glance, they carry slightly different meanings and address different concerns. While both questions relate to starting a tech company without being tech-savvy, they approach the topic from different angles. The first question, \\"Would I have to be tech-savvy to start a tech company?\\" is focused on the necessity or prerequisites of being proficient in technology to establish a tech company. This question is seeking a more definitive answer regarding the importance and indispensability of technical skills when entering the tech industry with the intention to own and operate a tech business. The second question, \\"What do you think about starting a tech company as a non-tech founder?\\" assumes the scenario where someone with limited technical skills is considering starting a tech company. This question prompts a more open-ended response by asking for thoughts and opinions on the scenario. The answer could include addressing potential challenges involved, ways to overcome hurdles, and advice or recommendations based on real-world examples. To provide a detailed response to both questions: 1. It is not a hard-and-fast rule that you must be tech-savvy to start a tech company. While having a strong technical background can be beneficial, many successful tech entrepreneurs have started their companies without being experts in the field. Instead, they relied on their strengths in other areas such as management, sales, marketing, and their ability to learn and adapt. It is crucial for non-tech founders to surround themselves with a solid team that includes talented individuals with complementary tech skills. This will allow the founder to handle the business aspect while their team manages the technical side. Additionally, networking and forming partnerships with other tech-savvy professionals can aid in navigating the challenges of running a tech company. 2. Starting a tech company as a non-tech founder is undoubtedly a challenge, but it can certainly be possible with the right approach and mindset. The key for non-tech founders is to be aware of their limitations and continuously invest in their learning and development to close the knowledge gap. The founder should also be skilled in delegating tasks and establishing roles within their team to ensure a smooth operation. A major advantage for non-tech founders is that they often bring a unique perspective and fresh ideas to the table that technical experts may overlook. As a non-tech founder, focus on identifying problems that can be solved through technology and developing a compelling value proposition. By creating strong partnerships with technical professionals and experts, a non-tech founder can turn innovative ideas into competitive products or services. Overall, while being tech-savvy certainly has its benefits when starting a tech company, it is not mandatory. Engaging and collaborating with an experienced team and fostering an environment where learning and innovation thrive can lead to success, even for non-tech founders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"One would try not to hit with too much force.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard\\" is true, it is reasonable to state that it does entail the hypothesis \\"One would try not to hit with too much force.\\" In order to understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's first break down the meaning of each statement more thoroughly: Premise: \\"One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard.\\" This statement implies that a person would be cautious in applying force when hitting something, ensuring that they do not apply an excessive amount of force that could lead to unintended consequences or harm. In this context, \\"hitting too hard\\" suggests that the force applied is beyond what may be considered appropriate or necessary for the given situation. Hypothesis: \\"One would try not to hit with too much force.\\" This statement overlaps with the premise as it also refers to the intention of not applying excessive force when hitting something. The phrasing \\"try not to hit\\" indicates an effort or conscious attempt to regulate the amount of force being used. Given the concepts and ideas present in both the premise and hypothesis, we can ascertain that the two statements are related. Both statements revolve around the central idea of: being mindful of the force used when hitting something, with the purpose of avoiding any negative outcomes or unnecessary power exerted. In this case, the premise entails the hypothesis because the premise establishes an idea that an individual is careful not to hit too hard - meaning they are cautious of their force application. This directly relates to and supports the hypothesis, where the individual would \\"try not to hit\\" too forcefully. It can be inferred that if someone is careful or cautious in their actions, as indicated in the premise, they are indeed making an effort or actively attempting to regulate their level of force (as put forward by the hypothesis). Thus, accepting the premise as true, we also accept the hypothesis as a logical extension of the premise or the natural conclusion that can be drawn from it. Both statements ultimately emphasize the importance of controlling and regulating applied force when hitting something so as not to cross a threshold that could lead to harmful or detrimental effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choices: - carnivorous - synonomous - homologous - monogamous A: A:","completion":"The correct option from the provided answers is monogamous. Birds generally practice monogamous relationships, which means they have one mate at a time with whom they build a nest, raise their young, and share in the responsibilities of caring for their offspring. Both parents play a significant role in tending to their young, from incubating the eggs and providing food to protecting the nest and teaching their offspring essential life skills. Monogamous relationships provide numerous benefits for birds. By sharing the responsibilities of raising their young, both parents can maximize the, ensuring that their offspring have the best chance of survival. This joint effort reduces the time and energy needed for each parent to care for their offspring alone. In some bird species, this monogamous relationship may only last for a single breeding season, while others maintain a lifelong bond with their mate. There are also instances where some birds may engage in polygamy, but this is less common in the avian world. It is essential to recognize that this type of relationship is one of the key factors contributing to the success and well-being of bird populations globally. Monogamous relationships promote stability, cooperation, and the sharing of resources, helping to create a more resilient and adaptable species capable of thriving even in challenging and changing environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Special receivers were mounted in He 111s, with a radio mast on the bomber's fuselage. The system worked on a higher frequency (66–77 MHz, compared to Knickebein's 30–33 MHz).

Title: The pleasure of ethical paradox Review: Social satire has ever been an interesting and delightful way to discover and examine the basics of human behaviour and believing, both to show the weakness of logic and the strength of hypocrisy of many rules and customs. Butler, in his novel, developes this theme as a XIX century writer can do. The result is a pleasing reading, made a bit difficult by a slightly obsolete style and too much care of details, which sometimes gives some obstacles to thread. An example of how, about half a century later, a writer could have faced the same subject is given by new world by Huxley. The book is nonetherless quite readable, and an example of the high level tradition in which Butler can stand together with Swift. Is this product review negative? Options: i. Yes ii.

In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. and a hint : Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.

The exact amount of oil you will need will depend on the thickness of your chocolate and your desired consistency. Start by stirring in just a little splash, then add more if you need to. Use an unflavored oil so you don't alter the taste of your dessert. Coconut and canola oils work nicely for this, and coconut oil in particular has a pleasing texture on the palate. This will work best if you add the oil to the chocolate before you heat it. However, you can add it afterwards if you need to. Paramount Crystals are made of vegetable oils, and they’re popular with professional bakers because they’re effective and easy to use. If you’ve never used them before, start with a tiny bit and add more as needed. Try adding about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of Paramount Crystals for every 1 cup (240 mL) of chocolate. Because milk has a high fat content, it blends better into chocolate than water does. Start with about a capful of milk, then add more if needed. Just make sure you heat up the milk to about the same temperature as the chocolate before you add it, or else the chocolate will seize. Any milk will work, but whole milk will give you the richest result. You can also add warm cream to the chocolate for an even richer texture.

Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - Newburgh Priory is a large house near Coxwold , North Yorkshire , England . Standing on the site of an Augustinian priory , founded in 1145 , it is a stately home in a rural setting with views to the Kilburn White Horse in the distance .

It was an Augustinian Priory from 1145 providing priests for the surrounding churches in return for gifts of land and money from the rich landowners . It is reputed to be the burial place of Oliver Cromwell whose remains were said to have been taken to Newburgh Priory by his daughter Mary when she married the 2nd Viscount . The house was the country seat for the Bellasis family in the 16th and 17th century .

The population in 2011 was 5,284,000. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - The Kilburn White Horse, , is a hill figure cut into the hillside in the North York Moors National Park near Kilburn in North Yorkshire, England.

The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Vandal sabotages Verizon fiber-optic cables in Bronx A rash of vandalism across Verizon cable and phone lines that has swept through nine states during a three-week strike involving 36,000 workers hit the Bronx. About two hundred customers briefly lost phone, data and internet service Tuesday at around 2 a.m. when someone cut cables attached to a fiber optic hub on E. 196th St. and Hobart Ave. in Pelham Bay. An underground cable was also severed there, officials said. Verizon spokesman Richard Young attributed the vandalism to the strikers. EDITORIAL: STRIKE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS “It was a deliberate act of sabotage in which 200 customers were deprived of their ability to call friends or family or 911,” he said. “We have no idea who's doing this, but it impacts customers to a point where they could switch to our competitors, and that could affect our employment numbers down the line. In short, this is reckless, dangerous, short-sighted and dumb,” he said. In all, there have been 84 cases of similar vandalism in the region which stretches from New York to Virginia in the three weeks of the strike, Verizon said. That’s a huge spike, according to Young. He said the company gets reports of intentionally severed cables only about five times a year, and they rarely happen in heavily populated areas. Of the 84 incidents, 19 were in the city, 17 were in New Jersey, 12 were in Pennsylvania and two were in Massachusetts. The locations of the remaining 34 incidents were not immediately available. About 10,000 customers in all were temporarily affected by the outages. “There's no reason to do this other than try to hurt the company and our customers,” Young said. A spokeswoman for the Communication Workers of America denied any worker involvement. \\"There’s no reason why a Verizon worker would do that,” the spokesperson said. She blamed replacement workers for failures in the Verizon network. “Replacement workers just aren't following basic safety protocols,” she said. “And it's not their fault. They're minimally trained.” Some 36,000 Verizon workers walked off the job three weeks ago in an ongoing contract dispute over wages, pensions and health care benefits. Young insisted that the company wants to resolve the negotiations and get people back to work. “We put a proposal on the table last week,” he said. “The union came back to us but moved the ball in the wrong direction.” The striking workers plan more than 400 protests across the nation Thursday. About 2,000 workers will march Thursday from the Verizon office building on West St. near Battery Park to a Verizon Wireless story on Wall Street to demand a “fair” contract. Summary:","completion":"Vandalism of Verizon cable and phone lines has swept through nine states during a three-week strike involving 36,000 workers, causing approximately 10,000 customers to temporarily lose service. Verizon has reported 84 similar cases in the region stretching from New York to Virginia during the duration of the strike, with a company spokesman attributing the vandalism to the striking workers. The Communications Workers of America, however, denies worker involvement, blaming network failures instead on replacement workers not following basic safety protocols."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The proportion of pupils leaving Stretford Grammar School with five or more GCSEs at grades A*–C in 2006, was 98.3%, compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%. The proportion of students from minority ethnic backgrounds, and for whom English is an additional language, is much higher than the average. Stretford Grammar was awarded specialist Science College status in September 2005. The school was assessed as \\"good\\" in its April 2015 Ofsted report.Stretford High School Community Languages College, like Stretford Grammar, has a much higher proportion than the national average of pupils with a first language other than English, many of them being either asylum seekers or refugees. In 2004 Stretford High School was made subject to special measures, as it was considered not to be providing an adequate education for its pupils. Substantial improvement has taken place since then; the school was assessed as \\"satisfactory\\" in its November 2005 Ofsted report and was removed from special measures. Further improvements saw Stretford High School gain an \\"outstanding\\" assessment from Ofsted, following its February 2008 inspection.

The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - An attack aircraft, strike aircraft, or attack bomber, is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers, and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack. This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions, overlapping the tactical bomber mission. Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft. - A flight simulator is a device that artificially re-creates aircraft flight and the environment in which it flies, for pilot training, design, or other purposes. It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density, turbulence, wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc. Flight simulation is used for a variety of reasons, including flight training (mainly of pilots), the design and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities. - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including Novell DOS and Caldera OpenDOS. - Betrayal at Krondor is a DOS-based role-playing video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in the summer of 1993. \\"Betrayal at Krondor\\" takes place largely in Midkemia, the fantasy world developed by Raymond E. Feist in his \\"Riftwar\\" novels. The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Dynamix, Inc. was an American developer of video games from 1984 to 2001, best known for the flight simulator \\"Red Baron\\", the puzzle game \\"The Incredible Machine\\", the \\"Front Page Sports\\" series, the acclaimed \\"Betrayal at Krondor,\\" and their online multiplayer game \\"Tribes\\". - Kuwait ('), officially the State of Kuwait ('), is a country in Western Asia. Situated in the northern edge of Eastern Arabia at the tip of the Persian Gulf, it shares borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia. , Kuwait has a population of 4.2 million people; 1.3 million are Kuwaitis and 2.9 million are expatriates. Expatriates account for 70% of the population. - A- 10 Tank Killer is a flight simulation computer game for Amiga and DOS platforms developed and published by Dynamix . The game features an A- 10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft . The game was originally released for DOS in 1989 and for Amiga in 1990 . Following the success of Red Baron , version 1.5 was released in 1991 which included Gulf War missions and improved graphics and sounds . Several mission packs were sold separately . A sequel published by Sierra , Silent Thunder : A- 10 Tank Killer II , was released in 1996 . - A bomber is a combat aircraft designed to attack ground and sea targets by dropping air-to-ground weaponry, firing torpedoes or deploying air-launched cruise missiles. - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64. - In military tactics, close air support (CAS) is defined as air action by fixed or rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets, that are in close proximity to friendly forces, and which requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces. - The Gulf War (2 August 1990 28 February 1991), codenamed Operation Desert Shield (2 August 1990 17 January 1991) for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm (17 January 1991 28 February 1991) in its combat phase, was a war waged by coalition forces from 34 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait. - Saudi Arabia, officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is an Arab sovereign state in Western Asia constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula. With a land area of approximately , Saudi Arabia is geographically the fifth-largest state in Asia and second-largest state in the Arab world after Algeria. Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen to the south. It is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert or barren landforms. - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west.

Ronnie Cruz, the Chiefs' only fullback, is out for the year following an unspecified knee injury. Tight end Kris Wilson took over for Cruz. The Chiefs also signed fullback Greg Hanoian in the days before the game to add depth to the position. The game started with the Chiefs forcing turnovers on San Diego's first four possessions. Damon Huard later converted turnovers with two touchdown passes. Jared Allen forced a fumble from quarterback Philip Rivers, recovered by Tamba Hali. The Chiefs took advantage of the turnover by scoring a touchdown with Eddie Kennison, making the lead 14-0. The Chargers would kick a field goal and the Chiefs would respond with a 15-yard field goal extending the lead to 20-3.

Write a title for this article: Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers announced Sunday that he would retire from professional basketball after the end of this season, his 20th in the N.B.A., bringing to a close one of the most decorated careers in the history of the sport. Bryant, 37, made his announcement in the form of a short poem titled “Dear Basketball” on The Players’ Tribune, a website founded by the former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter that publishes first-person narratives from athletes. In short verses of unadorned language, Bryant recalled falling in love with the game of basketball as a child and growing up as a fan of the Lakers. You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream And I’ll always love you for it. But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer. This season is all I have left to give. My heart can take the pounding My mind can handle the grind But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye. Bryant had said on numerous occasions in recent months that this season was likely to be his last one — though he always qualified those statements, saying that he could change his mind. After playing in just 41 of 164 Lakers games in the previous two seasons because of a succession of injuries, he has looked like a diminished version of himself this season, producing poor numbers in most statistical categories. In a statement Sunday night, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver called Bryant “one of the greatest players in the history of our game.” Silver added, “I join Kobe’s millions of fans around the world in congratulating him on an outstanding N.B.A. career and thank him for so many thrilling memories.” Bryant was 17 years old when he was picked 13th over all in the 1996 draft by the Charlotte Hornets, who promptly traded him to the Lakers, the only organization for which he has played in his professional career. He has won five N.B.A. titles and two Olympic gold medals, has been named to 17 All-Star teams and was voted the league’s most valuable player in 2008. He ranks third on the N.B.A.’s career scoring list, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. For all Bryant’s success, he will leave a somewhat complicated legacy. He will be remembered as one of the best scorers in the history of the game, but he was also known as a difficult and demanding teammate. In 2003, he was accused of sexual assault in Colorado. He pleaded not guilty, and the charges were eventually dropped. Bryant is in the final year of a two-year contract with the Lakers and will earn 25 million in salary, making him the league’s highest-paid player this season. Even before this formal announcement, Bryant was receiving loud ovations in arenas around the country. In Brooklyn this month, Bryant joked that he preferred the typical hostility of opposing crowds. He said then that he did not want the season to turn into a prolonged, gushing farewell tour. But Bryant, after a celebrated career, may not have much of a choice.

Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Question: \\"What circumstances prompted tower control to contact American Airlines Flight 11? How was the pilot contacted?\\" Answer: \\"The aircraft failed to heed instructions to increase altitude, the pilot was contacted on emergency frequency\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. The tower control contacted American Airlines Flight 11 because the plane did not follow instructions to climb to 35,000 feet. The air traffic controller tried to reach the pilot on the emergency frequency."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution. The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad. British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954. When was new constitution drafted?","completion":"The new constitution was drafted and implemented in 1923, following the establishment of a parliamentary system in Egypt. This pivotal shift in governance was a major step forward in Egypt becoming a more democratic and modernized nation. The constitution laid the foundation for a new era of political development and served as the basis for future governmental reforms and changes. Saad Zaghlul, a prominent figure during this time, emerged as the leader of the Wafd Party and was instrumental in shaping Egypt's political landscape. He was popularly elected as Prime Minister in 1924, signifying the growing power and influence of the Wafd Party in Egyptian politics. This, in turn, led to a series of changes and amendments to the constitution, as well as causing tension with the British colonial influence that still persisted within the country. In 1936, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded, aiming to redefine the relationship between Egypt and Britain and diminish British control over Egyptian affairs. While this treaty marked a significant step towards Egypt's independence, lingering British influence and increasing political involvement by the Egyptian king contributed to further instability within the nation. This culminated in the 1952 Revolution, also known as the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which was a military coup d'état orchestrated by the Free Officers Movement, a group of military officers led by Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser. The revolution resulted in the overthrow of King Farouk, who was forced to abdicate in support of his son Fuad. The Free Officers Movement worked to dismantle the remaining British presence and influence in Egypt, ultimately achieving the complete withdrawal of British military forces from Egypt by 1954. In summary, the new constitution was drafted in 1923, initiating a significant transformation in Egypt's governance structure and political landscape. This period of tremendous change and modernization fundamentally shaped the course of Egyptian history, with lasting effects that can still be seen today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a detailed and long negative review: Title: Disappointing Experience at The Gourmet Bistro I had heard a lot about The Gourmet Bistro and what a fantastic dining experience it was supposed to be. So, I decided to visit and try their highly acclaimed dishes with a few friends on Saturday night. However, our experience at this restaurant turned out to be quite disappointing in various aspects, which I will detail below: 1. Service: Our server appeared to be quite unenthusiastic and inattentive. Whenever we needed something, it took multiple attempts to get his attention, which was quite frustrating. And when he did attend to us, the service was delivered begrudgingly, with no sense of warmth or friendliness. 2. Ambiance: The restaurant was poorly lit and had an off-putting odor, which made it anything but inviting. The tables and chairs were jammed close together, making it difficult to have private conversations, and the noise level was unbearably high. Furthermore, the washroom facilities were not adequately maintained, reducing the overall comfort of our dining experience. 3. Food: We ordered a variety of dishes, hoping to sample the best that The Gourmet Bistro had to offer. Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to the hype. The appetizers arrived cold, and the presentation was lackluster. The main courses were nothing to write home about – the steak I ordered was overcooked and lacked proper seasoning, while my friend's pasta was very bland. Moreover, the side dishes were poorly executed, with undercooked vegetables and soggy garlic bread. 4. Drinks: The drink menu seemed interesting, but the cocktails we ordered were weak and not well-balanced. My friends who opted for wine were not thrilled with the available selection, and the server wasn't knowledgeable enough to help them choose a suitable option. 5. Price: Considering the subpar quality of the food, service, and ambiance, I found the prices to be exorbitant. I understand that fine dining can be costly, but the value for money just didn't seem to be there in this case. Overall, our experience at The Gourmet Bistro was a letdown. The restaurant failed to deliver on its promise of exceptional service, inviting ambiance, and delicious cuisine. As a result, I cannot recommend The Gourmet Bistro to others and will not be returning for another visit.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

Since then, it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks: the University of Michigan, Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools, New York Law School, University of New Mexico School of Law, Thomas M.

The Ohio woman survived nearly two years before dying in 2017 at age 33; Slager, 42, pleaded no contest in 2016 to charges including arson and assault, and is now charged with her murder. Last week, a judge ruled that a \\"deathbed testimony\\" Malinowski gave will be used at the trial, People reports. The judge said the situation is unprecedented, the AP reports. Malinowski, who was burned over about 90% of her body in the attack, testified against Slager from her hospital room five months before she succumbed to her injuries, Fox News reports. Slager's attorneys tried to claim prosecutors improperly obtained the video testimony, but the judge noted that \\"the State wanted to preserve her testimony due to her fragile medical condition. She was critically ill, and was the only witness who could testify about the events that transpired on the day of her injury.\\" He also found that the defendant did have his right to confrontation recognized, as two-thirds of the deposition was cross-examination by Slager's lawyers, 10 News reports. \\"Judy ... went through this traumatic experience and she went to her grave thinking that the judicial system would unseal her side of the story,\\" her mother says. \\"So it was really important to me that that happens.\\" Slager's trial is set to begin in July; prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Expand this summary.","completion":"In a precedent-setting case in Ohio, a deceased victim will testify in her own murder trial. The defense attorney for Michael Slager claims that his former girlfriend, Judy Malinowski, will be the only victim to provide a \\"deathbed testimony\\" at her murder trial. Malinowski was doused with gasoline and set on fire by Slager in 2015, an attack from which she suffered extensive burns, covering 90% of her body. She survived for almost two years before passing away in 2017 at the age of 33. Slager, who is now 42 years old, pleaded no contest to multiple charges, including arson and assault, back in 2016, and he now faces murder charges. Last week, a judge ruled that Malinowski's testimony, which she gave from her hospital room five months before her death, will be admissible as evidence during the trial. The Associated Press reports that the judge called the situation \\"unprecedented.\\" In the video, Malinowski testified against Slager, detailing the assault she endured. Slager's attorneys attempted to argue that the prosecution had improperly obtained the video testimony. However, the judge pointed out that \\"the State wanted to preserve her testimony due to her fragile medical condition,\\" since Malinowski was critically ill and the only witness able to provide a firsthand account of the events leading to her injuries. The judge also determined that Slager's confrontation rights were acknowledged, as two-thirds of the deposition consisted of cross-examination conducted by the defendant's lawyers. The inclusion of the \\"deathbed testimony\\" in the trial is immensely important to Malinowski's family. Her mother expressed her relief, stating, \\"Judy ... went through this traumatic experience, and she went to her grave thinking that the judicial system would unseal her side of the story. So it was really important to me that that happens.\\" Michael Slager's trial is scheduled to commence in July, and the prosecution is seeking the death penalty as the outcome. The decision to allow Malinowski's testimony in court is a groundbreaking move and may have significant implications in future cases where victims are unable to testify due to their medical conditions or untimely deaths. This could potentially provide other victims a chance for posthumous justice and a voice in their own trials."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

It is unclear whether they had their own structure during the Latin Era or if they were under the Latin Church of Cyprus, as has been the case since the Ottoman Era. During the Ottoman Era, there was a very limited conversion of Armenian Orthodox to Catholicism, mainly due to the proselytising activities of the Franciscan mission in Nicosia and Larnaca, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries; however, these must have been temporary apostasies and their number never exceeded 50 at any given time. In 1794 the small Armenian Catholic community of Larnaca was granted some holy chalices from the auction of the belongings of the old Capuchin monastery of the town. It was during the British Era that the Armenian-Catholic community increased in number, due to the arrival of a large number of refugees from the Armenian Genocide. In 1931, there were about 200 Armenian-Catholics in Cyprus most of them became attached to the Latin places of worship, especially the Holy Cross cathedral in Nicosia and Saint Joseph's convent in Larnaca; between 1921-1923, the latter housed a small Armenian-Catholic school, run by Abbot Jean Kouyoumdjian - who served at the convent between 1921-1928. In 1960, there were less than 100 Armenian-Catholics. However, their number decreased in the following years, due to emigration to other countries and assimilation with the Armenian-Cypriot, the Latin-Cypriot and/or the Greek-Cypriot community. However, due to the influx of Lebanese-Armenians to Cyprus since the mid-1970s, there has been a small increase in the number of Armenian-Catholics on the island. Currently, local Armenian-Catholics are less than 20, in addition to about 30 foreign Armenians. What did the influx of Lebanese-Armeians cause?","completion":"The influx of Lebanese-Armenians caused a small increase in the number of Armenian-Catholics living in Cyprus. This means that more people from Lebanon, who are of Armenian descent and follow the Catholic religion, moved to Cyprus and added to the population of Armenian-Catholics on the island."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What does Beyoncé introduce by name as the song opens? is inside the article: \\"Déjà Vu\\" is a contemporary R&B song, performed in a moderate hip hop groove. It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone \\"to play something more singing\\",..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"As the song \\"Déjà Vu\\" opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat, and the Roland TR-808 drum machine by name.

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Ask a grown-up to help you with this step, because the oven can be very hot. Next, you need to make a baking sheet ready for the taquitos. You need to put a little bit of oil, butter, or cooking spray on the sheet so the taquitos won't stick when they cook. This is called \\"greasing\\" the baking sheet. After that, you need to warm up some oil in a pan on the stove. Then, you will cook the onion and garlic in the oil until they become soft and smell really good. Now, it's time for the beef! You need to mix the beef into the pan with the onion and garlic, and cook it until it changes color and becomes brown. Once the beef is brown, you can add yummy things like salsa, chili powder, salt, and pepper into the pan too. Stir it all together and let it cook for about 10 minutes, so all the flavors mix together. While the beef mixture is cooking, you can get the tortillas ready. Put them in the microwave for a little bit until they get soft and bendy. When the tortillas are soft, you can start putting together the taquitos! Take a spoon and put some beef mixture onto each tortilla, and then sprinkle some cheese on top. Be careful not to put too much, or the taquitos might be too full to roll up!

This will help them get crispy when they bake. Bake the taquitos in the preheated oven until they get crispy and golden. This usually takes a little while, so be patient! Finally, when the taquitos are ready, take them out of the oven and let them cool down a little bit. Now, you can serve them with yummy things like sour cream and more salsa for dipping!

However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru. The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions. Despite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit. \\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\\" a senior administration official said. The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration. Trump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border. Trump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall.

President Barack Obama has a few more months in the hot days of summer to get legislation through Congress, but representatives and senators will soon be focused on their campaigns with little thought for anything else. The midterm elections will be extraordinarily important for the composition of Congress. If Republicans can expand their numbers in the House and Senate, they might develop enough muscle to stifle Obama from accomplishing anything else. It could also be enough to put pressure on moderate Democrats to further undercut the legislative gains of the first term by enacting spending cuts and weakening the regulatory apparatus of programs like Dodd-Frank. On the other hand, if Democrats do well they can improve their standing in the House and place more pressure on Republicans to make compromises. Besides the composition of Congress, the midterms will provide some insight into the challenges each party will face and what promises they might make in the 2016 presidential election. The shape of the campaigns will start to clarify what the Republicans intend to stand for and whether they can put forth ideas that excite, rather than turn off, voters outside the reddest parts of the country. The rebellion taking place within the GOP has been growing more intense. Many senior leaders are warning that their party is on a destructive path that will only lead to more rounds of defeat. Many Republicans privately agreed when former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole said the GOP ought to be \\"closed for repairs\\" until next year, and in the meantime, \\"spend that time going over ideas and positive agenda.\\" Since 2010, Republicans invested almost everything in the issue of deficit reduction and saying no to everything that came out of the White House. The bet hasn't been paying off. At a certain point, voters seem to have lost interest in the message and, now that the long-term budget picture is doing much better while the economics of austerity has come under fire, the issue is gaining even less voter traction. The midterm elections will be the opportunity in the next two years for Republicans to show voters they have something more to say, and to offer two or three big ideas they can use in the race for the White House. Democrats face a similar challenge. They need to start hinting at what their party will be about in the post-Obama age. Many Democrats are wondering if the next election will be like 1988, when Vice President George H.W. Bush campaigned on Ronald Reagan's record and essentially promised to do more of the same, just in kinder and gentler fashion. Or will Democrats try to offer something more transformative -- a governing agenda for the challenges we face in 2016 rather than those we faced in 2008? Voters want to hear what Democrats have to say about federal investments in the nation's economic future, about how to handle climate change and how to build on Obama's promise to restore the balance between law and civil liberties and homeland security. If Democrats can start developing ideas for the next candidate to run on, they could not only bolster their numbers on the Hill but strengthen the platform for the next crop of candidates to win over voters. There are also questions about the mood of the electorate. Everyone will have a close eye on the immigrant vote. Although the turnout is much smaller in midterm elections, given the heat of the immigration debates, it will be significant to see if the energy levels are still high among immigrants for the Democrats and how much Republicans have been able to improve their standing with some high-profile party members like Marco Rubio coming out for reform. It will also be important to see whether any kind of anti-immigrant backlash sets in, similar to what Democrats saw against civil rights in 1966 following the race riots in Watts and other cities. The outcome of the debate over immigration legislation in the House will have a big effect. The aftermath of the recent controversies will also be significant. Right now the political cycle is in full scandal swing. The midterms will provide some sense of whether those stories have legs, either detrimentally for Democrats as Republicans suffered in 1974 after Watergate or whether a backlash sets in against the GOP, as New Gingrich and his allies suffered in 1998 amid the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Finally, the midterms will offer a platform for future presidential candidates to show their stuff. In 1966, former Vice President Richard Nixon seized the national spotlight, campaigning for Republicans across the nation, and making it clear, through his fundraising and speeches that he was a formidable candidate who could take on Lyndon Johnson, or any other Democrat. This year, candidates from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will seek to use this moment, with the national spotlight turned on the political playing field, for the same advantage. It will also be a chance for the parties to shake off some of the challenges that are holding them down, such as the right-wing drift of the GOP -- which could hurt the chances of the Republican candidates in 2016, regardless of how charismatic and talented they are. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The upcoming midterm campaigns and elections are crucial for both Democrats and Republicans in determining the composition of Congress and providing insights into the challenges faced by each party. The outcome of these elections could either give Republicans more leverage to hinder President Obama's accomplishments or enable Democrats to strengthen their stance in the House. For Republicans, the midterm elections provide an opportunity to display their ideas and future agenda to voters and demonstrate how they differentiate from the current administration. They need to shift their focus from deficit reduction and develop a more attractive message that will engage voters outside of their core constituencies. The rebellion within the GOP highlights the internal struggles and calls for change, emphasizing that the party should reevaluate their agenda and come up with fresh, innovative ideas. On the other hand, Democrats face the challenge of defining their party's agenda in the upcoming post-Obama era. They must determine whether they will continue with the current policies or offer a more transformative agenda that addresses new challenges faced in 2016 and beyond. Democrats also need to focus on issues like federal investments, climate change, and civil liberties in order to create a strong platform for future candidates. The mood of the electorate, particularly the immigrant vote, will play a significant role in these midterm elections. It is essential for both parties to consider their stance on immigration and avoid any potential backlash. The controversies surrounding the recent political scandals may also have an impact on the outcome of these elections, either negatively affecting the Democrats or creating a backlash against the GOP. Lastly, the midterm elections serve as a platform for future presidential candidates to showcase their potential. Potential candidates like Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie will seize this opportunity to establish themselves as strong contenders and demonstrate their ideas and policies to the electorate. The midterm elections are a critical point where both parties must address their challenges and reevaluate their agendas, ultimately shaping the political landscape for the upcoming years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read More Legendary New York Police Department Lieutenant Joe Petrosino was on duty investigating the mafia in Italy when he was killed. His funeral in New York was attended by 250,000 people, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. Close Italian police said the unsolved murder of legendary New York Police Department Lieutenant Joe Petrosino in 1909 is still a badge of honor among suspected mobsters in Sicily. Wiretaps recorded a conversation in which Domenico Palazzotto, a 28-year-old arrested today along with 90 others on charges ranging from extortion to vote buying, boasted that an ancestor of his killed Petrosino, police said in a statement e-mailed today. Paolo Palazzotto, tried last century and eventually acquitted due to a lack of evidence, committed the murder, prosecutors cite Domenico Palazzotto as saying. Petrosino was on duty investigating the mafia in Italy when he was killed. His funeral in New York was attended by 250,000 people, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. Domenico Palazzotto was born in Palermo, Sicily, where he still lives. Domenico Palazzotto, “as evidence of his own more than 100-year mafia pedigree, guaranteed by his descent from Paolo Palazzotto, confirmed the murder as the work of his own relative,” police said in the statement. Calls to the office of the Palermo prosecutor in an attempt to contact Palazzotto or identify his attorney went unanswered. To contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Frye in Rome at afrye@bloomberg.net; Giovanni Salzano in Rome at gsalzano@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Crawford at acrawford6@bloomberg.net Ben Sills, Marco Bertacche ||||| 1 of 2 The mystery surrounding the murder of a pioneering US anti-mafia detective might finally have been solved, more than 100 years after he was shot dead in Sicily. Italian police said that an alleged mobster has accidentally revealed the identity of the long-sought killer of New York detective Joseph Petrosino. In a taped conversation underscoring the long-running, tight family ties that characterise Mafia clans, Domenico Palazzotto claimed it was his great-uncle who gunned down the NYPD Lieutenant in Palermo in 1909. \\"My father's uncle, whose name was Paolo Palazzotto, was responsible for the first policeman killed in Palermo,\\" Palazzotto was heard saying as he bragged about his family's criminal history with fellow mobsters. \\"He killed Joe Petrosino, on behalf of Cascio Ferro\\". Palazzotto was among 95 suspected Mafiosi held by Italian police in a massive operation codenamed Apocalypse. The tape transcript was included in the arrest warrant. Petrosino was the first NYPD officer ever to be killed on foreign soil whilst on duty. He was shot four times by unknown attackers upon leaving a restaurant in central Palermo, where he was supposed to meet an informant. The police lieutenant was in the Sicilian capital on a special mission to investigate criminal ties between Cosa Nostra and its increasingly powerful American counterpart, the Black Hand. In particular, Petrosino was to collect evidence against Black Hand's alleged boss Vito Cascio Ferro, who had gone into hiding in his native Sicily after being acquitted from murder charges in the US a few years earlier. Celebrity detective Petrosino was a celebrity detective at the time of his dispatch to Sicily. A tireless worker famous for his tough investigating methods, the Italian native had been extremely successful in fighting gangs of fellow Italian migrants responsible for a wave of violent crimes that hit New York at the beginning of the 20th century. His knowledge of the Italian community and language had proved vital to police, since some 500,000 Italians lived in NYC at the time, more than in any other city in the world but Naples. In 1908 then Police Commission Theodore Roosevelt had appointed him as the head of an all-Italian elite detective squad tasked with investigating the migrant underworld. The squad's main target were indeed Vito Cascio Ferro and his Black Hand group, which, according to police, ran a series of trafficking rings and was responsible for many murders. Its members had also been accused of blackmailing the world famous Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, demanding money in exchange of his life. Paolo Palazzotto was among the members of the Black Hand who were arrested by the Italian squad and deported back to Italy. In February 1909 Petrosino decided to travel to Sicily to collect evidence against Cascio Ferro, despite being advised against it over fears for his safety. Although his mission was supposed to be secret, details had been published in the American press a few days prior to his departure. Two days after his murder the New York Times wrote that the American ambassador warned Petrosino about the risks of his trip, but the detective \\"smiled, as a man feeling sure of himself who did not mind the danger.\\" More than 200,000 people showed up to pay tribute to the policeman at his funerals in New York. Cascio Ferro was eventually accused of having ordered the murder but was acquitted due to lack of evidence. He was arrested on separate murder charges in May 1925, and died in a Palermo jail 20 years later. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Legendary New York Police Department Lieutenant Joe Petrosino was on duty investigating the mafia in Italy when he was killed in 1909.

Therefore, the answer to the question \\"How does a squid produce?\\" from the given options is \\"sexually.\\" To give a more detailed explanation, squid reproduction typically involves a male squid injecting sperm into a female squid through a specialized arm called a hectocotylus. The female then lays eggs which are fertilized by the sperm. The eggs are released into the ocean, usually attached to some surface or placed in a guarded location depending on the species. The young squid, also known as larvae or paralarvae, hatch from these eggs and enter the water, where they grow into adults. The process of sexual reproduction ensures genetic diversity among offspring, which is important for the survival and adaptability of species in their environment. This method of reproduction is common among many mollusks, including squids, and contributes to the successful persistence of these creatures in various marine ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The movie begins outside a liquor store in Columbia, located between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. in Howard County. Ben is talking to himself when Ben's older brother's friend Brian (played by Brian Seibert) overhears him, which embarrasses Ben. Ben's older brother Josh (played by Josh Davis) gets in the car and hands Ben a bag of liquor. They then drive to pick up Ben's three friends, Andy, Mattie and Nickie. After picking up Ben's three friends, the group heads off to Ocean City. During the trip to Ocean City the group has discussions about sex, which highlights the group's limited understanding of sex and their naivete.

Here's why: The reviewer seems to have mixed feelings about the food. While they mention that the brat is good and the buffalo sliders are spicy (which could be a positive for those who enjoy spicy food), they also state that the cheeseburger is just ok and that they did not enjoy the hummus, BLT, or club sandwich. These comments suggest that the reviewer found the food to be hit-or-miss, generally unimpressive, and not living up to their expectations. Their dissatisfaction with the beer list suggests they did not find the selection appealing. This component of the review works against the venue, especially if it's a place where patrons go expecting a robust and diverse beer offering. People actively seeking out a good beverage experience might see this as a significant negative. The reviewer's comments about feeling trapped in a booth can be seen as a criticism about the setting, atmosphere, or seating arrangement of the venue. They also express a disjointed experience of expectation versus reality, hinting that they want the venue to be a bar but feel as though it doesn't meet that desired vibe. Lastly, the reviewer's neutral to lukewarm feedback about the drinks being just \\"ok\\" contributes to the overall underwhelmed feeling coming from the review.

Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee Answer:","completion":"Title: A Question of Honor Plot Summary: Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee is a young, talented, and slightly overconfident Navy lawyer assigned to defend two Marines on trial for the murder of a fellow Marine at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The case appears straightforward, but as Kaffee digs deeper, he uncovers a complex web of deceit, corruption, and conflicting loyalties behind the incident. Act 1: The film opens with the brutal death of a young Marine, Private Santiago, on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Kaffee (played by Tom Cruise) is assigned to the defense team, along with his colleagues, Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway (played by Demi Moore), and Lieutenant Sam Weinberg (played by Kevin Pollak). They expect a straightforward case of defense, believing the two defendants, Lance Corporal Harold Dawson (played by Wolfgang Bodison) and Private Louden Downey (played by James Marshall), to be clearly guilty. Act 2: As the defense team begins their investigation, they learn that the two defendants were following a borderline illegal order called a \\"Code Red,\\" which was meant to discipline Santiago. The order came from their commanding officer, Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick (played by Kiefer Sutherland), under the direction of Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, the base commander (played by Jack Nicholson). Kaffee, Galloway, and Weinberg face enormous pressure from their superiors to plead guilty and avoid a potentially embarrassing trial. Kaffee initially considers a plea bargain but is challenged by Galloway, who believes there is more to the case than meets the eye. The defense team discovers inconsistencies in Santiago's treatment, ultimately revealing a systemic culture of abuse and secrecy on the base. Act 3: During the trial, Kaffee boldly confronts Colonel Jessep on the witness stand, demanding the truth about Santiago's death. Jessep arrogantly admits his involvement in the \\"Code Red,\\" justifying his actions as necessary for maintaining military discipline. Jessep is arrested, and the two defendants are found not guilty of murder but guilty of conduct unbecoming.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake. Question: suppose earth does not crack happens, how will it affect MORE/STRONGER earthquakes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If the Earth does not develop cracks deep beneath the surface, it would likely result in fewer and weaker earthquakes. The process you've described essentially outlines the mechanism through which earthquakes occur. This process is mainly associated with the movement of tectonic plates, which are large sections of Earth's crust that interact and move over time. The development of cracks is a critical component of this process. When cracks do not form, this suggests that there is less movement and interaction between the tectonic plates. As a result, the pressure that builds up between rocks on either side of the fissures is diminished. In this scenario, there will be less force and energy being applied to the plates, minimizing the possibility of an earthquake occurring. The lack of cracks also means that there is less potential for seismic waves to propagate throughout the Earth's crust. As the supposed perturbation influences the second effect by not allowing cracks to form or preventing them from expanding, the likelihood of powerful earthquakes occurring decreases. The absence of extensive fissures reduces the overall tension and stress built up within the Earth's crust, which is a significant factor contributing to the strength and frequency of earthquakes. Without this build-up of stress and tension, there is less potential energy released during earthquakes. Consequently, the seismic waves generated from such events will be weaker and less impactful. In summary, if the Earth does not develop deep cracks beneath its surface, there will likely be less potential energy stored within the Earth's crust, leading to fewer and weaker earthquakes overall. The supposed perturbation exerts a significant influence over the second effect, ultimately reducing the likelihood and intensity of seismic events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a pluricentric language, with two official forms, Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu, which are its standardised registers, and which may be called Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu when taken together. The colloquial registers are mostly indistinguishable, and even though the official standards are nearly identical in grammar, they differ in literary conventions and in academic and technical vocabulary, with Urdu adopting stronger Persian, Turkic and Arabic influences, and Hindi relying more heavily on Sanskrit. Before the Partition of the British Indian Empire, the terms \\"Hindustani, Urdu,\\" and \\"Hindi\\" were synonymous; all covered what would be called Urdu and Hindi today. The term \\"Hindustani\\" is still used for the colloquial language and \\"lingua franca\\" of North India and Pakistan, for example for the language of Bollywood films, as well as for several quite different varieties of Hindi spoken outside the Indian Subcontinent, such as Fiji Hindi of Fiji and the Caribbean Hindustani of Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, Barbados, and the rest of the Caribbean.

I just started my shift that afternoon, got endorsements from the previous shift, and prepared myself to meet my residents. One of my residents that day was post-op total knee replacement. I went to her room, introduced myself as her CNA, and asked her if she needed anything before I leave her room.

Because of this, I told her I’ll do my best to look for a commode that will fit her. I looked in our two storage areas and fortunately, I found one that was perfect for her! Voila! I disinfected it really well and returned to her room with her new commode. Her face immediately lighted up when she saw what I was carrying and she started tearing up! Startled by her reaction, I asked her what’s wrong and why was she crying. And then she told me she’s been asking the previous shifts for two days and no one’s bringing the right commode for her.

I helped her try the commode and it really was perfect for her and she didn’t have a hard time using it. She thanked me so much, and oh, it was mother’s day that day!

Write a title for this article: In the new HBO series “Divorce,” which premiered Sunday night, Sarah Jessica Parker ditches the stilettos, tutus and sequined numbers her character made famous on “Sex and the City” in favor of real-world cable-knit oatmeal sweaters, sensible brown boots and nubby wool tights. “This isn’t like anything she’s done in the past,” Arjun Bhasin, the show’s costume designer, tells The Post. He helped transform the famed fashionista into Frances, a stylish but approachable suburban mommy. “[Parker] had a strong idea of what she wanted [the character] to be,” Bhasin says, “but she was extremely open to what I wanted to do in terms of color palette and silhouette.” To get Frances’ authentic working-mom style, Bhasin and Parker turned to films of the 1970s, such as “Annie Hall” and “An Unmarried Woman,” which portrayed independent Manhattan women in swaggering separates, tweed blazers and dramatic camel-colored coats. That meant none of Bradshaw’s trademark Manolo Blahnik heels or Dolce & Gabbana frocks. “We decided early in the process that we wouldn’t do a lot of big-name-brand fashion shopping,” says Bhasin, who found the character’s ’70s print blouses, ’80s silk dresses and worn-leather accessories at flea markets and vintage shops throughout the country. “We wanted these to be clothes that a woman would have in her closet for years, so they had to look lived-in to give a sense of history for her character,” Bhasin says. He cites Frances’ classic dusty-pink overcoat as a particular example. “The idea of a coat for a woman in New York is so important,” he says. “It’s what you wear when you’re dealing with the elements . . . that coat is [Frances’] favorite — she wears it every day. We would build entire looks around [it].” Bhasin, however, also had to make sure the clothes told the character’s story. “Subdued and muted” colors — beige, brown, dark plum — show Frances’ melancholy, but he would often throw in busy prints to shake things up. “It conveys the inner turmoil and confusion going on in the character’s life,” Bhasin adds. “She has a lot going on in her mind.” Still, relying solely on vintage finds had its challenges. For a scene in which Frances goes to an art gallery, the petite Parker is wearing a 1980s white silk Ungaro dress with an abstract black print that Bhasin found at a flea market — in size 16. “I had to cut the whole thing down to make it fit her!” he says. “But it’s my favorite look from the whole show.” Title:","completion":"\\"Sarah Jessica Parker's New Mommy Style in 'Divorce'\\""},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In this situation, it's important to acknowledge that people have unique perspectives and reactions. Therefore, instead of choosing just one outcome, it's possible that we might observe a combination of the following scenarios among the Others: (I) Some of the Others may choose to stay faithful to Quinn. If these individuals have a strong bond with Quinn and know that relationships naturally evolve, they might continue supporting and being loyal to Quinn. They could understand that meeting a new person who brings happiness into their friend's life is a positive development and might not necessarily feel abandoned or replaced. These individuals may continue to offer help, friendship, and encouragement to Quinn in the hopes of maintaining their connection, despite the changing dynamics. (II) Others within the group may feel hurt. They might interpret Quinn's actions as a sign that their friendship or connection is no longer valued or appreciated. This could lead them to experience feelings of abandonment, jealousy, or resentment. In some cases, these individuals might distance themselves from Quinn or confront Quinn about their perceived neglect. It's also possible that they could discuss their feelings with other members of the group and seek their support and understanding. (III) There may be individuals among the Others who will be genuinely happy for Quinn. These people might feel thrilled and excited for their friend's newfound happiness, even if it means Quinn will spend less time and energy on their relationships with them. They might consider the positive change in Quinn's life as something worth celebrating and might even try to befriend the new man in Quinn's life. In this case, the emphasis would be on supporting and encouraging Quinn's happiness, rather than focusing on their own feelings of being ignored or replaced. The dynamics between Quinn and the Others are complex and multifaceted. Each person's reaction will be influenced by their own personality, experiences, and the depth of their connection with Quinn.

PUBLISHED:. 04:07 EST, 21 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:02 EST, 21 September 2013. Rising up: Carole, pictured after visiting her grandson George for the first time at St Mary's Hospital in London, has long been seen to have aristocratic aspirations. The agonies of how to design a new family coat of arms is one no doubt familiar to every aspirational family. So it can come as no surprise that faced with such a challenge the astute former air stewardess Carole Middleton - mother of the Duchess of Cambridge - sought the advice of those valued by other great British families - even those that don't actually exist. Downton Abbey has been revealed as the unlikely source of inspiration as the socially mobile Mrs Middleton set out to design her family crest in the run up to the 2011 royal wedding. The family even went to Highclere Castle, the set for ITV's award winning period drama, to meet etiquette expert historian Alastair Bruce who advises the show on social protocol. They were so delighted by the royal equerry's knowledge they asked him for help with the design of their own crest which was later used to adorn the programme at the Royal Wedding in April 2011. Mr Bruce, 53, is an expert on protocol and advises the actors and production team on the set of the show to make sure every aspect of every scene is historically accurate. Affectionately nicknamed the Oracle he has been known to stop filming because he spotted that the 'wrong' shoebrush was being used to shine some boots and is often found pacing the length of the Downton dining room adjusting cutlery and pleading with actors to keep their hands off the table. A source told The Sun: 'Alastair is also a Queen's Herald, so he has a lot of experience. 'But I'm sure people will be amused to know the Middletons looked to Downton Abbey for help in coming up with the coat of arms.' Although as a royal bride Kate would have been entitled to apply for a heraldic design in her own right, it was decided that her parents would commission one. How it might have been: Had she been without the help of her aristocratic advisors this is how the Middleton crest might have turned out. A high-class line-up: The cast of the popular show Downton Abbey. Painstaking process: After much discussion about the design Herald Painter Robert Parsons, sketches the Coat of Arms for the Middleton family. Coats of Arms came into being during medieval tournaments like jousting when knights would be recognised by the motifs on their shields or helmets and heralds quickly learnt the different ones in use, taking up responsibility for the control of their use.Over time their use began to decline in competition and battle but they became more widely used in society.The College of Arms, a branch of the Royal household, is the official body in the UK that deals with coats of arms and their team of experts - funded by the fees they charge and not taxpayers money - design and research heraldic or genealogical issues.The arms are given for free while the money people pay is for the research and design of the coat of arms.However, that doesn't mean that just anybody can pay the fee and get a coat of arms. The cumulative knowledge of the Earl Marshal gathered over hundreds of years has given them the skill of tactfully suggesting that people don't proceed with their application.The late Peter Gwynn-Jones, a former Garter King of Arms, once said: 'In practice, eligibility depends upon holding a civil or military commission, a sound university degree or professional qualification, or having achieved some measure of distinction in a field beneficial to society as a whole.' This gives his entire family – including their other children, Pippa, 30, and James, 26, the right to use the emblem. They met with Mr Bruce and his colleague Thomas Woodcock the College of Arms Garter Principle King of Arms and Senior Herald to invent their crest. Together they settled on a simple design, with three leafy acorns representing each of the couple’s three children – an idea suggested by Kate herself. Acorns were chosen for the analogy that they grow into great oaks. Oak is also a symbol of England and strength, and West Berkshire, where the children were brought up, has many oak trees. Most eye-catching is the gold chevron in the centre of the design representing Kate’s mother, Carole, at the heart of her family with the colour a subtle reference to her maiden name, Goldsmith. The two thin white chevronels on either side allude to mountains and the family’s love of skiing and outdoor pursuits. The background colours of red and blue were chosen as they are the principle colours from the flag of the United Kingdom and match Prince William’s recently revised coat of arms. The College of Arms also likes to include a pun wherever possible and has made the two colours meet squarely in the centre as a play on the words ‘middle tone’. But while Kate's brother James will be able to pass down the coat of arms to his children Pippa, as a woman, will not and can only use it during her lifetime. Yesterday a spokesman for Downton Abbey confirmed: 'Alastair worked with the Garter Principal King of Arms on developing the Middleton crest.' Royal wedding programme: Prince William's coat of arms was printed on the front while Kate's, designed in complimentary colours, decorated the back.

But Tiger Woods is also battling an injury at the U.S. Open in Pennsylvania. Woods revealed that he hurt his left arm while winning The Players Championship last month, which would explain why he grimaced noticeably on several occasions in the first round. The world's top-ranked golfer was back in action in the second round Friday and shot a level-par 70 to complete two rounds at three-over-par 143. Asked to provide more details about injury, Woods didn't elaborate. \\"Well, it is what it is,\\" Woods said. Woods is bidding to win his 15th major but first since 2008 at the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines. Back then he had to deal with seemingly a more serious injury -- a broken leg. He memorably beat Rocco Mediate in a playoff. Given the challenging conditions at Merion, Woods suggested his total might not be so bad heading into the final two rounds. Storms caused delays of more than four hours Thursday -- Woods had to complete his first round Friday -- and play was eventually suspended due to darkness. Windy conditions added to the degree of difficulty at Merion's shorter East Course. Woods, Rory McIlroy and Masters winner Adam Scott made for a dream pairing and while Scott struggled, Woods and McIlroy -- the second-ranked golfer -- fared better. Seen chatting amicably during the round, the duo compiled identical scores in the first two rounds. Beginning at the 11th hole, Woods birdied the 13th for a good start. Two bogeys, however, on the 14th and 18th, meant he had work to do on the first nine. Answer the following questions: 1. Who is the highest ranked golfer? 2. During what championship did he injure himself? 3. What body part did he injure? 4. Which one? 5. What major is he attempting to win? 6. How many would that total in his career? 7.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose \\"middle\\" compositional period was after 1901? from the following article ? The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W....

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been...

Joe yelled at the kids and took the toy away. The sisters were not amused. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The kids really like Joe.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot definitively conclude that the sentence \\"The kids really like Joe\\" is true. To better analyze this situation, let's break down the events that occurred. At the cookout, the kids were playing with an old toy on the lawn. Joe, who is 22 years older than his wife and presumably older than the other adults present, decides to yell at the kids and take the toy away. The reactions of the sisters to Joe's actions are that they were \\"not amused.\\" There is no direct information provided about the kids' feelings toward Joe. The actions described in the sentence, specifically Joe yelling at the kids and taking the toy away, might lead some to believe that the kids do not like Joe. It's possible that the children may view Joe negatively due to his seemingly harsh actions. However, it's also possible that the children understand Joe's perspective and continue to like him despite this particular incident. Additionally, the sisters' reactions to Joe's actions do not directly indicate the kids' feelings toward him. While it is apparent that the sisters were unhappy with his behavior, this information cannot be used to conclude the children's sentiments. Furthermore, it's essential to consider that people's feelings and opinions about others are complex and influenced by multiple factors. An isolated incident, such as the one described, might not entirely define the kids' opinion of Joe. They may have a positive relationship with him outside of this event, which could mean they still like him despite the unpleasant experience. In conclusion, given the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot be sure whether the sentence \\"The kids really like Joe\\" is accurate.

But in Iran, Valentine's Day has come to mark another occasion as well—the anniversary of the house arrest of Iran's leading opposition figures Mir Hossein Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi and Zahra Rahnavard. On February 14, 2011, Iranian authorities placed Mousavi, Karroubi and Rahnavard under house arrest for calling on Iranians to demonstrate in support of the popular Arab uprisings across the region. According to Reuters, earlier this month Karroubi was moved from a Ministry of Intelligence-controlled safe house to his own home. The transfer shined new light on the plight of Iran's \\"prisoners of rights\\"— those imprisoned for seeking to exercise commonly recognized political, social, religious, economic, and cultural rights, denied to them by the Iranian government. In addition to opposition politicians like Mousavi, Karroubi and Rahnavard, Iran's prisoners of rights include lawyers, journalists, professors, students, labor union workers, poets, musicians, artists, dissident clerics, bloggers, ethnic and religious minorities, LGBT persons and even humanitarian aid workers. Civil rights and human rights activists are also a primary target. Some prisoners of rights, like women's rights and student activist Bahareh Hedayat, have been arrested for holding gatherings to protest laws that discriminate against women. Others, like the \\"Yaran\\"—the seven leaders of the Bahá'í religious minority in Iran—are imprisoned for teaching a faith the Iranian government does not recognize. Still others, like lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, are imprisoned for their efforts to assist or seek justice for prisoners of rights. Ironically, before his arrest, Soltani had been preparing a case in defense of the seven Bahá'í leaders. Answer this series of questions: 1. Who are the leaders of the religious minority? 2. How many are there? 3. Where are they? 4. Are they in prison? 5. What were they helping people learn about? 6. Why did that get them jailed? 7. Who was their lawyer? 8. Is he also in prison? 9.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Did it really shut down or were you just lazy to post ?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the passage, it appears that the individual genuinely intended to post something before going to sleep, but encountered difficulty due to the computer being \\"hogged\\" and subsequently shutting down. The person's intention to post seems sincere, as they expressed frustration with the situation using the emoticon \\"> _ <\\". Additionally, the mention of staying up late to enjoy the Olympic badminton doubles event supports their claim that they had been engaged in other activities and were not simply being lazy in regard to posting. It is important to consider that the information provided does not give any direct indication of laziness. The issue at hand seemed to be more of an accessibility problem, with the computer being occupied or in use by someone or something else. The individual's inability to use the computer—combined with the shutdown event—created barriers to posting. In the given context, it appears that external factors, rather than laziness, prevented the individual from posting their intended content. In conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the passage, it can be reasonably inferred that the computer genuinely shut down, and the individual was not just being lazy to post.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who said Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Wagner, Mussorgsky, and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music? is inside the article: Colour lies at the heart of Messiaen's music. He believed that terms such as \\"tonal\\", \\"modal\\" and \\"serial\\" are misleading analytical conveniences. For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour. He said that Claudio Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Richard Wagner, Mussorgsky and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music.In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he said that he did not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie (\\"Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong\\"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple (\\"gold and brown\\") to the highly detailed (\\"blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant\\").When asked what Messiaen's main influence had been on composers, George Benjamin said, \\"I think the sheer ... colour has been so influential, ... rather than being a decorative element, [Messiaen showed that colour] could be a structural, a fundamental element, ... the fundamental material of the music itself.\\", can you guess it ?

Write a summary based on this article: With fresh evidence of a bloated bureaucracy in Detroit's Water and Sewerage Department, Mayor Dave Bing and the Detroit Water Board embraced a consultant's plan Wednesday that calls for eliminating four of every five employees over five years. The department, which has prompted suburban outrage by doubling rates in the past decade for its 4.3 million customers, plans to outsource billing, maintenance and other functions and hopes to save 900 million. Don't expect rebates or lower rates going forward, officials said Wednesday, but the plan aims to slow the rate hikes, which have averaged 8% annually in recent years. \\"These changes will not come without sacrifices,\\" Bing said Wednesday, adding that he felt for workers who are likely to lose their jobs. \\"We're working to limit the amount of increase in water rates for everyone.\\" Water board members used words such as \\"shock and awe\\" to describe their reaction to the consultant's report. Fred Barnes, who represents Macomb County on the board, said, \\"My jaw would still be on the floor\\" if board chairman James Fausone hadn't given him a heads up on the findings. Workers were immediately skeptical. \\"It's not possible. They don't have enough people as it is right now,\\" said John Riehl, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 207, which represents hundreds of water workers. \\"They are just dreaming to think they operate that plant with less.\\" Riehl said consultants and computers can't dig up a leaking pipe or fix a damaged machine -- those things only get done \\"by a worker with a wrench in his hand.\\" Riehl said his union will fight the job cuts. Bing brushed off accusations of union-busting, saying that's \\"the farthest thing from my mind.\\" \\"There are too many people who fight change, and the status quo got us where we are,\\" he said. The recommendation calls for the department to cut its work force 81% from 1,978 employees currently to about 374 over five years. An additional 361 outside employees would work for the department on contracts, bringing the total workforce to 735, about 63% below current levels. All job descriptions would be rewritten to be much broader than current ones to allow more flexibility. Brian Hurding, vice president of EMA, the firm that did the study, said the department had 257 job classifications, including \\"horseshoer.\\" \\"We didn't find any horses,\\" Hurding said. \\"That's the strangest job classification I've ever seen.\\" He noted later that the person in the job also was classified as a welder, which was his main job. Under the reorganization plan, the number of job classifications would fall to 31. Hurding said employees are hungry for changes. He said he interviewed a plumber who was sent to fix a broken pipe. \\"He had to wait half a day for an operator to come to shut off the valve so he could fix the pipe,\\" Hurding said. Under new job classifications, the plumber would be trained to close the valve himself so he could fix the pipe immediately, Hurding said. Although the water board was positive about the recommendations, several members said they wanted to verify the potential savings and the workability of the plan. \\"I think we have to have sensitivity, not only from a business standpoint, but also from a humanitarian standpoint,\\" said James Thrower, vice chairman of the board. Thrower stopped short of asking for a second firm to confirm the findings, but said he wants to verify the results in other places that have gone through similar reorganizations. Other board members agreed that they want to validate the results. Detroit City Council President Pro-Tem Gary Brown said the kinds of changes the department is pursuing could work in other areas of city government. \\"I think\\" the water department \\"is going to be a model for how every department in the city should be operating,\\" he said. Water department director Sue McCormick said she hoped to make most of the reductions through attrition, though she wouldn't rule out layoffs. She couldn't say when the reductions might begin. She said about 200 workers leave the department each year for other jobs and retirement. Workers don't appear to have many chances to fight the plan. The department's authority to make wholesale changes stems from a federal court order issued in a long-running pollution lawsuit. Last fall, U.S. District Judge Sean Cox told city officials they could ignore the city charter, local laws and even union contracts to meet requirements of the Clean Water Act. The order lifted limits on outsourcing and eased work rules to allow managers more flexibility. Cox made it clear that he viewed a more efficient department as necessary to meet pollution rules. Detroit Chief Operating Officer Chris Brown said Cox hasn't been briefed on the report and probably won't be. The judge sets the goal and the department must find a way to meet it, Brown said. The department awarded EMA a 175,000 contract to conduct the study, and consultants interviewed more than 200 employees as part of it. The report found that the department spends about 44% of its income paying down almost 6 billion in outstanding debt for things such as pipes and treatment plants. Because those costs are set for the long-term, any savings must come from operations. \\"We found the organization is siloed, with inflexible job descriptions, multiple reporting levels and a lack of training,\\" Hurding said. The study found the average cost per employee was 86,135, which includes wages and benefits. Hurding noted that savings can only be achieved by upgrading technology, outsourcing and retraining employees for new skills. McCormick said the department will expect employees to have higher, more diverse skills and it will likely pay them more. Cox's order exempts the water department from many of the pay grades and other work regulations that other city employees fall under. \\"We have to be competitive to attract the kind of people we need,\\" McCormick said. Oakland County Water Resources Commissioner John McCulloch said the report confirms what past studies have found: a bloated, inefficient department. \\"The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department was the quote, unquote, dumping ground for city employees for decades,\\" McCulloch said. \\"Given the cumbersome nature of city ordinances and contracts, it was very difficult to run this very efficiently.\\" McCulloch sat through the presentation and later said he was cautiously optimistic. Like several board members, he wants confirmation of the savings before proceeding. \\"You need a second opinion because of the magnitude of the dollars involved,\\" he said.

The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has a large debt, rising water prices and inefficient services — using almost twice the number of employees per gallon as other cities like Chicago. A recent independent report about the DWSD recommends that the city trim more than 80 percent of the department’s workforce. The consultant who wrote the report found 257 job descriptions, including a horseshoer. Capitol Confidential sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the department for the salary, benefits and job description of the horseshoer position. In response to the report, John Riehl, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 207, which represents many of the DWSD employees, told the Detroit Free Press that the department needs more workers. \\"They don't have enough people as it is right now,\\" Riehl said. \\"They are just dreaming to think they can operate that plant with less.\\" But critics say this is just another example of city departments operating as a jobs program for union employees. \\"They have said for years that they don't have enough people,\\" said Roi Chinn, a former city administrator and 2013 mayoral candidate for Detroit. \\"As the bureaucracy thickens and union power grows, there is always a built in reflex … to want more. \\"Whenever you think you’ve heard the bad about the city of Detroit, it gets worse.\\" Chinn said if he was mayor he would sell the water department. Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor for the Detroit Free Press, wrote last week about the \\"intolerable waste\\" in the water department. \\"For unions and the whole idea of collective bargaining, this is the kind of report that just makes any sort of future very, very hard to negotiate,\\" Henderson wrote. \\"It suggests that collective bargaining turns government into a provider of jobs instead of public services.\\" Daniel Edwards, a construction contracts manager with the DWSD, said the employee was transferred from the Detroit Police Department five years ago. The police department has horses, though the DWSD horseshoer no longer works with animals. \\"DWSD has a blacksmith shop in our Central Services Facility,\\" Edwards said. The shop \\"also ... repairs equipment and works with various metals and welding for the department when needed.\\" The horseshoer now works at the Central Services Facility. The city pays 29,245 in salary and about 27,000 in benefits for the horseshoer position. ~~~~~ See also: Detroit Water and Sewerage Department Shows Problem With Government Unions Detroit Tries To Salvage Water Department The Public Employee Union Problem ||||| Summary:","completion":"A big city called Detroit has a Water and Sewerage Department, which is in charge of giving water to the people who live there. The mayor and the Water Board want to make it better and save money by having fewer workers. They think they can save 900 million. The plan is to remove four of every five workers in the next five years. The people in charge of the department said that the plan will not make things worse for the people who use the water services. They hope it will stop the water prices from going up so fast. But some of the workers don't believe the plan is a good idea. They think there are already not enough workers. The people who want to make this change believe that their plan will make the water department work more like other modern departments in the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Jannat 2 Movie plot: Sonu's world is shaken to the core when he realises, after his marriage to Jhanvi, that Jhanvi's estranged father, Mangal Singh Tomar (Manish Choudhary), is actually the leader of the guns/arms business in Delhi. Soon enough, Sonu becomes a police informant for ACP Pratap, who has been looking for Mangal. Becoming a police informant, Sonu manages to convince Mangal that he is a corrupt and shrewd person who will be of use to his gang. Mangal embraces Sonu as his next in command. Sonu, caught between the devil and the deep sea, starts playing a double game. He neither gives information to the ACP, nor tells Mangal the truth about him being a police informer. Secretly he plans to run away with Jhanvi, so that he can live a peaceful life with her. However, things get risky once a mysterious informer in the police force tells Mangal about Sonu's truth. During a shootout, Mangal finds out the truth about Sonu, and takes his whole gang after him. Sonu, on the run, rings ACP Pratap for help. Pratap then brings his whole police force to the scene. There, Sonu is surrounded by Mangal's gang, which is then gunned down by the police chief commissioner. With only Sonu, Mangal and the chief left, it turns out that the chief is actually Mangal's informer, and they both chase Sonu to a deserted area. There, Sonu meets Pratap and tells him he is done and leaves to go to his wife. However he is shot by the chief. Pratap, seeing Sonu get killed, shoots the chief commissioner and Mangal multiple times, leading to their deaths. In the hospital, during Sonu's last words, he tells Pratap that his wife Jhanvi should not know about his death, and Pratap should tell her that he was a criminal who committed a robbery and ran away. After his death, Pratap goes to his house and informs Jhanvi that Sonu ran away from the city. Jhanvi, heartbroken, thinks straight and forgets Sonu, and moves away to carry on life as normal.

In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.

Specifically, an increase in pressure on rocks would directly affect the following steps in the process: 1. The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - With more pressure, rocks press against each other with even greater force. This can lead to more stress being placed on the cracks, causing the earth's crust to become more unstable. 2. The pressure and movement around the cracks cause the rocks to crumble in some places - With increased pressure, there is a greater likelihood of rocks crumbling or breaking, which can further destabilize the earth's crust and create more cracks and faults. 3. A lot of energy is released - The additional pressure exerted on the rocks can lead to more energy being stored and eventually released when an earthquake occurs.

I have a new situation: Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). But I can use this background: Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).

The range extends from about 10°N latitude to around 50°S latitude. Step 2: Determine which person's study area includes the Andes of South America Since the Andes mountain range lies within the latitudes of 10°N to 50°S, we can see that Alice's study area (30°N to 20°S) includes portions of the Andes. Pam's study area, on the other hand, focuses on higher latitudes (70 to 50°N) and does not include the Andes range. Step 3: Answer the question Considering the study areas, Pam studied less about the Andes of South America than Alice since her focus was on higher latitudes and her study area did not include the Andes range."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Kevin, on the other hand, recently moved to Toronto which just finished a several month long tree planting initiative that has drastically lowered the amount of air pollutants in the city. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is less at risk for having a heart attack? Answer:","completion":"Kevin is less at risk for having a heart attack compared to Michael, given the information provided in the paragraph. The reasons supporting this conclusion are based on the levels of air pollution in the two cities and the potential health effects of air pollution on the residents. Michael moved to Xin Jiang, where the chemical manufacturing industry contributes to a high amount of air pollutants. Exposure to high levels of air pollution has been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks. Air pollutants commonly found in heavily industrialized areas include particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ground-level ozone. These harmful substances can penetrate deep into the human respiratory system and blood vessels, causing inflammation, oxidative stress, and other harmful effects on the cardiovascular system. As a result, individuals living in areas with a high concentration of air pollutants are more likely to suffer from a range of health problems, including heart attacks. On the other hand, Kevin moved to Toronto, where the city has just implemented a successful tree-planting initiative that has significantly reduced the level of air pollutants. Trees play a vital role in air quality improvement by absorbing pollutants through their leaves and bark while also releasing oxygen. A cleaner environment and good air quality can protect and improve public health, especially in urban areas. Consequently, the reduction of air pollution in Toronto resulting from the tree-planting initiative indicates a lower risk of heart attack for its residents, including Kevin. In summary, given the differences in air pollution levels in Xin Jiang and Toronto, and the potential effects of pollution on cardiovascular health, it can be concluded that Kevin is less at risk for having a heart attack than Michael."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The basis of the beef that the NAACP had was the issue of de facto public school segregation in Michigan, particularly in the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties. Although schools were not legally segregated, the NAACP claimed that local and state governments had enacted policies that maintained racial segregation in public schools. They argued that there was a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, as segregated neighborhoods led to segregated schools. Due to this situation, the NAACP filed a lawsuit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, on August 18, 1970, in order to address the problem of de facto segregation and demand integration. This case, Milliken v. Bradley, had a significant national impact when it reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court's decision was narrow, emphasizing that schools were subject to local control and suburbs could not be compelled to resolve problems within the city's school district. This ruling emphasized the limitations of the federal government in enforcing desegregation beyond official policymaking and highlighted the complexities of addressing racial inequality in American public schools. The NAACP's beef, therefore, was rooted in the pursuit of equal education opportunities and an end to the racial segregation prevalent in public schools."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Modern Marvel's first superhero team, the titular stars of The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961), broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In 1975, George Carlin appeared on a popular TV show, Saturday Night Live, with his famous words about blue food. \\"Why is there no blue food? I can't find blue food--I can't find the flavor of blue! I mean yellow is lemon; orange is orange and red is cherry. Where is the blue food? \\" Well, Carlin pretty much has it right--there's not no blue food, but there's certainly not a lot of it. Fresh-picked blueberries are blue, though they become purple when they are turned into jam. The blue in blueberries--like the purple in grapes and the red in tomatoes--is found in nature. But it isn't a hot color for food. People don't seem to prefer blue food. Some diet programs even suggest that those determined to lose weight should make their food blue. Eating, in part, begins with our eyes. Charles Spence--an experimental psychologist from Oxford University--points out that color can change our taste experience. Commonly, we consider red-colored foods up to 20% sweeter than they actually are; and green foods as being more sour. Spence suggests: human expectations may be influenced by our long history of watching - green fruits can become sweet as they grow up and turn red. But what about blue? Except blueberries, much of the blue food we see these days _ blue artificially. Food producers argue that artificial color doesn't do much harm to health. A lot of research shows that some physical problems of kids are related to food dyes--while other studies show no effects at all. Blue birthday cake or even blue-dyed chicken can be served on the dinner table. So what? A:","completion":"A: Which of the following statements is true according to the article about blue food? 1. George Carlin's words about blue food were inspired by a wide variety of naturally blue foods. 2.

Most blue foods available today are naturally blue, with no artificial coloring added. 4. Artificial blue food coloring has consistently been linked to physical problems in children across all studies. Answer: 2.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"In the scenario where conditions are calm and rocks stay in one place, this perturbation can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. To better understand why, let's first review the steps of the rock formation process: 1. Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock. 2. The wind or water deposits tiny rocks. 3. The rocks become known as sediment. 4. The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top. 5. Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve. 6. Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock. When conditions are calm, the transport and deposition of sediment (steps 2 and 3) are affected. Without wind or water currents to move the sediments, they may remain in their original location rather than being transported to new areas and deposited. Since the layers of sediment are crucial for the formation of sedimentary rocks, the absence of such layers would interrupt the normal rock formation process. However, the calm conditions do not directly alter any particular step. Instead, they create an environment where some steps might be less likely to occur, causing indirect effects on the overall process. It's important to remember that calm conditions may not completely halt rock formation; they may merely slow down or change the manner in which sediments accumulate and rocks form. For example, during calm conditions, sediment deposition may still occur due to gravity or other factors, such as chemical precipitation. These processes might take longer or lead to different rock characteristics than those formed through wind or water deposition. In summary, the perturbation of calm conditions and rocks staying in one place indirectly impacts a step of the process by affecting sediment transport and deposition. This may lead to a slower rock formation process or influence the characteristics of the sedimentary rock produced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Initially, the couple had thought that the peaceful and idyllic environment of the countryside would provide the perfect setting for their relationship to flourish. They had romanticized the idea of living close to nature, having more time to spend with each other, and the serenity that they believed would strengthen their bond. However, what they didn't anticipate was that the tranquil and unhurried lifestyle they thought would bring them closer together only served to create monotony and boredom in their lives. The lack of excitement, adventure, and stimulation in the country took a toll on their relationship. They began to drift apart, realizing that they had different interests, hobbies, and passions that weren't being fulfilled. The seclusion in the countryside didn't offer them enough opportunities to meet new people, explore various experiences, or engage in activities that were instrumental in enhancing their personal growth. When they moved to the city, their relationship found a fresh lease of life. The bustling, energetic, and vibrant atmosphere of the city introduced a tidal wave of excitement and novelty into their lives. The abundant options of cultural events, artistic performances, diverse group interests, and professional opportunities proved to be a catalyst for their personal growth and development. As they explored their individual interests, they each began to grow and evolve, which, in turn, positively affected their relationship. The city offered a rich canvas for them to develop shared experiences and create new memories together. They found motivation in pursuing their respective careers and passions, which were now within their reach. The cosmopolitan culture and diverse community in the city also exposed them to individuals from different walks of life. This allowed them to develop a broader perspective towards life and enabled them to appreciate and understand each other better. Therefore, it became evident that the city was the perfect breeding ground for their relationship to prosper and bloom. The country had been an unmotivating atmosphere for them, unable to cater to their personalities and aspirations, which caused their relationship to wither.

Movie title: The Entity Context: The movie begins as single mother Carla Moran (Barbara Hershey) is violently raped in her home by an invisible assailant. A subsequent episode of poltergeist activity causes her to flee with her children to the home of her friend Cindy (Margaret Blye). They return to Carla's home and the following day, Carla is nearly killed when her car mysteriously goes out of control in traffic. Urged by Cindy to see a psychiatrist, Carla meets with Dr. Sneiderman (Ron Silver) and tentatively agrees to undergo therapy. A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes she has inflicted them on herself (despite the marks showing up in places impossible for her to reach). We learn that Carla suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual and physical abuse, teenage pregnancy and the violent death of her first husband. Dr. Sneiderman believes her apparent paranormal experiences are delusions resulting from her past psychological trauma. Carla is attacked again, this time in front of her children. Her son tries to intervene but he is hit by electrical discharges and his wrist is broken. Dr. Sneiderman urges her to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital for observation, but she refuses. After Cindy witnesses an attack, the two discuss possible supernatural causes. While visiting a local bookstore, Carla happens to meet two parapsychologists, whom she convinces to visit her home. Initially skeptical, they witness several paranormal events and agree to study the home.

Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman. A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup. The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, \\"I hope that helps a bit.\\" I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Film is inextricably linked with the locations of its production and reception. The translation of \\"Film ist untrennbar mit den Orten seiner Herstellung und Rezeption verbunden\\" from German to English is: \\"Film is inextricably linked with the locations of its production and reception.\\" The sentence conveys the idea that the process of producing and showcasing films is fundamentally interconnected with the places where they are created and exhibited. This relationship between film and its locations underlines the importance of understanding local culture, trends, and socio-political contexts for a comprehensive appreciation of the art form. Additionally, the role of specific landscapes and environments in shaping a movie's atmosphere and themes cannot be overstated. In terms of production, the locations chosen for shooting films often have a significant impact on a film's visuals, narrative, and cultural resonance. Filmmakers often select settings that possess a unique atmosphere, provide a sense of authenticity, or evoke specific emotions in the audience. Shooting on location offers opportunities for films to convey a genuine understanding of a particular region's culture and incorporate regional themes or aesthetic elements into the storytelling. The history and cultural associations of specific locations also contribute to this process and can be harnessed to imbue a film with a distinctive visual identity, emotional depth, or social resonance. Aside from establishing a strong aesthetic identity, the relationship between film and its production locations extends to the local industries and professionals who contribute their skills, talent, and labor to filmmaking. A healthy film industry within a region is an important source of skilled technicians, actors, and other creative professionals, ensuring that production proceeds efficiently and meets artistic goals. Furthermore, local production facilities such as sound stages, post-production studios, and equipment rental companies are crucial components for a successful film industry. In terms of reception, movie theaters and other exhibition venues play an essential role in connecting the film to its audience. These locations serve as spaces of social interaction, where viewers gather to see films and participate in a shared cultural experience. The ways in which films are presented and consumed can be significantly influenced by regional movie-going traditions, preferred genres or styles, and local audience preferences. Understanding these cultural differences and how they affect film reception can provide valuable insights for filmmakers, distributers, and critics, as well as contribute to the ongoing cultural exchange across nations and communities. Overall, this interconnected relationship between film and its production and reception locations is a fundamental aspect of the filmic experience. Considering the role of these locations in shaping both the creation and consumption of films can lead to a richer understanding of the medium and provide valuable insights for industry professionals and audiences alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. - A landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Typical landforms include hills, mountains, plateaus, canyons, valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Volcanic gases include a variety of substances given off by active (or, at times, by dormant) volcanoes. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. - A planetary body or planetary object is any secondary body in the Solar System that is geologically differentiated or in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus has a planet-like geology: a planet, dwarf planet, or the larger moons and asteroids. - In hillslope geomorphology, a rill is a shallow channel (no more than a few tens of centimetres deep) cut into soil by the erosive action of flowing water. Similar but smaller incised channels are known as microrills; larger incised channels are known as gullies. - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it. - A bay is a body of water connected to an ocean or lake, formed by an indentation of the shoreline. A large bay may be called a \\"gulf\\", a \\"sea\\", a \\"sound\\", or a \\"bight\\". A \\"cove\\" is a smaller circular or oval coastal inlet with a narrow entrance; some coves may be referred to as bays. A \\"fjord\\" is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - A LAND (Local Area Network Denial) attack is a DoS (Denial of Service) attack that consists of sending a special poison spoofed packet to a computer, causing it to lock up. The security flaw was first discovered in 1997 by someone using the alias \\"m3lt\\", and has resurfaced many years later in operating systems such as Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP SP2. - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area , usually in the form of a peak . A mountain is generally steeper than a hill . Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism . These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth . Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers , weather conditions , and glaciers . A few mountains are isolated summits , but most occur in huge mountain ranges . High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level . These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains : different elevations have different plants and animals . Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate , mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation , such as mountain climbing . The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia , whose summit is 8,850 m ( 29,035 ft ) above mean sea level . The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m ( 69,459 ft ) . - Terrain or relief (also topographical relief) is the vertical and horizontal dimension of the land surface. When relief is described underwater, the term bathymetry is used. The Latin Word \\"Terra (The root word of terrain),\\" is \\"Earth.\\" - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Volcanic rock (often shortened to volcanics in scientific contexts) is a rock formed from magma erupted from a volcano. In other words, it differs from other igneous rock by being of volcanic origin. Like all rock types, the concept of volcanic rock is artificial, and in nature volcanic rocks grade into hypabyssal and metamorphic rocks and constitute an important element of some sediments and sedimentary rocks. For these reasons, in geology, volcanics and shallow hypabyssal rocks are not always treated as distinct. In the context of Precambrian shield geology, the term \\"volcanic\\" is often applied to what are strictly metavolcanic rocks. - In geology and earth science, a plateau (or ; plural plateaus or plateaux), also called a high plain or tableland, is an area of highland, usually consisting of relatively flat terrain that is raised significantly above the surrounding area, often with one or more sides with steep slopes. - A mid-ocean ridge is an underwater mountain system formed by plate tectonics. It consists of various mountains linked in chains, typically having a valley known as a rift running along its spine. This type of oceanic mountain ridge is characteristic of what is known as an oceanic spreading center, which is responsible for seafloor spreading. The production of new seafloor results from mantle upwelling in response to plate spreading; this isentropic upwelling solid mantle material eventually exceeds the solidus and melts. The buoyant melt rises as magma at a linear weakness in the oceanic crust, and emerges as lava, creating new crust upon cooling. A mid-ocean ridge demarcates the boundary between two tectonic plates, and consequently is termed a divergent plate boundary. - Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Topography is the study of the shape and features of the surface of the Earth and other observable astronomical objects including planets, moons, and asteroids. The topography of an area could refer to the surface shapes and features themselves, or a description (especially their depiction in maps). What object entity has the relation of 'part of' with the subject 'mountain'?

Options: - live long - leave home - feel pain - eating - sense fear in human Explain why a human would choose \\"feel pain\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"A human might choose \\"feel pain\\" as the answer to the question of what an animal does when it becomes old due to several reasons: Step 1: Analyzing the question First, the human would understand the context of the question, which is focusing on the behavior or condition of animals as they age. Step 2: Evaluating the alternatives The human would then examine the given options: - Live long: This option doesn't accurately describe the condition or behavior of an old animal, since living long is relative and might not be applicable to all animals. - Leave home: This choice does not accurately represent a general behavior for all animals when they grow old. - Feel pain: This option refers to the potential physical discomfort or health issues that animals might experience as they age. - Eating: This alternative doesn't describe a specific behavior that only applies to old animals, as animals need to eat throughout their entire lives. - Sense fear in human: This choice is not related to animals becoming old and is not a characteristic of animals aging. Step 3: Choosing the most appropriate option The human would most likely select \\"feel pain\\" as the best answer to the question because it addresses a common aspect of the aging process for both animals and humans. As animals grow older, their bodies may undergo wear and tear, leading to health issues and physical discomfort. This choice captures the reality that aging often brings about some level of pain or discomfort, making it a reasonable assumption that this is what animals experience when they become old."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: HANGZHOU, China -- Millions of Chinese basketball fans who were upset about the retirement of Yao Ming, are excited to see another even more shining star, Jeremy Lin, rising from the N.B.A and becoming a household name all across China. \\"We are amazed by Lin Shuhao's magic performance and should cheer him on,\\" one Internet user wrote. \\"His sport shirts have sold out, even including the counterfeit ones,\\" said Zheng Xiaojun, a 24-year-old clerk. Lin's amazing success over the last month has caught the imagination of the Chinese. He has been particularly popular here in northern Zhejiang province, from which his grandmother went to Taiwan in the late 1940s. Cai Qi, a well-known micro blogger, posted a message on micro blog over the weekend stating that Lin's hometown is Jiaxing, a city near Hangzhou where Lin's grandmother grew up. Cai Qi's nephew Yu Guohua, a 56-year-old factory worker, is Lin's closest still living in northern Zhejiang. He said in a telephone interview that Lin had come to play basketball with the Jiaxing High School team last May and had been surrounded by admirers. Yu said he did not have a chance to meet Lin in the crowd, but managed to speak with his family. \\"His father was very supportive of Lin's playing basketball, but his grandmother was not, for fear he would be injured,\\" Yu said. Lin may owe his height, 6 feet 3 inches, to his grandmother's family, Yu said. Chen Weiji, the father of Lin's grandmother, was well over 6 feet and all of Chen's children were tall as well, he said. The N.B.A. believes that 300 million people in China play basketball. The retirement last year of Yao Ming took its main Asian draw away from the N.B.A. But Lin's appearance has helped the league remain a hot topic of Chinese online chatter.

A survey shows that the tigers are in more danger of dying out than China's most famous animal,the giant panda.Forty years ago,about 4,000 South China tigers lived in the wild.Today there are only about 30.An additional 64 live in 19 zoos in China,,which are all descendants of six wild animals seized in 1956. The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage. When the cubs first arrived in South Africa,they didn't even want to leave their cages.It took weeks to get them to eat chicken,used as they were to being fed beef at the Zoo in China where they were born.It took months of practice to hunt a live animal and then make the link between the kill and food.Now just a few months on,and living in a 150-acre camp,they have become remarkably skilled hunters. All four animals will finally return to Zoos in China while the pioneering pairs' cubs will grow up completely wild.The aim is for _ to go to reserves developed in China by 2008,when the Olympic Games will be held in Beijing.

Which language is this?","completion":"This sentence is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to other Slavic languages, particularly Slovak and somewhat to Polish. The sentence \\"Dělali jste si s ním, co jste chtěli\\" can be translated to \\"You did with him whatever you wanted\\" in English. The Czech language uses the Roman alphabet and features diacritical marks, such as the háček and the acute, which help indicate pronunciation and distinguish between different sounds. The language's grammar is highly inflected, employing a case system which marks nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and numerals. This system helps convey meaning based on the word's form rather than its position in a sentence, making word order in Czech more flexible than in English. Czech is mutually intelligible with the Slovak language, and speakers of both languages can often understand each other without many difficulties. Czech and Slovak diverged primarily because of political history and geographic separation. While both languages share many similarities, they exhibit differences in phonetics, morphology, and vocabulary. Czech has a long literary tradition, dating back to the early Middle Ages. Some significant Czech literary figures include Jan Hus, an early church reformer and precursor to Martin Luther; Božena Němcová, a 19th-century writer celebrated for her collections of fairy tales and novels; and Jaroslav Seifert, a 20th-century poet and the first Czech to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Czech literature has played a vital role in the development of the Czech national identity and the preservation of the Czech language throughout various historical periods, including times of foreign rule and political unrest. Today, the Czech language continues to thrive and holds great importance in education, media, and official communication in the Czech Republic. Learning Czech as a foreign language can be challenging due to its complex grammar and pronunciation rules, but it can provide access to the rich cultural heritage of the Czech nation and allow for more meaningful ties with the Czech people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We can simplify it by adding the constants (-6 and +14) together. -6 + 14 = 8 Step 2: Rewrite the equation with the simplified constants. Now that we've simplified the constants, we can rewrite the equation: 0 = 2*t + 8 Step 3: Isolate the variable. To isolate t, we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 8 = 2*t + 8 - 8 -8 = 2*t Step 4: Solve for the variable. Now that we have isolated t, we can solve for its value. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 2: -8 / 2 = 2*t / 2 -4 = t Step 5: Write the final answer.

Article: How to deal successfully with a child who shows outstanding musical ability?It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift.Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their children's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour.And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are specially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school--especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity.Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction.They aim to provide an environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber groups,voice training,conducting and theory.They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms,sometimes with a teacher.The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths,basic sciences and languages.All five British specialist schools are independent,classes are small by normal school standards,with a high teacher/pupil ratio .Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders,leaving home to live,eat and sleep fulltime at school. What are the disadvantages?An obvious problem is the cost;the fees are high(PS12,000PS17,000 a year for boarders).However,each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance,to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees.Secondly,not all parents want to send their children to boarding school,especially at a very early age.Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting...

It has a higher joule rating capacity and plenty of indicator lights so you really know what's going on with the power and watt usage. Best of all it is much cheaper than Monster. I use Tripp Lite surge protectors exclusively - I live in an area of frequent power surges and lightning strikes. I have had Tripp Lite protectors burn out, but never had any equipment fried. For example, the last surge that came through the neighborhood was caused by a telephone pole being hit by a truck. When that happened, a 19,200 volt line hit the 2400 volt line that supplies our homes. I lost six surge protectors but no equipment.

First, let's understand what that math problem is asking. It wants us to find out what number we can put in place of the ‘v’ to make it true. Now let’s solve it step-by-step. The equation is 0 = -47*v + 30*v + 136. Let's first add the terms that involve 'v'. That’s -47*v and 30*v. When we add -47 and 30, we get -17. So, our expression becomes 0 = -17*v + 136. Now we want to get 'v' on one side of the equation by itself. So let's subtract 136 from both sides. This gives us -136 = -17*v. Finally, we want to get 'v' all by itself, and we do that by dividing everything by -17. So, divide -136 by -17, and we get 8. So, the answer is v = 8. That means that if we put 8 in place of ‘v’ in our original problem, both sides of the '=' sign will have the same value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill OAM (19 February 1937 - 3 March 2008) was a cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia. A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25. Standing six feet tall, O'Neill was compared to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because of his ability to score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings. O'Neill was highly regarded for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said \\"once set he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see--he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers--you can't really describe how good they were.\\" His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was \\"one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket\\". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say \\"the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant\\" Wisden opined that \\"A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power.\\" Later in his career, O'Neill became a nervous and superstitious batsman, particular at the start of an innings. He wrote \\"batting is a lonely business\\" in his 1964 autobiography Ins and Outs, opining that he sometimes found first-class cricket to be \\"depressing and lonely\\". He was regarded as an excellent fieldsman at cover, with a powerful and accurate throw, described by Wisden as a \\"dream throw\\" honed from a junior career as a baseballer. He was named as utility player in the 1957 All Australian baseball team, and his ability was such that he was approached by Major League Baseball scouts. Before the retirement of Neil Harvey, he and O'Neill fielded in tandem in the covers and the pair were regarded as the finest fielding combination of the time. Did any of his teammates comment about his play style?","completion":"Yes, Norman O'Neill's teammates did comment about his play style.

He stumbles onto the set of a World War I movie and isn't sure if he has accidentally caused the death of one of the film's stunt men. The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene. The final day of filming involves a complicated stunt where Cameron has to drive a vintage Duesenberg off a bridge. Nina has two other scenes to shoot as well, but Cameron is convinced Eli will rig the stunt so he will die. He persuades Nina to run away with him, but they are unable to leave the set, which is kept sealed from the neighboring town by the police on Eli's orders. Nina hides in the trunk of the Duesenberg, promising to slip away with Cameron during the stunt. Before the scene is shot, Eli points to the Duesenberg and explains it is the only copy of the vintage car that the production has. He therefore orders that no one interrupt the filming of...

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Maybe you are an average student. You probably think you will never be a top student. This is not necessarily so. Anyone can become a good student if he or she wants to. Here's how you can be a good student. Plan your time carefully. When planning your week, you should make a list of things that you have to do. After making this list, you should make a plan of your time. First, your time for eating, sleeping, dressing... Then decide a good, regular time for studying. Don't forget to set enough time for entertainment. A weekly plan may not work out all your problems, but it will push you to realize what is happening to your time. Find a good place to study. Look around the house for a good study place. Keep this space which may be a desk or simply a corner of your room, free of everything but study materials. No game, radio, or TV! When you sit down to study, concentrate on your subjects. Make good use of your time. Listen to everything the teacher says. Listening carefully in class means less work later. Taking notes will help you remember what the teacher says. Study regularly. When you get home from school, go over your notes. Review the important points that your teacher has mentioned in class. If you know what your teacher is going to discuss the next day, read that material. This will help you understand the next class. If you do these things regularly, the material will become more meaningful, and you will remember it longer. Develop a good attitude to tests. The purpose of a test is to show what you have learned about a subject. It helps you remember your new knowledge. The world won't end if you don't pass a test, so don't be worried. There are other ideas that might help you with your study. You will probably find many others after you have tried these. Question: Which following statement is NOT TRUE according to the passage? - We should set enough time for entertainment when we plan our week. - We don't have to find a good place to study. - It's helpful to take notes in class because it makes us remember what the teacher says. - We never give up our study although we don't pass a test.

The customer also took note of the cashier’s accuracy in predicting the waiting time. Overall, these aspects of the review indicate a level of satisfaction with the service provided at the establishment. However, on the negative side, the customer expresses dissatisfaction with the price of the items ordered. The phrase \\"I though it was pricy\\" suggests that they found the cost to be higher than what they expected or considered reasonable. The customer lists the items and their collective cost (28.65) to emphasize their point about the perceived high pricing. This negative sentiment is also reflected in the rating, as the customer explicitly states that the price factor is \\"the only reason why not five stars.\\" In summary, the sentiment of this review is a combination of positive and negative emotions.

Summarize the following: If you need to remove oxidization from wires, a rosin-based solder is your best bet. As most electronics use more fragile, thinner wires, anything too corrosive may risk damaging them and shorting your circuit. Find a rosin-based solder at your local hardware store when working with electronics. If you're working with something bigger than electrical wiring, such as copper piping, you'll need something more corrosive. Acid flux or tinning flux will remove larger areas of oxidization and give you a much stronger soldering job. Tinning flux has small amounts of a powdered metal alloy mixed into the paste. The powder will melt with the flux and help fill the inside of the pipe you are soldering, making it more waterproof and longer-lasting. Leaded solder will melt at a lower temperature than other types, which makes it better for delicate electrical wiring. Ask at your local hardware or electronics store for leaded or electrical solder and you should have a small variety of types to choose from. Here are a few key differences in types of solder that may come up: Lead-free electrical solder will also work for small wiring projects. It is more environmentally-friendly as it doesn't contain lead, but also will not hold quite as strong. Some leaded solders will come with a rosin core. This means that they are slightly hollow and will have a thin line of rosin flux running through the middle. It will only be a small amount, so it shouldn't replace other flux, but it will increase the flux coating of your wires. Leaded solders that are solid all the way through and don't have a rosin core are also a solid choice. These may oxidize slightly more, but as long as you are using soldering flux they should still hold strongly for a long time. If you are using leaded solder, make sure to wash your hands once you have finished working with it as the lead is toxic. Silver has a much higher melting point than lead, so it works much better for larger soldering projects. Ask for pipe or silvered solder at your local hardware store when working with pipes. You should never use lead-based solder when working with piping that will carry water, as the lead is toxic and will make the water unsafe to drink. While lead-free solder may work when soldering pipes, it won't be as strong or as durable as silvered solder. Plug in or turn on your soldering iron to start heating it up. Once it is hot, use a damp sponge to clean away any solder left on the tip of the iron, making sure to never touch the hot end of the iron while it is on. Always keep your soldering iron in a stand while it is on. The tip will get very hot, so it shouldn't be allowed to rest on any surfaces as this may start a fire. Don't leave your soldering iron unattended while you are using it. Apply a small amount of solder to the end of your soldering iron once it has heated up and been cleaned. Once the tip is covered and has a shiny appearance, you can wipe away any excess on the same damp sponge. This is called \\"tinning\\" your iron and will stop it from oxidizing as you work with it. As pipes are much bigger and more solid than intricate wiring, a soldering iron may take a long time to heat a pipe up to the right temperature. Use a propane torch or something similar when soldering with pipes. For the best results, adjust the torch until you have a blue flame around 2 inches (5.1 cm) long, and hold the tip of the flame to the pipes. Make sure you always light your blowtorch away from yourself and use proper safety precautions when working with it. Wear protective, tinted glasses, fire-proof leather gloves and flame-retardant clothing for extra safety. Getting the perfect temperature with a blowtorch may take more practice than when working with a soldering iron. If the flux you are working with begins smoldering and turns black, it's a sign you are using too much heat. If the solder doesn't melt when touched to pipes, you might not be using enough. Keep practicing until you get a sense of the right way to work.","completion":"To clean wires, use a rosin-based solder that you can find in a store. For bigger things like pipes, use stronger stuff like acid flux or tinning flux. There are different kinds of solder, like lead-free and leaded, and some with rosin inside. For pipes, use silver solder instead of lead solder, because lead is not safe for water. When using a soldering iron, be careful because it's hot. Clean and tin the iron to protect it. For pipes, use a propane torch instead of a soldering iron, and be very safe while using it. Practice to find the right temperature when soldering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were each recommended to make changes to their diets. Michael took this advice to heart, and reduced the levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol he consumed. Robert, on the other hand, continued to consume high levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will be at lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future? Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. A:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, it can be concluded that Michael will be at a lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future.

Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Iejima ( Iejima ) , previously romanized in English as Ie Shima , is an island in Okinawa Prefecture , Japan , lying a few kilometers off the Motobu Peninsula on Okinawa Island . The island measures 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) in circumference and covers 23 square kilometres ( 8.9 sq mi ) . As of December 2012 the island had a population of 4,610 . Most islanders live in Ie Village , which has a ferry connection with the town Motobu on Okinawa Island . Iejima is generally flat . The most notable geographic feature is a peak called Mount Gusuku ( or locally \`\` Tacchu '' ) at a height of 172 meters . The mountain resembles a volcano but is actually an erosion artifact . U.S. journalist Ernie Pyle died there during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. There is a monument dedicated to his memory on the southern part of the island . Every year on the weekend closest to his April 18 death there is a memorial service . Alternately called \`\` Peanut Island , '' for its general shape and peanut crop , or \`\` Flower Island , '' for its abundant flora and more sizeable crop , Iejima draws tourists by ferry , especially during late April when the Ie Lily Festival begins .

In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - The Korean War (in South Korean , \\"Korean War\\"; in North Korean , \\"Fatherland Liberation War\\"; 25 June 1950 27 July 1953) began when North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations, with the United States as the principal force, came to the aid of South Korea. China came to the aid of North Korea, and the Soviet Union gave some assistance. - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\").

It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, and known in Vietnam as Resistance War Against America or simply the American War, was a war that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union, China and other communist allies and the South Vietnamese army was supported by the United States, South Korea, Australia, Thailand and other anti-communist allies and the war is therefore considered a Cold War-era proxy war. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - It rises above east of the island and is clearly visible from the main island of Okinawa and in the East China Sea. The outline of Mount Gusuku can be clearly seen from the Motobu Peninsula on Okinawa Island and Sesoko Island. The mountain has historically served as a nautical landmark and appears in Japanese nautical charts from the medieval period. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - The Iraq War was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that toppled the government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first 34 years of conflict. The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011 but left private security contractors in its place to continue the war. It again became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue. - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef). - Okinawa has been a critical strategic location for the United States Armed Forces since the end of World War II. The island hosts around 26,000 US military personnel, about half of the total complement of the United States Forces Japan, spread among 32 bases and 48 training sites. US bases in Okinawa played critical roles in the Korean War, Vietnam War, War in Afghanistan and Iraq War. The presence of the US military in Okinawa has caused political controversy both on the island and elsewhere in Japan. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The Sea of Okhotsk is a marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean, lying between the Kamchatka Peninsula on the east, the Kuril Islands on the southeast, the island of Hokkaido to the south, the island of Sakhalin along the west, and a long stretch of eastern Siberian coast (the Shantar Sea) along the west and north. The northeast corner is the Shelikhov Gulf. The sea is named after Okhotsk, the first Russian settlement in the Far East. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.

News article: CASABLANCA—A decade ago, the U.S. released three hardened Moroccan militants from Guantanamo and turned them over to the Moroccan government on the assumption they wouldn't return to the battlefield. They wound up leading one of the most violent Islamist groups fighting in Syria's civil war. Their story serves as a cautionary tale days... ||||| Story highlights About 17% of Gitmo detainees return to terrorist activities, report says As of last month, the Guantanamo Bay detention facility had 154 detainees Not everyone at Guantanamo Bay has been found guilty of terrorism Guantanamo Bay detainees have long been considered America's most dangerous enemies.

MUST WATCH Video released of Bergdahl's transfer 04:12 The five detainees have been at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba for years, and out of commission for a long time. They probably don't have extensive networks to tap into, according to two senior U.S. officials. Additionally, there will be fewer U.S. forces to target in Afghanistan since under a new agreement, most troops will be out of the nation next year. Qatar has also reassured the United States that it will aggressively monitor the detainees, who will be under a travel ban for one year. How many freed detainees have returned to terrorism? At its peak, Guantanamo Bay had 770 men believed by the U.S. government to be involved in terrorist activity or military attacks. That number has dwindled significantly. As of last month, the facility had 154 detainees. A September 2013 report from the director of national intelligence reflected on what happened to the roughly 600 people who left Gitmo between its opening in 2002 and July 2013. Of those, 100 -- or 16.6% of the released prisoners -- were \\"confirmed\\" to have returned \\"to terrorist activities.\\" Seventeen of those died, while 27 ended up in custody, according to the DNI report. An additional 70 are \\"suspected of reengaging,\\" it said. \\"Based on trends identified during the past 10 years, we assess that if additional detainees are transferred without conditions ... some will reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities,\\" the report said. Does the U.S. keep an eye on freed detainees? While the former prisoners are no longer under its control, Washington says it keeps track of them, which is the basis of the DNI report. During President George W. Bush's administration, some were handed over to authorities in other countries. Dozens more were released under Obama. Are American interests more at risk when they get out? There are a lot of variables, making this a debatable question. Except for those accused or convicted of the most heinous crimes such as murder, most people are not detained indefinitely. And studies show the recidivism rate for those in the U.S. legal system typically top 50% or even 60%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . Armed with that knowledge, the idea of a Gitmo detainee returning to his previous ways may not be surprising. It also depends on where they go from there. The DNI report notes the dangers of transferring prisoners to nations with conflicts, instability and active recruitment by terror groups. In other words, a detainee who returns to a place beset by violence -- where terrorist groups and attacks are common -- is more likely to return to the fold. Does this mean the U.S. got a raw deal in Bergdahl's release? Depends on whom you ask. Sen. John McCain , a former prisoner of war, is not popping the Champagne just yet. He knows a thing or two about life in enemy hands after spending more than five years in captivity in North Vietnam. Since then, he has emerged as one of the nation's loudest, boldest voices on military matters. And he feels strongly that the United States did not think this through. \\"Don't trade one person for five (of) the hardest of the hard-core, murdering war criminals who will clearly re-enter the fight and send them to Qatar, of all places,\\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night. But White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice defended the Obama administration's decision. The \\"acute urgency\\" of Bergdahl's health condition justified the President not notifying Congress beforehand that he was being swapped for the five detainees, she said. Why are terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay? The U.S. naval base there was transformed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks . Existing migrant detention facilities were revamped to house detainees of the so-called war on terror. JUST WATCHED What happened when Bergdahl disappeared? Replay More Videos ...

U.S. authorities said they didn't have the same rights as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. Nor did they have the same rights as those detained within the United States. The Bush administration argued that since the detainees were not on U.S. soil, they were not covered by the U.S. Constitution. It used that rationale to justify the lack of legal protections for those detained. That made the base sometimes referred to as Gitmo a sort of no man's land. How much does it cost to keep it running? Shortly after his inauguration in 2009, Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facility within one year. It has not happened. Has everyone at Gitmo been found guilty of terrorism? No. Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst, and Bailey Cahall, a research associate at the New America Foundation, wrote in an op-ed last year that said dozens of detainees cleared for release years ago \\"remain in seemingly perpetual custody.\\" \\"They have found to be guilty of nothing, yet they are being held indefinitely,\\" Bergen and Cahall wrote. \\"Indefinite detention without charge is a policy that we usually associate with dictatorships, not democracies.\\" Bergen also heads the New America Foundation's International Security Program. Others, though, view the situation differently. They say terrorists don't play by any recognized rules of warfare or justice; their mission is to kill, with U.S. forces and citizens as their targets. McCain says that the five men released as part of the Bergdahl deal could be among those attacking U.S. citizens both at home and overseas. The five \\"were judged time after time as unworthy ... that needed to be kept in detention because they posed a risk and a threat to the United States of America,\\" the Arizona Republican said. Who were the detainees swapped for Bergdahl? Two senior Obama administration officials identified them as Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They were mostly mid- to high-level officials in the Taliban regime who were detained early in the war in Afghanistan because of their positions within the Taliban, not because of ties to al Qaeda. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Three Moroccan militants, previously released from Guantanamo by the U.S. and turned over to the Moroccan government, ended up leading one of the most violent Islamist groups in Syria's civil war. A report indicates that about 17% of Guantanamo detainees return to terrorist activities. As of last month, Guantanamo Bay housed 154 detainees. A concern is raised over how dangerous the latest swap of detainees might be. However, the Obama administration refutes these concerns as the detention facility has not been a recruiting ground for extended terror networks. Nevertheless, an intelligence report from September 2013 shared that of about 600 detainees who left Guantanamo between 2002 and 2013, 100 were confirmed to have returned to terrorist activities. The report also forecasted a likelihood of some transferred detainees reengaging in terrorist activities. The U.S. maintains surveillance on freed detainees and many of them were handed over to foreign authorities or released under President Obama's administration. The continuous release of detainees poses a debatable risk to American interests. The recidivism rate amidst former Guantanamo detainees could be influenced by the conflict level in the areas they returned to. Critics such as Sen. John McCain express concerns about these practices. McCain believes that swapping detainees like the notorious case of Bergdahl's release lacks thorough consideration for potential adversarial consequences. Guantanamo Bay was repurposed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to house terror suspects due to their undefined detention category under either the Geneva Conventions or the U.S. Constitution. The closure of the facility has been attempted but has not been achieved. Despite the notorious reputation of the Bay, not all detainees found there have been guilty of terrorism, with some being kept in seemingly perpetual time of custody. The terrorists there, according to critics, pose a threat to U.S citizens and U.S forces abroad."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East and forms the core of Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities. Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400, when it became a county of itself, a status it retained until becoming part of Tyne and Wear in 1974.

Process: - The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - The aluminum is collected - Taken to a treatment plant - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - The aluminum is re-melted - Turned into molten aluminum - The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out - The rolled out product is made into new aluminum products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose money is needed for other things happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis states that if money is needed for other things, it may have an effect on the process of recycling aluminum cans. Let's analyze this step-by-step: 1. The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - If money is needed for other things, this may lead to cutbacks in public services, potentially including recycling programs. This could make it more difficult for consumers to access recycling bins, potentially reducing the amount of aluminum recycled. 2. The aluminum is collected - If budgets are tight, waste management companies may face financial constraints. This could lead to less frequent collection services, reducing the volume of aluminum recycled. 3. Taken to a treatment plant - If money is needed elsewhere, treatment plants may face budget cuts or scaled-back operations, potentially limiting the amount of aluminum they can process. 4. The aluminum is sorted and cleaned, ready for reprocessing - Reduced funding may lead to less efficient sorting and cleaning processes, potentially reducing the quality of the recycled aluminum or the overall volume. 5. The aluminum is re-melted and turned into molten aluminum - On this step, the perturbation might not have a significant direct impact as the process is largely dependent on the proper functioning of the melting furnaces. 6. The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - If resources are scarce, there may be fewer facilities available to process ingots or lower-capacity machinery, potentially slowing down the ingot production process. 7. The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out - Budget cuts might lead to delays in transportation or higher costs, which could affect how ingots are rolled out and converted into usable materials. 8. The rolled-out product is made into new aluminum products - Limited funding could translate to reduced research or investments in new production technologies, potentially decreasing the efficiency of manufacturing new aluminum products. In conclusion, the perturbation that money is needed for other things could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of recycling aluminum cans. It may lead to reductions in waste management and recycling services, potential inefficiencies in the treatment and reprocessing facilities, and potential impacts on the production of new aluminum products. All these factors could potentially contribute to a decrease in the overall volume of aluminum cans being recycled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. Sent 2: If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Sent 3: Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. Sent 4: (1996 Almanac, p. Sent 5: 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Sent 6: Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. Sent 7: The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. Sent 8: If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. Sent 9: The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). Sent 10: LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Sent 11: Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Sent 12: Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs.

Plot title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Such disparities in experience can have a rippling effect on their ability to navigate the challenges that they may face while working at the company. Given that Randy is a worker at the company, he is likely to have a deep understanding of the company's culture, its mission, and its values. He may have developed a strong relationship with other team members and gained invaluable insights into how the company operates. With this experience, Randy is better equipped to handle the complexities of the job and can adapt more easily to any new changes or unexpected situations. On the other hand, Christopher, who is not a worker at the company, lacks these crucial experiences. He might find it challenging to navigate the company's hierarchy and may not understand the subtle nuances that come with the company culture. This can make it harder for him to know which steps to take when faced with a problem or even when making decisions that impact the company. Furthermore, he might find it difficult to connect and communicate with other employees, which can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings. Additionally, Randy's tenure at the company also means that he has accumulated industry-specific knowledge and has developed his expertise in the company's field of operation. This accumulated knowledge and experience allow him to make informed decisions, providing a vital advantage over someone like Christopher, who has less knowledge about the company's operations and industry. It is essential for companies to recognize the value of experienced employees like Randy. Seasoned employees play a crucial role in training and mentoring less experienced staff like Christopher, who can eventually grow to become valuable team members. Strengthening the bond between experienced and inexperienced workers can help develop a deeper sense of job ownership, creating a more cohesive and successful team. In conclusion, it is clear that Christopher has a lot less experience in the situation than Randy because Randy is a worker at the company. Christopher may struggle to adapt to the company culture, understand the industry deeply, and communicate effectively with coworkers, which can negatively impact his performance. However, with the support and guidance from experienced workers like Randy, Christopher can learn and grow in his role, eventually gaining the necessary experience and expertise to contribute positively to the company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Great Raid Movie plot: In 1944, American forces were closing in on the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Japanese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March in a notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan and subjected them to brutal treatment and summary execution, as the Japanese view surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with malaria. The film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though factually, it was committed by the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army). Meanwhile, at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the 6th Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan. Throughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the Filipino resistance and the Japanese. In particular, the film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse Margaret Utinsky, who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to Fort Santiago prison. She was eventually released, but spent six weeks recovering from gangrene as a result of injuries sustained from beatings.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How secure and private is it to store all my photos in Google Drive? Is there any proof of Google looking at private documents stored in Google Drive? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Storing your photos in Google Drive offers a certain level of security and privacy, but it is essential to understand the mechanisms in place and potential risks for a more comprehensive view. Let's break down the factors impacting the security and privacy of your photos on Google Drive: 1. Encryption & Data Protection: Google Drive uses encryption to secure your photos both at rest and in transit. It uses SSL/TLS encryption when your photos are uploaded and downloaded between your device and Google Drive. Additionally, once your photos are stored on the Google servers, they are encrypted using AES128 or AES256 algorithms. Encryption helps protect your data from unauthorized access. However, given the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, no encryption method can guarantee complete protection. 2. Access Control: You have control over how you share your Google Drive files, including your photos. By default, your files are private, and only you can access them. Sharing settings allow you to grant specific individuals access to your files by specifying their email addresses. Additionally, you can generate shareable links giving anyone with the link access to the file. It is crucial always to review these settings and understand them before sharing your photos. 3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Google offers two-factor authentication, an added layer of security requiring users to provide two proofs of identity before accessing their accounts. This can significantly decrease the risk of unauthorized access to your photos if your password is compromised. It is highly recommended to enable this feature on your account. 4. Google Privacy Policy & Access to Data: Google's privacy policy states that they may \\"collect, store, and process information in the United States and any other country where Google or its service providers operate.\\" While Google maintains that their employees do not have direct access to your content, the policy also states that Google can access your information under specific situations such as complying with legal requirements, detecting and preventing fraud, addressing security issues, or technical issues. This means that in rare circumstances, Google might access your private photos as per their privacy policy. 5. Potential Threats: Storing photos on Google Drive, like any other online storage, exposes them to potential threats such as hackers and data breaches. Although Google has robust security measures in place, the risk of unauthorized access cannot be completely eliminated. Regarding the question of whether there is any proof of Google looking at private documents stored in Google Drive, Google itself claims that they do not access or scan your Google Drive files for advertising purposes. However, as mentioned earlier, they might access your files in specific situations, as dictated by their privacy policy. In conclusion, while the questions are related, they are not the same. The first question concerns the security and privacy of storing photos on Google Drive, which depends on various factors, including encryption, access control, and Google's privacy policy. The second question focuses on whether there is any evidence that Google actively looks at private documents stored on its platform. While Google Drive offers notable security measures, it is always crucial to stay vigilant and take additional precautions to protect your photos, such as enabling two-factor authentication, regularly reviewing sharing settings, and having a strong, unique password. Finally, diversifying your data storage and having local backups can also help prevent data loss and enhance your privacy."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Context_10 : Suraiya Jamaal Sheikh (15 June 1929 – 31 January 2004), popularly known as Suraiya, was an Indian Muslim Hindi/Hindustani film actress and playback singer in Bollywood from the 1940s to the early 1960s, who remained unmarried throughout her life, after her love affair with actor Dev Anand was aborted by her maternal grandmother. She was the most popular singing star of the Indian sub-continent of her generation. Until 1943, as a child singer, Suraiya did playback singing for one actress, namely Mehtab, in three films, and also in some of her own films for her roles as a child artiste. After this, she only sang for her own films as an actress, and acted as a heroine from 1946 until the end of her career in 1963. From 1948 to 1951, she became the singing superstar of Bollywood, earning more for her performances than all the performing actors of the times, male or female, including Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Nargis and Madhubala. She received 1.5–2 lakhs rupees for her role per film, when top male actors were getting 50 thousand to 1 lakh rs. For a song, she commanded rs. 1000, while Lata Mangeshkar was getting rs. 100–200 per song. She was the only child of her parents. She had a natural talent for singing, acting and dancing from childhood. She received basic training in music when her mother used to take her to a Hindustani music teacher or 'masterji' for training. She first sang for a children's program for All India Radio in 1937. Later on Naushad gave her on the job 'training', while recording. She went on to become one of the most successful singing film stars of Bollywood. She had received training in dancing from Mumtaz Ali, dancer-actor and father of the famous comedian Mehmood. She was also known for her North Indian Muslim feudal style acting or 'adakari' in many of her films (\\"Mirza Ghalib (film)\\", \\"Phool\\", \\"Afsar\\", \\"Shayar\\", \\"Jeet (1949 film)\\", \\"Anmol Ghadi\\" and \\"Dastan\\"). This style 'endowed modernity with an aura of tradition' and brought nostalgic feudal tinge to the scenes. Her performance 'expertly integrated gestures, music and speech'. Suraiya in her heyday was known as 'Malika-e-Husn' (queen of beauty), 'Malika-e-Tarannum' (queen of melody) and 'Malika-e-Adakaari' (queen of acting), all rolled into one. In a career spanning from 1936 till 1963, Suraiya sang 338 songs in films (which were mostly her own films) and 2 in addition were non-film songs, namely, 'tum rahe kahan ko piya' and 'hum tum karenge pyar'. She acted in 67 movies, which do not include the incomplete films such as \\"Jaanwar\\" (with Dilip Kumar), \\"Paagal Khaana\\" with Bharat Bhushan and an Indo-British film on Wajid Ali Shah (1953) being directed by British director, Herbert Marshall, with Ashok Kumar in the role of Wajid Ali Shah. fact_1 : Before going solo, she was half of a popular Indian duo with her younger brother Shaan with whom she released albums such as \\"Q-Funk\\", \\"Roop Inka Mastana\\" and \\"Naujawan\\". fact_2 : Shantanu Mukherjee (born 30 September 1972), known as Shaan, is an Indian playback singer active in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu, Telugu and Kannada films and a television host.

Please answer the following question: Dan found three rattle snakes: one only had one rattle, the second snake had 4 rattles and the third snake had seven rattles on its tail. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which snake had more segments, the first or the second snake Dan found? Hint: At birth, a rattlesnake hatchling has only a small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.[13] The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time.[14] A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.[15] Answer:","completion":"The second snake Dan found had more segments. According to the information provided, a rattlesnake is born with a primordial rattle or a \\"button,\\" and it gains its first rattle segment when it sheds its skin for the first time. A new segment is added with every subsequent shedding. Although the rattle's length is not a reliable age indicator due to segments breaking off, we can still compare the rattles of the two snakes in question. The first snake had only one rattle, meaning it had shed its skin once after birth and gained its first segment. The second snake, on the other hand, had four rattles, which indicates it had shed its skin four times and gained four segments. Therefore, the second snake had more segments than the first snake Dan found."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Scott Freeman, meanwhile, is a New Mexican businessman flying his private Beechcraft Baron to an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility.

From 1879, Watch Tower supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically. Thirty congregations were founded, and during 1879 and 1880, Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings. As congregations continued to form during Russell's ministry, they each remained self-administrative, functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance. In 1881, Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society was presided over by William Henry Conley, and in 1884, Charles Taze Russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles. By about 1900, Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs, and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices. By the 1910s, Russell's organization maintained nearly a hundred \\"pilgrims,\\" or traveling preachers.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? does hold up pretty well","completion":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence, \\"does hold up pretty well,\\" is generally positive. To better understand and break down this sentiment, let's analyze the structure and the words used in the sentence. First, the verb \\"hold up\\" is an idiomatic expression used to describe how something bears up or maintains its value, quality, or effectiveness over time. In this context, it refers to how the movie continues to be enjoyable or praiseworthy. The fact that the reviewer chose this phrasing suggests that they believe the movie remains relevant and appealing, possibly defying expectations due to factors such as its age, time of release, or other factors. Second, the adverb \\"pretty\\" is employed as a modifier to the expression \\"hold up.\\" Used colloquially to mean \\"to a moderately high degree,\\" \\"pretty\\" serves to reinforce the notion that the movie not only holds up but does so to a significant extent. It underscores the reviewer's conviction that the movie remains more than just acceptable—it is relatively solid and respectable in quality. Third, the adverb \\"well\\" denotes the manner in which the movie holds up and provides an overall positive characterization. It implies that the movie's ability to endure is not only notable but also commendable. Combined with the other elements of the sentence, \\"well\\" contributes to the generally positive sentiment expressed by the reviewer. To sum up, the sentiment of the movie review sentence— \\"does hold up pretty well\\"— is mainly positive. The choice of language used by the reviewer conveys their assertion that the film retains its quality and appeal over time, succeeding in doing so to a noteworthy degree."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

The Bridgestone Arena is located in Nashville, Tennessee, and serves as the home of the Nashville Predators, an NHL team. The Predators were awarded the President's Trophy during the 2017-2018 season for finishing with the best overall regular-season record. The President's Trophy is primarily made of silver. More precisely, it is made of sterling silver, a silver alloy containing 92.5% by weight of silver and 7.5% by weight of other metals, usually copper. This silver alloy is renowned for its purity, durability, and appearance, making it an ideal choice for crafting prestigious awards and trophies. The trophy design features a large silver bowl on top, with the NHL logo and two crossed hockey sticks on the upper portion. The body of the trophy presents a map of North America, where all the cities with an NHL team are represented with a star.

John Anthony Gillis was born in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest of ten children--and the seventh son--of Teresa (nee Bandyk) and Gorman M. Gillis. His mother's family was Polish, while his father was Scottish-Canadian. He was raised a Catholic, and his father and mother both worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. Gillis became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of the Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, was fined 750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes. White has repeatedly referenced conflicts that erupted between him and fellow artists in Detroit's underground music scene after The White Stripes gained international success. In a 2006 interview with the Associated Press, he said that he eventually left Detroit because, \\"he could not take the negativity anymore.\\" However, in an effort to clarify his feelings towards the city of Detroit itself, he wrote and released a poem called \\"Courageous Dream's Concern.\\" In it, he expresses his affection for his hometown. During their 2013 divorce proceedings, Elson entered into evidence an e-mail White had sent her that included disparaging remarks about The Black Keys. When asked about the email in a 2014 Rolling Stone magazine interview, White stood by the remarks saying, \\"I'll hear TV commercials where the music's ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it's me. Half the time, it's the Black Keys.\\" He later apologized for the comments. However, in September 2015, Patrick Carney of the band posted a series of tweets alleging that White tried to fight him in a bar. White denied the claim in a statement to the online magazine Pitchfork, saying that Carney should talk to him directly, and not on the internet. The following day, Carney posted a tweet saying, \\"Talked to jack for an hour he's cool. All good.\\" White tweeted on the Third Man Twitter account, \\"From one musician to another, you have my respect Patrick Carney.\\" On February 1, 2015, the University of Oklahoma's newspaper OU Daily ran a story regarding White's February 2 show at McCasland Field House that included the publication of White's tour rider. The rider, especially the guacamole recipe it included and White's ban of bananas backstage, received significant media coverage. It was later reported that in response to the rider's publication White's booking agency, William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, had banned its acts from playing shows at the University of Oklahoma. On February 15 White released an open letter addressed to \\"journalists and other people looking for drama or a diva\\" in which he referred to the guacamole recipe as his tour manager's \\"inside joke with local promoters\\" and \\"just something to break up the boredom\\" while criticizing journalists who wrote about the rider as \\"out of their element.\\" In the same letter he forgave OU Daily for publishing the story and reaffirmed his desire to perform in Oklahoma. In October 2016--upon learning that Donald Trump had used the White Stripes' song \\"Seven Nation Army\\" in video campaign materials--White denounced the presidential candidate, and began selling shirts reading \\"Icky Trump\\" through the Third Man Records website.

The princess cut is a type of diamond cut that is particularly popular for engagement rings and other types of jewelry. Its square shape, with sharp corners and distinct faceting, sets it apart from other diamond cuts and makes it an ideal choice for those who prefer a more geometric appearance. Although the term \\"square diamonds\\" can potentially refer to any diamond cut that results in a square shape, the princess cut is one of the most commonly known square diamond cuts. Developed in the 1960s, the princess cut was created to maximize the brilliance and fire of a diamond, meaning that it reflects light more effectively than other square cuts, resulting in more sparkle. Other square cuts, such as the Asscher, cushion, or radiant, also exist.

Russia is like a sneaky kid who tried to secretly help one of the players in the game. People are not sure how much the sneaky kid's actions helped that player to win, but it's not very nice. The first question asks about how much the sneaky kid (Russia) affected the big game (US election). We don't know for sure if the sneaky kid's actions made a huge difference or not, but it's important to know if they did. The second question asks what happens if we find out that the sneaky kid (Russia) really did help one of the players (Donald Trump) in the big game (2016 US election). It wonders if that player (Donald Trump) would still be allowed to be a team leader.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk.

I voted -> Am votat Justification: I used the proper pronoun \\"Eu\\" (I) and the Romanian verb for \\"voted\\" (votat), making \\"Eu am votat\\". In Romanian, the pronoun can be omitted, so I shortened it to \\"Am votat\\". 2. Translate \\"to strengthen the OSCE\\" into Romanian. to strengthen -> pentru consolidarea the OSCE -> OSCE (no need to translate the acronym) Justification: \\"to strengthen\\" is translated to \\"pentru consolidarea\\", and OSCE is a well-known international organization and its acronym remains the same in Romanian. 3. Translate \\"which must be based on harmony between\\" into Romanian. which must be -> care trebuie să fie based on -> bazat pe harmony between -> armonia dintre Justification: \\"which must be\\" as \\"care trebuie să fie\\" is a relative clause, \\"based on\\" is translated to \\"bazat pe\\", and \\"harmony between\\" to \\"armonia dintre\\". 4.

He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales. He built custom-made instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described his theory and practice in his book Genesis of a Music (1947). Partch composed with scales dividing the octave into 43 unequal tones derived from the natural harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave. Supported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947. This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called Genesis of a Music. Genesis was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press. He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments. In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch to a studio. Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation, and did recordings, primarily of his Eleven Intrusions (1949-1950). He was assisted for six months by composer Ben Johnston, who performed on Partch's recordings. In spring 1951, Partch moved to Oakland for health reasons, and prepared for a production of King Oedipus at Mills College, with the support of designer Arch Lauterer. Performances of King Oedipus in March were extensively reviewed, but a planned recording was blocked by the Yeats estate, which refused to grant permission to use Yeats's translation. In February 1953, Partch founded the studio Gate 5 in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances. Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income. Partch's three Plectra and Percussion Dances, Ring Around the Moon (1949-1950), Castor and Pollux, and Even Wild Horses, premiered on Berkeley's KPFA radio in November 1953. After completing The Bewitched in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it. Ben Johnston introduced Danlee Mitchell to Partch at the University of Illinois; Mitchell later became Partch's heir. In March 1957, with the help of Johnston and the Fromm Foundation, The Bewitched was performed at the University of Illinois, and later at Washington University in St. Louis, though Partch was displeased with choreographer Alwin Nikolais's interpretation. Later in 1957, Partch provided the music for Madeline Tourtelot's film Windsong, the first of six film collaborations between the two. From 1959 to 1962, Partch received further appointments from the University of Illinois, and staged productions of Revelation in the Courthouse Park in 1961 and Water! Water! in 1962. Though these two works were based, as King Oedipus had been, on Greek mythology, they modernized the settings and incorporated elements of popular music. Partch had support from several departments and organizations at the university, but continuing hostility from the music department convinced him to leave and return to California. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Harry Partch was an American composer who made unique music using special scales and custom-designed musical instruments.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process, following the production of thousands or millions of new virus particles, is the release of these new virus particles and the subsequent infection of other healthy cells. This is achieved through a process called budding or, in some cases, cell lysis. In the budding process, the newly formed virus particles push against the host cell's membrane, causing the membrane to envelop them and form a protective layer around the virus. As the virus particles continue to push outwards, they eventually detach from the host cell in a viral envelope, leaving the cell membrane intact. The released virus particles, now enclosed in a viral envelope, can then go on to infect other healthy cells in the host organism. Alternatively, some viruses may cause cell lysis, which is the rupture and destruction of the host cell. In this process, the newly produced virus particles accumulate within the host cell, causing it to swell and eventually burst, releasing the virus particles into the surrounding environment. This not only spreads the virus to other cells but also damages and kills the host cell in the process. Overall, the last step in the process involves the release and dissemination of new virus particles, leading to further infection and spread of the flu virus within the host organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Most Roman towns and cities had a forum , temples and the same type of buildings, on a smaller scale, as found in Rome.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the given statement \\"Most Roman towns and cities had a forum, temples, and the same type of buildings, on a smaller scale, as found in Rome\\" is a reasonable answer in reference to the existence of marketplaces in ancient cities. The forum, in particular, was a key component of marketplaces in ancient Roman culture. However, it is important to note that marketplaces in ancient societies were not limited to Roman culture. Several ancient cultures around the world developed marketplaces to facilitate trade and commerce. Here is a more comprehensive answer: Ancient marketplaces were central locations where goods were exchanged between producers, consumers, and traders. A diverse array of ancient cultures had marketplaces, such as: 1. Mesopotamians: One of the earliest known civilizations, the Mesopotamians, developed marketplaces to facilitate trade and commerce. The ancient Sumerian city of Ur, for instance, functioned as a significant trade hub, with people exchanging goods, services, and even cultural ideas. 2. Ancient Egyptians: The ancient Egyptians also had marketplaces where traders brought their products, such as pottery, textiles, and food items, for exchange or sale. Marketplaces were essential in Egyptian cities like Thebes and Memphis. Transactions were often made through bartering or using the Egyptian currency, deben. 3. Ancient Greeks: The Greeks had a marketplace called agora. The agora was typically a central spot located within city-states, surrounded by institutional buildings. Both local craftsmen and traders across the Mediterranean would gather in the agora to sell their goods, while people also met there to discuss politics, philosophy, and other aspects of daily life. 4. Romans: As mentioned in the initial statement, Roman towns and cities had the forum, which served as a centralized marketplace. The forum was not only a place for trade but also a venue for socializing, discussing politics, and attending public events. Traders and individuals would gather at this location to buy, sell, or barter a variety of goods like food, clothes, and utility items. 5. Mesoamerican civilizations: The ancient Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Maya, Zapotec, and Aztec also had marketplaces. One notable example is the ancient market in the city of Tlatelolco, which was a significant trading center within the Aztec Empire. This marketplace attracted traders from across the empire and beyond, where goods such as cloth, food, ceramics, and even people were traded. 6. Ancient China: The ancient Chinese had marketplaces known as \\"shi.\\" The marketplaces were essential for both rural and urban areas in supporting the economy. Goods like textiles, porcelain, and metalware, and various agricultural products were traded at these bustling marketplaces. The Silk Road, connecting China to the Mediterranean, was a major trade route that further facilitated cultural exchange and commerce. In conclusion, ancient cultures such as Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Mesoamerican civilizations, and Chinese all had marketplaces that served as centers of trade, commerce, and community interaction.

(CNN) -- More than 65 people have been killed in two days of clashes between rebel groups and soldiers in Southern Sudan's Upper Nile state, an army spokesman said. Philip Aguer, spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) told CNN.com that forces loyal to a militia leader named Oliny attacked the village of Uach west of Malakal in Upper Nile state. \\"55 members of the militia and seven SPLA soldiers were killed, and we believe a number of civilians also died, but we are still getting information.\\" Oliny, Aguer said, is a former member of Southern Sudanese politician Lam Akol's militia. \\"But we don't know if he is still associated with him.\\" Aguer also said that he believes that Oliny was receiving military support from the government in northern Sudan. \\"They have received new weapons. We suspect they all acted in coordination with Khartoum ... I think things are going to continue escalating,\\" he said. However, Sudan's dominant National Congress Party (NCP) in the north denied having any involvement. Rabie Abdelati, an NCP party official, said on Monday: \\"If we really wanted to go back to war, we would not have signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (the 2005 accord) or accepted the referendum. \\"We are hoping for a strong south after secession. If the south is not stable the north will not be stable,\\" he said.

[-] negative; [-] positive; The answer is:","completion":"To determine whether the movie review sentence is negative or positive, let's analyze each element of the sentence. Step 1: Examine the words and their connotations - Drama: can have both positive and negative connotations, depending on how it is presented or received. - Conflict: tends to have a negative connotation, as it implies disagreement or discord. - Tears: can have a negative connotation, as they often represent sadness or pain, but can also indicate a strong emotional response, which can be positive. - Surprise: can have both positive and negative connotations but often is associated with an unexpected twist or turn in the movie. Step 2: Determine the overall tone Considering the mixture of potential positive and negative connotations in the sentence, it is difficult to definitively assign either a positive or negative label. However, because of the majority of the words having potentially negative connotations (conflict and tears), we can lean towards the movie review sentence being predominantly negative.

I parked my truck and decided to try and locate a telephone to see if the Florida Barber College had moved to a new location. After walking about a block I saw an open shoe store. I walked inside and asked if I could use their telephone book. Unable to find a listing for the Barber College, I picked out the number of a local beauty salon, hoping they might tell me if the barber college was still in business. The number was busy, so I decided to wait and try again in a few minutes.

I just smiled back and watched to see what would happen next. \\"What type of shoe would you like?\\" asked the clerk. \\"How about a pair of cowboy boots?\\" The man pointed to the back wall where three or four pairs of boots were displayed.

Television moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers. (Possible spoiler warning) The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic \\"caveman meets fluffball\\" yarn, where a \\"charming\\" red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs. The premises that the script's \\"wit\\" is based on must have already felt stale around 1950. It also contains some frankly bad writing, as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain, strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance. I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped all over it. In one sense, however, this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that landed Willis the job.

Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

Please briefly summarize this news article: George Michael jailed for eight weeks Blood tests showed he had chemicals linked to cannabis in his system. The singer sighed heavily as District Judge Perkins said he would serve four weeks in prison and spend the remainder on licence. Michael was also banned from driving for five years and ordered to pay a £1,250 fine, £100 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. One fan sobbed in the public gallery as he was taken down from the dock by security guards. Michael's guilty plea and remorse allowed District Judge Perkins to reduce the sentence, he said, but not to offer the community sentence requested by the defence. Michael was arrested in Hampstead shortly before 4am on July 4 when two police officers found him apparently unconscious in his grey Range Rover in Rosslyn Hill. When told he had crashed into a shop, he added: \\"No I didn't. I didn't crash into anything.\\" At Hampstead police station he failed a test to find whether he was fit to drive. The musician admitted smoking a \\"small quantity\\" of cannabis about 10pm the previous evening and said he also took the anti-depressant Amitriptyline to help him sleep. He told police he decided to drive between his homes in Highgate and Hampstead to meet a friend and forgot he had taken the sedative. District Judge Perkins said: \\"You drove your motor vehicle about a mile while suffering from a severe impairment as a result of mixing not only a prescription treatment with which you were unfamiliar but also with cannabis. \\"That's a dangerous and unpredictable mix and something which for you is dangerous given your record. \\"It does not appear that you took proper steps to deal with what is clearly an addiction to cannabis. \\"That's a mistake which puts you and, on this occasion, the public at risk.\\" The district judge said he took into account that Michael had checked into a clinic after the crash to seek help for anxiety, depression and insomnia, which had led him to depend on prescription drugs and had noted he was dealing with bereavement issues. \\"I accept entirely that you have shown remorse for the offence, that you are ashamed of it, that you admitted it,\\" he said, but added that \\"with regret\\" a jail term was inevitable because of Michael's previous conviction. Michael's long-term partner Kenny Goss threw his head into his hands in despair at that point. Mukul Chawla QC, mitigating, said Michael personally repaid the cost of the damage to the shop owner and had asked that his \\"profound shame and horror of having repeated the conduct of 2006\\" was made clear to the court. \\"He acknowledges his actions of driving had the effect of causing other road users to be in danger and that stark fact is something about which he is greatly ashamed. \\"The prospect he could have put anyone else in danger is an appalling prospect to him.\\" He said Michael had tried to turn his life around. \\"For the first time in many years he has started writing again. His creativity, so long hampered by his drug dependence, is re-emerging.\\" Mr Chawla said Michael had tried to come off prescription drugs without professional help earlier this year but symptoms returned so he sought medical help and was given Amitriptyline. Michael remained an outpatient at the rehab clinic, he added. The singer, wearing a charcoal suit with a black tie, spoke only to confirm his name and address and to say he would prefer to be addressed by his stage name. The jail sentence is the culmination of a long line of clashes with the law for the singer, who has been open about his use of cannabis and claimed in the past that he was trying to cut down. Michael was banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service after he was convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes in 2006. He was cautioned twice in 2006 for possession of cannabis and cautioned for possession for crack cocaine and cannabis two years later. He was fined for \\"engaging in a lewd act\\" in a California public toilet in 1998. Fans gathered outside the court to get a glimpse of the star, screaming his name and trying to break through a barrier of 12 police officers as he arrived at court this afternoon. One fan passed a good luck card for Michael to Mr Goss. Shelly Williams, 41, from east London, sobbed from the public gallery as Michael was sentenced. \\"I have been a fan for 26 years - that's longer than a marriage. \\"I hope he continues with the process of making himself better.\\" Summary:","completion":"Singer George Michael has been jailed for eight weeks after being found unconscious in his car due to the influence of cannabis and a sedative.

Paragraph: Porky is looking all over the big city for a hotel room , but due to a convention there are no vacancies . Porky takes the only available vacancy at one hotel , but will have to share with Daffy Duck , who is a very loud , obnoxious and annoying sort . Daffy introduces his invisible kangaroo friend \`\` Hymie '' , but Porky wo n't believe that . Daffy spends the rest of the night annoying Porky : pestering him with questions , shaking the bed , spilling water from a glass , hogging the blanket and finally literally sending the both of them flying off the bed when Daffy kicks , and startles , Porky with his literally frozen feet . Fed up with his antics , Porky stuffs Daffy in a pillow case and drops him out of the window . As Porky goes back to bed , Daffy returns bandaged , but shakes them off and prepares to get revenge .

Although Daffy is indeed obnoxious, makes messes, and sees things, these are quite vague descriptions that do not accurately describe the experiences Porky has. In specifics, Porky's problems while sharing a room with Daffy stem not just from Daffy's messy and annoying behavior but also his involvements in a number of antics. Daffy introduces his invisible kangaroo friend \\"Hymie\\" which contributes to his disturbance. Also, he pesters Porky with questions, shakes the bed, spills water from a glass, hogs the blanket, and ends up making both of them fly off the bed when he kicks Porky with his literally frozen feet. Moreover, Daffy, seeking revenge after Porky throws him out of the room, tricks a half-asleep Porky into stepping out of a window by making him believe it's a train. Then, when Porky is actually taken away by a train, Daffy acts even more absurdly, bouncing around the room and hoo-hoo-ing wildly. These series of actions not just stem from his obnoxious behavior but also depict a complete disregard for Porky's comfort and need for rest, illustrating a more complete picture of Porky's problems with Daffy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: The last two stages of aerobic respiration require what? A: Possible answers: -water. -carbon. -sulfur. -oxygen. Answer:","completion":"The last two stages of aerobic respiration require oxygen. Aerobic respiration is a process in which cells produce energy through the oxidation of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, in the presence of oxygen. This energy-generating process consists of four sequential stages: glycolysis, the preparatory phase, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Among these, the final two stages - the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain - specifically require oxygen for their proper functioning. 1. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): This is the third stage of aerobic respiration that occurs within the mitochondrial matrix in eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells. The primary purpose of the citric acid cycle is to generate high-energy electron carriers, such as NADH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FADH2 (Flavin adenine dinucleotide), and a small amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate). While oxygen is not directly involved in any reaction of the citric acid cycle, it plays a critical role in the continuous regeneration of the oxidized forms of the electron carriers (NAD+ and FAD), which are necessary to maintain the cycle's ongoing processes. In the absence of oxygen, these electron carriers cannot be regenerated, and the citric acid cycle ceases to function effectively. 2. Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation: This is the final stage of aerobic respiration, which takes place within the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. The electron transport chain is a series of complex protein structures responsible for transferring electrons from the high-energy electron carriers, NADH and FADH2, generated in the previous stages, to molecular oxygen. The energy released during this electron transfer process is utilized to pump protons (H+) across the membrane, establishing a proton gradient. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in this process, and its role is essential for the completion of the electron transport chain. In the oxidative phosphorylation step, the ATP synthase enzyme uses the potential energy from the proton gradient to catalyze the synthesis of ATP from ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate. Molecular oxygen is reduced to water during this process. In summary, the last two stages of aerobic respiration, the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain, require oxygen for the regeneration of electron carriers and as the essential final electron acceptor, respectively. Oxygen's critical role in these processes highlights the reason why it is called \\"aerobic respiration.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Solve -124*t - 196 + 49 = -103*t for t.","completion":"To solve the equation -124*t - 196 + 49 = -103*t for t, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, we can simplify by combining the constants -196 and +49. -196 + 49 = -147 So the simplified equation is: -124*t - 147 = -103*t Step 2: Isolate the variable t by getting all terms containing t on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 103*t to both sides of the equation to move the -103*t term to the left side. -124*t - 147 + 103*t = -103*t + 103*t This simplifies to: -21*t - 147 = 0 Step 3: Now, isolate the t term further by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we can add 147 to both sides of the equation to move the -147 term to the right side. -21*t - 147 + 147 = 0 + 147 This simplifies to: -21*t = 147 Step 4: Solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by -21. -21*t / -21 = 147 / -21 t = -7 So the solution to the equation is t = -7."},{"prompt":"Is this product review positive?

At a historic news conference, Mr Castro said if he was given a list of political prisoners, he would \\"release them tonight\\". The White House has said it has given Cuba lists of dissidents in the past. Mr Castro does not view the prisoners as dissidents, US officials said. That disagreement is central to the conflict between US and Cuban officials. More needs to be done to lift the US embargo on trade with Cuba, Mr Castro said, adding that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp must close. Mr Obama, the first serving US president to visit Cuba since 1959, said the trade embargo would be fully lifted. \\"Cuba's destiny will not be decided by the United States or any other nation... The future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans not by anybody else,\\" Mr Obama said. Mr Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were later welcomed at a state dinner, along with some members of US Congress and senior White House staff. The Failde Youth Band entertained the guests, who dined on shrimp mousse, cream soup flavoured with rum, and traditional pork with rice and plantain chips. Waiters passed round Cuban cigars after dinner. Earlier on Monday, Mr Castro defended Cuba's record on human rights and pointed to problems in the US. \\"We defend human rights, in our view civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are indivisible, inter-dependent and universal,\\" Mr Castro said. Mr Castro is not usually subject to any aggressive questioning from reporters and called the prisoners question \\"not polite\\", later ending the news conference by saying \\"I think this is enough\\". \\"Actually we find it inconceivable that a government does not defend and ensure the right to healthcare, education, social security, food provision and development,\\" he said. Speaking to ABC News after the conference with Mr Castro, Mr Obama did not directly say he would be giving Mr Castro a list of political prisoners. \\"We have given them a lists in the past and they have responded intermittently to our engagement,\\" he said. \\"And this I think is an example of why it was my belief that this would be a more successful mechanism for us to advance the values that we care about than an embargo and silence and no communications.\\" President Obama and his aides hoped that the Cuban President, Raul Castro, would approach the news conference with an open mind. The White House officials also hoped that Mr Castro would be receptive to new ideas and to new ways of doing things. Specifically, the US officials hoped that he'd take questions from reporters. Surprisingly enough, he did, marking a departure from his past. The two men joked around during the question-and-answer period, and they worked out some of their differences. When one of Mr Castro's aides interrupted his boss during the conference, for example, Mr Obama looked annoyed. But he and Mr Castro moved on, talking about the future of Cuba. In a similar way, Mr Obama and his aides hope they can overcome other issues, including difficult ones such as human rights, as they forge a new relationship between the two countries. Mr Obama could not say exactly when the trade embargo would be lifted, but recognised it was necessary. \\"The reason is what we did for 50 years did not serve our interests or the interests of the Cuban people,\\" he said. His administration has done what it can on lifting trade restrictions, he said, but further action will require Congress which is \\"not as productive in an election year\\". He also said further easing of the trade embargo will depend on actions Cuba takes on human rights. Six sticking points to better relations - Guantanamo Bay, human rights and media freedoms are among the unresolved issues Cuba's DIY economy - A new generation of Cuban entrepreneurs are launching private businesses Internet access still restricted in Cuba - Only about 5% of Cubans have web access at home Mr Obama said it is not just Cuba that the US has \\"deep disagreements\\" about human rights with - it also has disagreements with China and Vietnam. \\"I believe if I engage frankly, clearly, stating our beliefs but I can't force change on any country - it ultimately has to come from within - that is a more useful strategy,\\" he said. \\"I have faith in people\\". Reporters described the press conference as \\"tense\\" and \\"remarkable\\". Karla Olivares, an independent journalist from Cuba, told the BBC that Mr Castro \\"talked more than usual\\" and the claim that Cuba does not have any political prisoners was \\"complicated\\".

Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the University, establishing the School of Medicine. During the 1890s, Robert Sommers Brookings, the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus. A:","completion":"The law school opened earlier. In the context, it states that the university opened the first private nonsectarian law school west of the Mississippi River in 1867. Medical classes, which are part of the University, were first held in 1891.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What song has mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass solo at half-tempo? \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus. It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". \\"Orion\\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with...

Q:The answer to the question: What is the name of the band that started a tour in West Germany? is inside the article: By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

A 16-year-old North Carolina girl who disappeared while visiting family in Baltimore continues to be the object of an intense search by authorities, who now say they fear she was abducted or harmed. \\"We are enormously concerned,\\" Baltimore police spokesman Anthony J. Guglielmi said Friday. \\"Every day that passes we get more and more freaked out.\\" Phylicia Barnes, a Charlotte, North Carolina, resident who was in Baltimore to visit her college-age half-sister, was last seen December 28, after saying she was going out to get something to eat and maybe a haircut, Guglielmi said. As recently as Tuesday, police said they had no evidence that foul play was involved in her disappearance. But now they say she has not made contact with friends or family, and hasn't turned on her cell phone, used an ATM or updated her social media sites since she disappeared. The FBI did a profile on the girl and found no reason she would run away, Guglielmi said. She is a good student with no emotional disturbances in her life, he said. \\"The fact set of this case is different than anything else we've seen,\\" he said. More than 100 Baltimore police, Maryland State Police troopers and FBI agents have been working around the clock to find out what happened to Barnes, Guglielmi said. Police have questioned a dozen people believed to have had contact with her in the hours before she disappeared, and have searched the homes and cars of some of those people, he said. They also have collected 40 hours of video from surveillance cameras at nearby businesses and apartment buildings, but neither those videos nor searches conducted in two locations have helped give investigators any leads, Guglielmi said. On Thursday, they turned to posting billboards along I-95 in hope of gathering information about the girl's fate. \\"What's going to break this thing wide open is that somebody, whether it's (in) Kansas or Canada, is going to say, wait a minute, I just saw her in a diner,\\" Guglielmi said Friday. \\"That's in the best case.\\" Although Guglielmi said there was no evidence of illegal drug use at the apartment, the girl's mother, Janice Sallis, said she has been told the girl may have been allowed to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana at her half-sister's apartment, according to CNN and CNN affiliate WSOC. Sallis said she had been told up to 20 men had come and gone while her daughter was there. \\"I pray to God that my daughter is fine and she'll be found safe,\\" Barnes' father, Russell Barnes, told CNN affiliate WBAL. \\"I hope people keep praying as high as they can and understand that this shouldn't happen to any child anywhere in this country.\\" Anyone with information on Barnes' disappearance can call 855-223-0033.

The game was the eleventh consecutive primetime game between the two and the sixth in Green Bay, with the Bears winning two of the last three. Entering week seven, the Bears led the all-time series 93-91-6. In the teams' last meetings since the turn of the decade, the Bears had lost all but three games, including the most recent game in 2015, a 17-13 victory in Green Bay. The Bears were struggling to score in 2016, averaging a league-worst 16.8 points per game. As such, Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears needed to score touchdowns, especially considering their struggles in the red zone (on 19 trips to the region, the Bears scored only nine times). Outside of the red zone, the Bears scored only 10 points; in comparison, the NFL average was 37. Chicago's rushing attack faced a Green Bay defense that allowed only eight runs of at least ten yards and 3.4 yards on first down, the third-lowest in the league. On defense, the Bears faced Aaron Rodgers; while the Packers offense was only 26th in yardage and at -3 in turnover ratio, the unit led the league in third down completion percentage. Rodgers also excelled in the first quarter of games, where he had thrown four touchdown passes, good for second in the league, and a 106 passer rating. However, the Packers struggled on drives starting within their own 20-yard line, failing to score on 14 such drives, the only team unable to do so. Joniak also wrote the team needed a \\"spark\\"; defeating the Packers at Lambeau for the second straight season would \\"do wonders for a young team trying to find its way.\\" After the Bears punted on the opening drive, the Packers took the lead first with Mason Crosby's 32-yard field goal. The Bears were forced to punt again on their next series and the Packers reached as far as the Bears' one-yard line before they were stopped on fourth down. On Chicago's resulting drive, Brian Hoyer was hit by Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers while throwing a pass, breaking his left arm. With Jay Cutler also inactive, third-string quarterback Matt Barkley took over for the next possession. With Barkley, the Bears were able to score points via Connor Barth's 39-yard field goal, which the Packers responded with Crosby's 40-yard kick. On Green Bay's first drive of the second half, Leonard Floyd strip-sacked Rodgers, recovering the fumble in the endzone to give the Bears the 10-6 lead. The score marked the Bears' first defensive touchdown since 2014. Rodgers overcame the play by throwing a five-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams, followed by two more touchdown passes to Adams and Randall Cobb of four and two yards, respectively (though Crosby missed an extra point). Down 26-10, the Bears' next two series ended with interceptions, Barkley being intercepted by Blake Martinez and Nick Perry. The 1-6 start marked the first start with such a record since 2000.

To add a touch of elegance, place a stencil or paper cutout over the cupcake before sprinkling the powdered sugar, and then carefully remove it, leaving a beautiful design behind. 2. Glazes and drizzles: Replace frosting with a simple glaze or drizzle, such as a chocolate ganache, caramel, or a fruit-based glaze like strawberry or lemon. Pour or drizzle your choice of glaze over the cupcake for an attractive, glossy finish. 3. Nut or seed sprinkles: Finely chop nuts like almonds, pistachios, or pecans, and sprinkle them over your cupcake for a crunchy texture and added flavor. Alternatively, you can use seeds like chia, sunflower, or sesame seeds as a topping. 4. Edible flowers: Choose organic, pesticide-free edible flowers, like roses, violets, or pansies, and use them as a colorful and elegant decoration for your cupcake. Ensure to use only edible flowers and avoid any that may cause an allergic reaction. 5. Fruit toppings: Fresh fruit adds a burst of flavor and visual appeal. You can use a single fruit, like a raspberry, blueberry, or strawberry, or create a mixture of colorful fruit pieces like kiwi, orange, and mango. 6. Chocolate shavings or curls: Use a vegetable peeler to shave or curl chocolate from a chocolate bar or block, and then sprinkle them atop the cupcakes for a luxurious touch. Choose from dark, milk, or white chocolate to complement your cupcake flavor. 7. Cookie crumbs or crushed candies: Crush cookies like graham crackers, Oreo, Amaretti, or Biscoff and sprinkle them over your cupcake for an added texture. You can also crush candies such as peppermint, toffee, or chocolate-covered nuts for a fun and flavorful decoration. 8. Coconut flakes: Toasted or untoasted coconut flakes make for a beautiful and tasty topping. You can use shredded coconut or larger flaked coconut to add different textures, and you can even toss the coconut in food coloring for a pop of color. 9. Spices or zest: Add a dash of cinnamon, cocoa powder, or nutmeg to your cupcake for a simple and flavorful decoration. In addition, citrus zests like lemon, orange, or lime can lend a fresh, fragrant touch. 10. Miniature versions of your cupcake's main ingredient: If you have a standout ingredient in your cupcake, like chocolate chips, maraschino cherries, or raisins, place a miniature version on top as a finishing touch. These ideas will help you accomplish your goal of decorating your cupcake without using frosting. You can also mix and match multiple elements from the list for a unique and more intricate cupcake design. Furthermore, always consider the cupcake's flavor when selecting your decorations, as this will help ensure a cohesive and delicious final product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Graduel Christopher Darin Carter (born November 25, 1965) is a former American football player in the National Football League. He was a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles (1987-89), the Minnesota Vikings (1990-2001) and the Miami Dolphins (2002). After starting for the Ohio State University Buckeyes, Carter was drafted by the Eagles in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft. While in Philadelphia, head coach Buddy Ryan helped to coin one of ESPN's Chris Berman's famous quotes about Carter: \\"All he does is catch touchdowns.\\" Context: Carter was heavily recruited out of high school for both basketball and football. He accepted the offer from Ohio State head coach Earle Bruce. Carter became a consensus All-America selection after his junior season, Ohio State's first All American at wide receiver. Carter had intended to play both football and basketball at Ohio State, but decided to focus on football after making an immediate impact his freshman year. That year, he set a Rose Bowl record with nine receptions for 172 yards. Carter was known for great hands, running precise routes, and for acrobatic leaps. He had remarkable body control and footwork when making catches near the sidelines. At the Citrus Bowl at the end of the 1985 season, Carter caught a ball that quarterback Jim Karsatos was intending to throw away. Karsatos has claimed that catch by Carter was the greatest in the history of college football: \\"When I finally saw it on film, he was tiptoeing the sidelines and he jumped up and caught the ball left-handed by the point of the football at least a yard out of bounds. Then he somehow levitated back in bounds to get both his feet in bounds. I swear to this day he actually levitated to get back in bounds. When I saw it on film, it just blew me away.\\" Prior to Carter's senior season, he secretly signed with notorious sports agent Norby Walters. When the contract was discovered, Carter was ruled ineligible. The absence of Carter in the 1987 offense contributed to a disappointing 6-4-1 season and the firing of Coach Bruce. Missing this season also cost him a chance at evening his personal record against Michigan; Carter finished 1-2, his lone taste of victory in the series being his freshman year. Despite losing his senior year, Carter left Ohio State holding the school record for receptions (168). In 2000, he was selected as a member of the Ohio State Football All-Century Team. In 2003, he was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame. Question: Where did Carter attend college?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Carter attended college at Ohio State University.

Information: - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - Antonio Vagnozzi is an amateur Italian astronomer . He is a prolific discoverer of asteroids . - Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term \\"asteroid\\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter. - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures. - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.

Macreedy (Spencer Tracy) gets off a passenger train at the isolated desert hamlet of Black Rock. It is the first time in four years that the train has stopped there. Macreedy is looking for a man named Komoko, but the few residents are inexplicably hostile. The young hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth (John Ericson), claims he has no vacant rooms. Macreedy is threatened by Hector David (Lee Marvin). Later, Reno Smith (Robert Ryan) informs Macreedy that Komoko, a Japanese-American, was interned during World War II. Certain that something is wrong, Macreedy sees the local sheriff, Tim Horn (Dean Jagger), but the alcoholic lawman is clearly afraid of Smith and is impotent to help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie (Walter Brennan), advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but also lets slip that Komoko is dead. Pete's sister, Liz (Anne Francis), rents Macreedy a Jeep. He drives to nearby Adobe Flat, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground and wildflowers. On the way back, Coley Trimble (Ernest Borgnine) tries to run him off the road. When Smith asks, Macreedy reveals he lost his left arm fighting in Italy. Macreedy says the wildflowers at the Komoko place lead him to suspect that a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist in the Marines the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but failed the physical. Macreedy tries to telephone the state police, but Pete refuses to put the call through. Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago and that Smith has everyone too terrified to speak up. Velie offers Macreedy his hearse to leave town. Hector rips out the distributor cap and spark plug wires. Macreedy goes to Hastings' (Russell Collins) telegraph office and writes a telegram addressed to the state police.

Review title: Dumb CD Product review: This CD has NOTHING to do with communism. The music doesn't even sound very good. None of the lyrics even come close to having a communist message. I gave it 2 stars because some of the techno beats were relatively ok. In my opinion, techno/electronica/house is the perfect music for a communist society... it's modern, progressive, intense, and a lot of fun, but it's not subversive or nasty like heavy metal or rap. Music should fulfill people's 'fun' need without making them want to hurt someone.Mike (mlferrini@sbcglobal.net) Answer:","completion":"The following review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product for several reasons. 1. The reviewer states that the CD has nothing to do with communism, which may indicate that the product description or marketing for the CD was misleading. If I were specifically looking for music related to or inspired by communism, this review would immediately make me question the product's relevance to my interests. 2. The music itself is described as not sounding very good, which may indicate that the quality of the musical compositions is poor. 3. Despite the reviewer giving the CD 2 stars because of some enjoyable techno beats, they also express dissatisfaction with the absence of a communist message in the lyrics. This implies that the reviewer expected such a theme and was disappointed by not finding it in the music. If I were specifically looking for music with a communist message, this review would significantly decrease my chances of buying the product. 4.

Please answer the following question: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than 14,000 kilometres (8,700Â mi) in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to court as many women as will fall for his pick-up lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened La Poderosa (\\"The Mighty One\\"). Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, and don't make it to Caracas until July.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Patrick Stewart: 'I can store emotions. No experience is ever wasted' If I were a Trekkie, as opposed to someone who enjoyed Star Trek but was never a true devotee, I would surely have died and gone to heaven early on in my lunch with Patrick Stewart. Or, as a Trekkie might put it, I would have beamed up to the pleasure planet Risa, 90 light years from the Sol system, where the weather is always perfect, the beaches always immaculate, and love forever free. Our lunch ascends to Star Trek nirvana when we are barely into the 15th minute of our almost two-hour conversation. We are musing about the surprising linguistic affinities between Treknobabble and Shakespearean iambic pentameter – both of which Stewart is fluent in, having spent sizeable chunks of his five decades in acting immersed in them. \\"There are lots of similarities,\\" he says. Then, with a mischievous glint in his eye, Stewart leans his famously bald pate towards me, over our dishes of Cobb salad, and says: \\"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise, its continuing mission to seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldly go where no one has gone before.\\" \\"You see! It has a poetic flow!\\" he exclaims, before adding quickly: \\"I swear to you, I haven't said those words for years and years and years. I wasn't sure I'd remember them.\\" (I don't have the heart to tell him that he has actually got it slightly wrong and forgotten an important clause of Star Trek mission – \\"to explore strange new worlds\\".) How to explain Stewart's rare slip back into the voice of the Starfleet captain? Perhaps he's relaxed because he's on home turf. We meet in one of the nicer restaurants in Brooklyn, close to his New York home. When I turn up early I am ushered to \\"Mr Stewart's regular table\\", located discreetly at the back. Stewart sweeps in precisely at the allotted hour, dressed all in black and disguised only by a working man's flat cap. He shakes my hand firmly and looks me straight in the eye. Not for the only time in our encounter he makes me think of a military officer.The other possible explanation for Stewart's revival of Picard in front of an audience of one is that he seems to be in right royal good spirits. And why wouldn't he be? As he approaches his 74th birthday, he is firing on all cylinders. Far from showing any signs of engine fatigue, for the lad from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, life and work just seem to get better and better. In September he married his third wife, singer-songwriter Sunny Ozell, and they live in a converted carriage house in the heart of Park Slope, one of Brooklyn's most fashionable neighbourhoods. And he's just come off a critically acclaimed double run on Broadway of No Man's Land and Waiting for Godot with his bestie Ian McKellen, who officiated at their wedding. The two actors are reunited this month in the new X-Men movie, Days of Future Past; and Stewart also appears in an indie film called Match which premiered at the Tribeca film festival. If that's not enough, just as we're finishing up our salads, the news breaks that he is to star in a 20-episode series of half-hour TV comedies conceived by Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane. Did I omit to say that in the past 18 months he's erupted into a global Twitter phenomenon, with 1.2m followers? (A halloween Twitpic of him dressed as a red lobster lying in the bath was retweeted 40,000 times.) With all that to go at, it's hard to know where to begin. Might as well launch straight in with the unlikely parallels between Star Trek, the vehicle that propelled him to fame, and his ongoing love affair with Shakespeare. A few weeks into shooting Star Trek: Next Generation Stewart had a eureka moment. He was sitting in the captain's chair in the bridge of the starship Enterprise when he suddenly saw himself back in his old milieu: \\"I realised that the set actually represented very much an Elizabethan stage, with the main acting area in the centre front, a raised area at the back, two vomitoria entrances low down. It was classic.\\" At 47, Stewart already had an accomplished career behind him with the Royal Shakespeare Company, but was unknown in Hollywood when one of the Star Trek producers saw him at a Shakespeare workshop at UCLA. \\"I'd never seen myself especially as a film or television actor, let alone sci-fi,\\" says Stewart. \\"I went to LA to do it after I was assured the six-year contract I signed would never be called upon to be met; I was convinced we wouldn't even make it through the first season.\\" Seven seasons, 178 episodes, four feature films and plenty of Spandex later, Stewart emerged, to his own astonishment, as a Hollywood superstar. The exceptional quality about Stewart's work is that he has managed to keep his profile high in the film firmament while at the same time growing and deepening a distinguished theatrical career. Few other actors come to mind who have pulled off such a juggling act. Yes, the Ethan Hawkes and Denzel Washingtons may dabble with Broadway, but Patrick Stewart is one of a rare breed that can neither be called a film star or a stage actor – because he is both. I wonder aloud whether it's more than coincidental, that perhaps there's something to the classical British thespian training that he enjoyed that produces actors peculiarly equipped to excel across stage and screen. Stewart eagerly concurs. \\"I absolutely believe that's what it is. It's a feeling for language, a feeling for drama that is something a little more than totally naturalistic. I use this word a lot: 'heightened'.\\" He expresses his gratitude to the retired Old Vic actor who trained him between the ages of 12 and 17, and to Peter Hall, John Barton and Trevor Nunn at whose feet he sat when he joined the RSC, in awe at \\"their immense knowledge and experience of Shakespearean language. I never knew you could speak Shakespeare in a way that was totally spontaneous and poetic at the same time.\\" He likens himself to a Leeds United football player in Don Revie's day. \\"He had trained those buggers so intensely throughout the week that at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon those 11 players would run on to the pitch totally liberated, free to do what they wanted to do, having done the work.\\" As further evidence that none of this is coincidental, the other great straddler between theatre and franchise films is none other than Stewart's best friend, Ian McKellen. That the two knighted British actors have forged a deep friendship is abundantly clear from Stewart's effervescent Twitter feed. To mark their Broadway double-act last autumn they instigated the Twitter equivalent of a riot, taking selfies in iconic NYC places – the top of the Empire State Building, on the boardwalk in Coney Island – wearing Godot-esque bowler hats and looking more than a little deranged. What booms out of the photos is how much fun they are having in each other's company. The bromance returns with X-Men: Days of Future Past. This time, the two thespian lions are allies both on and off the camera. In previous X-Men films, Stewart's character, Professor Charles Xavier, has been at loggerheads with McKellen's Magneto. The two characters are both mutants, but they occupy opposing political extremes. Xavier is the moderate negotiator who prefers talk over battle; Magneto is a fighter and revolutionary. But in Days of Future Past the two are thrown on to the same side by the common threat of enemy machines. \\"When the film begins we are in a situation where Xavier has had to decide that force is the only way forward,\\" Stewart says. \\"He is pushed into Magneto's camp and they become collaborators. We are dealing with machines and not human beings, so argument, persuasion, is no longer an option.\\" We are at a disadvantage to dig much deeper with X-Men, given that the 11th-hour final production work on the film means neither of us has yet seen it. But we can stick with the theme of persuasion versus force as it also runs through Stewart's second new film this spring, Match – an intimate, touching portrait set in Manhattan of a gay, dope-smoking, knitting, TV soap-watching and rather lonely classical ballet teacher called Tobi, who has an encounter with a married couple, strangers who as the narrative unfolds require him to confront the choices of his past. Stewart is stupendous, displaying a breathtaking range of emotional shades and dramatic tones. He is funny one minute, enraged the next, then cathartic and profoundly moving. I ask him how he managed to capture so convincingly the historic conflicts Tobi wrestles with – such as the character's decision to devote his life to career and as a result forego having a child. \\"For many years I was making choices like that every day,\\" he says, referring to his relationship with his children, Daniel and Sophia, by his first wife Sheila Falconer. \\"As my responsibilities in the theatre grew, I was gone from nine in the morning until midnight. I was an absentee father, largely, and there was a price to be paid for that down the road.\\" He actively channelled such emotional conflicts into conjuring up Tobi. \\"Actors, we have this thing called a 'sense memory' which we draw on for particularly emotional moments. We have these things stored away in a vault and we can draw them out when we need to.\\" Like a filing cabinet of emotions, I suggest. \\"That's right. That was part of my training at Bristol Old Vic theatre school. We were taught how to store emotions. It means no experience is ever wasted.\\" If the regret of being an absentee dad has provided him with a valuable emotional file or two, then his relationship with his own father must have filled the sense memory equivalent of the NSA's mass surveillance database in Utah. Alfred Stewart, a regimental sergeant major in the British army, was a troubled soul who, after retiring from the armed forces, suffered post traumatic stress disorder. At weekends it came bursting out in drunken assaults on his wife, Gladys. The sense memory is all too viscerally visible here. At one of the pivotal moments in Match, Tobi places himself physically between the married strangers, played by Matthew Lillard and Carla Gugino, acting as a human shield. \\"Don't take another step! Not another step!\\" Tobi bellows at the husband, who is poised to strike his wife. It's an astonishing moment. Stewart unleashes himself with such explosive charge that the whole cinema feels as though it is quaking. I remind Stewart of that point in the film, and of the haunting piece he wrote for the Guardian in 2009 in which he describes his father's domestic violence through his then child's eyes. \\"I knew exactly when the shouting was done and a hand was about to be raised – I also knew exactly when to insert a small body between the fist and her face, a skill no child should ever learn.\\" It's the same incident, I remark. He pauses for a second, and then says only this: \\"You reach a choice moment where you say, 'That's enough. I'm not going to be a spectator in this any more.'\\" The paradox about Stewart's fraught relationship with his father, who used to mock his son's fondness for theatre remorselessly, is that he's come to appreciate over the years how much he is in his father's debt in terms of his acting career. Take Picard and Xavier. Both of them stand for non-violence and peace and, as such, are arguably polar opposites to Alfred. But both of them are leaders, commanders –very much in Alfred's military mould. \\"It's a source of sadness to me that my father never lived to see me do Star Trek,\\" he says. \\"Because he would have approved of what I was doing and how I used the role. I mean, books have been written about Picard's command style. It's taught in the military academy!\\" It sounds like there will be more than a sprinkling of Alfred Stewart in Patrick's new adventure, Blunt Talk – the upcoming Seth MacFarlane comedy series that will be broadcast on Starz next year. Stewart will play Walter Blunt, a working-class lad from the north of England with a military background and a career in TV news who gets shipped off to LA to front a cable news programme called Blunt Talk. \\"You are going to think right away about Piers Morgan, but you mustn't!\\" Stewart says emphatically. \\"When we meet Blunt his show is no longer doing well, the numbers are dreadful and his career is in crisis.\\" OK, now I am thinking Piers Morgan. Can't help it. \\"He just keeps falling into these tailspins. One after another. It's completely realistic and truthful. This is not a gag show, it's not one-liners. It's single camera on film – we'll be making a half-hour movie every six days.\\" With all that ahead, I say, he's not coming home to the UK any time soon. Stewart responds that he has a lovely house in Britain that he adores, and that he intends to spend as much time as possible in the mother country. But on this point he is resolute: \\"I am a resident of the United States.\\" He has even, he says, started for the first time thinking seriously about taking up American citizenship. It's partly the recent marriage to Ozell and how embraced he feels by her family. And it's partly a sense of political frustration at not having a vote in America. \\"It's long overdue,\\" he says. \\"There's only so much I can do, only so much I can comment on.\\" Before we polish off the salads, I ask Stewart whether he ever fears, in those dark hours, that all the cornucopia, the largesse, the riches of his life that seem to just keep on giving will one day dry up. \\"I don't have those kind of dark hours, except where health is concerned,\\" he says. \\"I've had two major scares in the past 10 years – one with heart, one with cancer – both of them taken care of.\\" We both, in unison, start knocking on wood. And then, as the waiter clears away our plates, Patrick Stewart launches into one final tale, this one about McKellen and how, as they waited for the curtain to go up for No Man's Land, they would moan and moan about their ailments. \\"Nobody would believe it. Here were Magneto and Charles Xavier, these power-houses, griping about their aches and pains.\\" He recalls one particular performance when Sir Ian and Sir Patrick, giants of the English stage, were sitting behind the curtain just before the start. \\"Ian was telling me about his experience with catheters. The call came: \\"We're going up!\\" The curtain rose, the lights went on, and we were both chuckling about catheters. That made for a slightly different show.\\" X-Men: Days of Future Past is released on 22 May What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is an interview with actor Patrick Stewart, who discusses his acting career, experiences in roles such as Star Trek's Captain Picard, and his relationships with other actors like Ian McKellen.

(A). yes; (B). no; Does \\"In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term \\"energy\\" instead of vis viva, in its modern sense.\\" correctly answer the question of When was the law of conservation of energy first postulated?","completion":"No, the statement \\"In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term 'energy' instead of vis viva, in its modern sense\\" does not correctly answer the question of when the law of conservation of energy was first postulated. The statement only addresses the introduction of the term \\"energy\\" in its modern sense by Thomas Young. The law of conservation of energy, also known as the first law of thermodynamics, states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. To fully address this question, we need to discuss the various figures, concepts, and historical events that led to the development and understanding of the law of conservation of energy. The evolution of this law can be traced back to the works of several scientists and thinkers through history. 1. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716): Leibniz was a German mathematician and philosopher who introduced the concept of vis viva, or living force, arguing that the true measure of the mechanical force of a system is the product of its mass and the square of its velocity (mv^2). This concept laid the groundwork for the understanding of kinetic energy. 2. Émilie du Châtelet (1706-1749): A French mathematician and physicist, du Châtelet recognized that the concept of vis viva also applied to the conservation of energy in a mechanical system. She translated Newton's Principia Mathematica and expanded on Leibniz's work, further establishing the connection between vis viva and energy conservation. 3. Julius Robert von Mayer (1814-1878): A German physician and physicist, Mayer proposed the idea that heat and mechanical work are interconvertible forms of energy. In 1842, he published a paper stating that \\"Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another.\\" This statement can be considered the first clear articulation of the law of conservation of energy. 4. James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894): Joule, a British physicist, and Helmholtz, a German physicist, conducted independent experiments and developed mathematical descriptions of the energy conservation principle. Joule demonstrated the mechanical equivalent of heat through his famous \\"Joule's apparatus\\" experiment, while Helmholtz's work focused on the broader concept of energy conservation in various physical systems. 5. William Thomson (1824-1907), later known as Lord Kelvin: A British physicist who helped unify the different concepts of energy conservation into a coherent theory. Thomson contributed significantly to establishing thermodynamics and its laws, including his formulation of the second law of thermodynamics. Considering these historical milestones and contributions, the law of conservation of energy was developed and refined over several centuries through the work of many individuals. It does not have a specific date of postulation but evolved through continuous research and progress in the scientific community. However, if one needs to credit a specific scientist for stating the principle, Julius Robert von Mayer's work in 1842 stating that \\"Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another\\" could be considered the first clear articulation of the law of conservation of energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are an average of 7,500 reported incidents a year, including 50 assaults involving weapons, a BBC Wales investigation shows. At the same time, prosecutions and other sanctions have reached their highest rate. There has been a Welsh Government drive to cut abuse, and it says the rise is due to more incidents being reported. Last year 300 incidents resulted in prosecution or other action. The Welsh Government said that improved safety measures are in place to protect staff and it is making progress. Data shows that much of the abuse is carried out by patients with mental health problems like dementia and is unintentional. The figures were obtained by BBC Wales using the Freedom of Information Act and show that the reported violence has remained fairly static over six years despite targeted measures to tackle the problem. However, it was down this year, from 8,343 last year to 7,558. More than 9,000 incidents in the past four years resulted in injury to staff and led to thousands of days of work lost. The most serious assaults included more than 80 sexual assaults of staff at hospitals across Wales. A further 50 involved weapons. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board even had figures showing that since 2007, 258 members of staff had suffered abuse - either verbal or physical - at the hands of their co-workers. They said that around 60 were reported each year with most relating to claims of verbal abuse or perceived disruptive behaviour. A spokesman said: \\"While occasional disagreements will inevitably occur between colleagues, especially working in an environment that at times can be pressured and stressful, the fact that the number of incidents that are reported formally is so low shows that most of these are resolved at a local level.\\" Neil Evans, 40, is an A&E nurse at Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital. He says violence and aggression is a fact of life for most staff. \\"We do have a zero tolerance policy and there is a lot of support at our hospital. \\"The police do intervene but it would be good to have more feedback on how these people are being dealt with and if they are being prosecuted.\\" He says he has been threatened and almost punched a few times and colleagues do experience regular threats from drunken patients. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) applauded the work being done but questioned why some health boards are still referring so few cases to the police. Tina Donnelly, director of the RCN in Wales, said: \\"It is pleasing to see an increase in the number of prosecutions and the number of reported cases has increased due to a zero tolerance policy. \\"Our anecdotal evidence is that nurses in Wales are delighted things are changing as four years ago eight out of 10 reported being a victim of violence,\\" she added. In 2009 a cross-party group of AMs said aggression against NHS workers in Wales had been tackled with a \\"lack of urgency\\". CCTV was installed at four hospital A&E departments and in five ambulances, while thousands of lone workers were given panic buttons. Last December then Health Minister Edwina Hart launched a new drive with the NHS, the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service. But Dr Charles Allanby, a Cardiff GP who was been a victim of violence and once foiled a knife-wielding patient in his surgery, said more needs to be done to tackle the root cause - alcohol. He told BBC Wales: \\"Attacks on doctors or nurses are indefensible. \\"One does have to accept it's something you come across and is sometimes the result of people having mental health problems. \\"In A&E departments there is a clear association with alcohol and it is directly to do with the longer licensing hours. \\"People should be lobbying their councillors and local MPs to see this problem tackled.\\" His view was shared by the Welsh Ambulance Service, which saw attacks rise to 257 in 2010. A spokesman said the causes of violence are \\"societal\\". \\"Incidents experienced by ambulance crews are often associated with excessive alcohol consumption by the assailants. \\"We uphold a zero tolerance policy against this form of abuse and do our utmost to report this behaviour to the police to pursue prosecution against offenders.\\" The Welsh Government said that when the programme started in 2008, prosecutions were in single figures. In 2010-11 there were 126 successful prosecutions with some leading to custodial sentences. In addition, there were 143 other sanctions, such as fixed penalties and anti-social behaviour orders. A spokesperson said: \\"Case management is a key component of the Welsh Government's approach to protecting staff against violence and aggression, while supporting those who have been affected by it. \\"There is still much to do, but the early indicators are that, working together, we are making progress. \\"Pressure to reduce the risks of violence and aggression towards NHS staff will continue.\\" Reassurance Encouraging staff to report incidents is a key priority, the spokesperson said. In future hospitals in Wales are to try to reduce the levels of crime in their A&E departments through the use of better design. Cwm Taf Health Board said: \\"Whilst no prosecutions have been made, there has been a noticeable rise in reassurance and a reduction in the fear of crime in all staff groups.\\" It said there have been 75 incidents in which the police were involved and in the period April 2010 to March 2011 there were 13 Asbo referrals while there are two incidents currently under investigation by the police. Powys, which does not have any A&E units, said most incidents were connected with patients with mental health issues or elderly patients. \\"It should be noted that the number of incidents has fallen considerably in the last year or so despite an increased awareness amongst staff in terms of reporting.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The text discusses the ongoing issue of violence and abuse against healthcare staff in Wales. Despite efforts to tackle the problem, the reported incidents have remained fairly constant over the past six years. In the last year, 300 incidents resulted in prosecution or other actions. The Welsh Government is focusing on improving safety measures for staff and encouraging the reporting of incidents. A large portion of the abuse comes from patients with mental health problems, and many incidents are linked to excessive alcohol consumption. The Royal College of Nursing appreciates the developments being made but believes more needs to be done to address the root causes, such as the influence of alcohol and societal issues. The Welsh Government emphasizes the importance of case management and support for affected staff members and aims to reduce crime levels in A&E departments through better design."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Famous Flames were an American rhythm and blues vocal group founded in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 by Bobby Byrd. James Brown began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first professional recording, \\"Please, Please, Please\\", in 1956. On hit songs such as \\"Try Me\\", \\"Bewildered\\", \\"Think\\", \\"I Don't Mind\\", and \\"I'll Go Crazy\\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned delivery, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, they performed on 12 songs that reached the Billboard R&B and pop charts, in addition to being featured on numerous albums, including the groundbreaking Live at the Apollo. James Brown began singing with the R&B group the Cremona Trio while growing up in Toccoa, Georgia. In 1949, Brown, then sixteen, was sent to a juvenile detention center after committing several offenses of armed robbery. While at the detention center, he formed a group called the Swanees, which included Johnny Terry. The band made their own instruments, including a comb and paper, a washtub bass and a drum kit made from lard tubs, while Brown himself played \\"a sort of mandolin [made] out of a wooden box.\\" This led to Brown's first nickname, \\"Music Box\\". In 1952, Brown's reform school baseball team played another team that featured Bobby Byrd and they soon became friends. Shortly after, Byrd and his family offered to be Brown's sponsors for an early prison release. Brown was paroled on June 14, 1952, on the condition he not return to his hometown. In response, Brown moved into Byrd's parents' home in Toccoa, finding work as a dishwasher and also trying short careers as a boxer and semi-professional baseball pitcher. Around this time, Byrd had formed the gospel vocal group, the Starlighters, which included Byrd's sister Sarah. Within a year, the group wanted to perform R&B but was afraid of being confronted by church leaders for \\"singing the Devil's music\\". This led the group to perform R&B under the name The Avons, which included members such as Troy Collins, Doyle Oglesby, Sylvester Keels and Willie Johnson. After deciding to focus primarily on R&B, they retired the Starlighters and performed in the South Carolina and Georgia areas as the Avons. In 1954, Brown again turned his attention to music with the group the Ever Ready Gospel Singers, which included his old reform school friend, Johnny Terry, who had been paroled at approximately the same time as Brown. However, when the group failed to get a recording deal they disbanded, leading Brown to return to Toccoa. Later in 1954, the Avons faced a tragedy when Troy Collins died in a car accident. Byrd asked Brown to replace Collins. At first, lead vocals were split between Byrd, Keels and Brown. Johnny Terry was also asked to join and he brought in a guitarist, Nafloyd Scott, and Fred Pulliam replaced Willie Johnson. It was around this time that the Avons changed their name to The Toccoa Band in order to avoid confusion with two other groups also named the Avons. Under their manager, Barry Tremier, the group began playing instruments, with Brown playing drums and Byrd the piano. How did the group first get together?","completion":"The group first got together in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 when Bobby Byrd founded the American rhythm and blues vocal group, The Famous Flames. James Brown joined the group after he was paroled from a juvenile detention center and became friends with Bobby Byrd. Brown moved into Byrd's parents' home and joined Byrd's gospel vocal group, the Starlighters, which later transitioned to perform R&B under the name The Avons. After a tragedy struck the Avons, Byrd asked Brown to replace a member who passed away in a car accident. They then reformed into The Toccoa Band, with additional members joining, under the management of Barry Tremier. The group's dynamic began to take shape, eventually giving rise to The Famous Flames as they gained prominence with James Brown as the lead singer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: uh-huh yeah oh um and how a five year old can grasp something like that is beyond is just a uh Sentence 2: I cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand that. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in linguistics refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence (the conclusion) is necessarily implied by the other (the premise). Meaning, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. Looking at the provided sentences: Sentence 1: \\"uh-huh yeah oh um and how a five year old can grasp something like that is beyond is just a uh\\" Sentence 2: \\"I cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand that.\\" Sentence 1 seems to suggest that there might be some difficulty in understanding how a five-year-old could grasp a particular concept, implied by the phrase \\"is beyond.\\" However, the sentence doesn't clearly state that the speaker cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand a given concept. Furthermore, the speaker's thought is unfinished, as evidenced by the trailing \\"uh,\\" so we don't know the full extent of their view. Sentence 2, on the other hand, explicitly says that the speaker cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand something. This is not necessarily implied within Sentence 1. While Sentence 1 suggests that there might be some difficulty in understanding how a five-year-old could comprehend a certain concept, it doesn't firmly convey that the speaker is incapable of understanding it. Hence, the first sentence doesn't necessarily mean the speaker can't understand how a five-year-old can understand a concept, so it doesn't entail the second sentence. The two sentences may be related or could be part of the same conversation, but they don't have a relationship of entailment."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

How is \\"I tried to swim back down to them, but... it was so dark.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In order to translate this sentence to Czech, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the key words and phrases in the English sentence. 2. Translate each key word or phrase into its Czech equivalent. 3. Rearrange the Czech words into the correct sentence order, considering Czech grammar rules. 4. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure the translated sentence flows smoothly and maintains the original meaning. The English sentence is: \\"I tried to swim back down to them, but... it was so dark.\\" Step 1: Identifying key words and phrases: - I tried: \\"I\\" is the subject and \\"tried\\" is the action. - to swim back down: This is the main action the subject is trying to do. - to them: This is the destination or target of the main action. - but: introduces an opposition or contradiction. - it was so dark: Describes a condition that complicates the main action. Step 2: Translate each key word or phrase into Czech: - I tried: Zkoušel jsem (for a male speaker), Zkoušela jsem (for a female speaker) - to swim back down: plavat zpět dolů - to them: k nim - but: ale - it was so dark: Bylo to tak tmavé Step 3: Rearrange the Czech words into the correct sentence order: - Zkoušel jsem plavat zpět dolů k nim, ale... Bylo to tak tmavé (for a male speaker) - Zkoušela jsem plavat zpět dolů k nim, ale... Bylo to tak tmavé (for a female speaker) Thus, the translated sentence in Czech is: \\"Zkoušel jsem plavat zpět dolů k nim, ale... Bylo to tak tmavé\\" for a male speaker, and \\"Zkoušela jsem plavat zpět dolů k nim, ale... Bylo to tak tmavé\\" for a female speaker."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"Two types of misstatements are relevant to the auditors' consideration of fraud in an audit of financial statements- misstatements arising from fraudulent financial statements and misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Misstatements can never arise from misappropriation of assets.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Misstatements can never arise from misappropriation of assets.\\" is true. In fact, the premise contradicts the hypothesis, as it states that there are two types of misstatements relevant to auditors' consideration of fraud in an audit of financial statements, and one of those types is misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets. This indicates that misstatements can, in fact, arise from the misappropriation of assets. Misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting involve intentional manipulation of financial statements to depict a company's financial position, performance, or cash flows more favorably than they really are. This may include practices such as inflating revenues, suppressing expenses, or overstating assets. The primary motivation behind fraudulent financial reporting is to deceive financial statement users, typically the investors and creditors, into believing that the company is performing better than it actually is. On the other hand, misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets involve the theft or misuse of an entity's assets for personal gain or for the benefit of others. For example, this could include embezzlement of cash, fraudulent billing schemes, or inventory theft. When assets are misappropriated, it results in a misstatement of the financial statements, as the missing or misused assets are not accurately reflected in the financial statement balances. The motivation behind misappropriation of assets is typically to either benefit the person committing the fraud or deceive others into believing a false representation of the company's financial situation. By acknowledging the existence of misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets, the given premise directly refutes the hypothesis that misstatements can never arise from misappropriation of assets. Auditors should be aware of both types of misstatements when conducting an audit, as detecting and addressing these potential fraud risks is a crucial part of ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial statements. In summary, the given premise states that misstatements arise from both fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets, indicating that it is not true that misstatements can never arise from misappropriation of assets. The hypothesis is contradicted by the premise, as misappropriation of assets is presented as one of the sources of misstatements that auditors need to consider during financial statement audits."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it is difficult to definitively say which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and with a hot engine - the car or the truck. The antifreeze that Rob added to the car radiator could potentially help regulate the temperature in the car's engine and prevent it from overheating. On the other hand, without additional information on the truck's cooling system, we cannot conclude that it would fare worse than the car. Antifreeze is a coolant that not only helps to prevent the engine from freezing in cold temperatures but also aids in heat transfer, preventing the engine from overheating in hot weather. Consequently, having antifreeze in the radiator would generally improve a vehicle's performance in hot weather conditions. However, there are additional factors that come into play when considering a vehicle's sensitivity to hot weather, such as the efficiency of the cooling system, and other mechanical conditions. The lack of antifreeze in the truck's radiator does potentially increase the risk of overheating in hot weather, but determining which vehicle would fare worse requires more information on the condition, make, and model of both the car and the truck's engines and cooling systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: when does a week start sunday or monday??","completion":"The start of a week can be either Sunday or Monday, and the choice varies depending upon regions, countries, cultures, and individual preferences. Let's explore these differences in detail. 1. Sunday as the start of the week: In many countries, particularly in the Americas, Sunday is considered the first day of the week. This practice has its roots in religious beliefs, as Sunday is often observed as the \\"Sabbath\\" or \\"Lord's Day\\" in Christianity, marking the day Jesus Christ resurrected after the crucifixion. The United States, Canada, Brazil, and Japan are some examples of countries where Sunday is commonly considered the beginning of the week. The most widely used calendar system, the Gregorian calendar, also designates Sunday as the first day of the week. This is evident in various calendar systems and software applications, as well as when examining international standards such as the ISO week date system. However, this standard does not dictate which day should be officially recognized as the first day of the week. 2. Monday as the start of the week: Many countries and cultures, especially in Europe and Asia, adopt Monday as the first day of the week. This can be attributed to multiple factors, such as the influence of the workweek, secularization, and cultural evolution. In many European languages, Monday is named after the Moon, which is often perceived to indicate the beginning of a new cycle. Countries like the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia, China, and India are some examples where Monday is recognized as the start of the week. International Organization for Standardization's ISO 8601 standard specifies Monday as the first day of the week. This is a widely recognized standard that promotes consistency in international trade, communication, and data processing. It is used by specialized organizations, institutions, and industries working across different countries, cultures, or languages to ensure a consistent understanding of dates and weeks. In conclusion, whether a week starts on Sunday or Monday depends on the regional, cultural, or individual preferences. Some countries and regions consider Sunday as the first day, while others adopt Monday as the start of the week. It is essential to understand and respect the diversity of these practices when interacting with people from different parts of the world or when interpreting international calendar standards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - \`\` Relentless '' is a song written by James LeBlanc and John Paul White and recorded by American country music artist Jason Aldean . It was released in May 2008 as the third and final single from his 2007 album of the same name . The song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in late 2008 . - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. - Broken Bow Records is an American independent record label based in Nashville, Tennessee.

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What term are comic books known for in terms of humorous or non-humorous?\\" Context: \\"The English term comics derives from the humorous (or \\"comic\\") work which predominated in early American newspaper comic strips; usage of the term has become standard for non-humorous works as well. The term \\"comic book\\" has a similarly confusing history: they are most often not humorous; nor are they regular books, but rather periodicals. It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as manga for Japanese comics, or bandes dessinées for French-language Franco-Belgian comics.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Comic books are known for both humorous and non-humorous content, as the term \\"comics\\" originated from early American newspaper comic strips which were predominantly humorous. Despite this origin, the usage of the term has expanded to include non-humorous works as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots (based on the colors of the Flag of Lithuania with bullet holes in it). Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen. Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\". Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen. But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside. Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint. When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground. Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, until he accidentally throws some of the flowers on Donald, revealing his outline. Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again. However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald. When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after he asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\" The invisible Donald then puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making him scream in pain and jump around like a madman, making the General wonder what is going on with Pete.
