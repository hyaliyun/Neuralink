Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Eastleigh is in Hampshire, England, and the main town in the Borough of Eastleigh. The town lies between Southampton and Winchester, and is part of the South Hampshire conurbation. The first substantial growth was as a railway town. Now it is home to many businesses, including a manufacturing plant owned by Prysmian Cables & Systems (formerly the cables division of Pirelli). The town lies on the River Itchen, one of England's premier chalk streams for fly fishing, a designated site of Special Scientific Interest. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - Collage (from the , \\"to glue\\") is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the visual arts, where the artwork is made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Portsea Island is a small, flat and low-lying island just off the south coast of England. The island is totally within, and contains a large proportion of, the city of Portsmouth. The third largest by population of any island in the British Isles after the mainlands of Great Britain and Ireland, it has the highest population density. - Population density (in agriculture: standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, and most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term. - Havant is a town in the south east corner of Hampshire, England approximately midway between Portsmouth and Chichester. Its borough (population: 125,000) comprises the town and its suburbs including the resort of Hayling Island as well as Rowland's Castle (an exurb), the smaller town of Waterlooville and Langstone Harbour.

The southern boundary is the coastline of the English Channel and the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Fareham is a market town at the north-west tip of Portsmouth Harbour, between the cities of Portsmouth and Southampton in the south east of Hampshire, England.

Plot title: Longford Movie plot: From HBO.com:LONGFORD [Jim Broadbent] is a thought-provoking story inspired by real events in the life of British Lord Frank Pakenham, the 7th Earl of Longford, and his controversial headline-making friendship with one of England's most notorious criminals. Longford, a devout Catholic, often visited prisoners because of his passionate belief in forgiveness and society's need for prisoner rehabilitation.In 1965, he begins visiting Myra Hindley [Samantha Morton], a young woman serving a life sentence for murdering children with her lover Ian Brady [Andy Serkis]. Though Longford encountered public outrage, discouragement from his wife Elizabeth [Lindsay Duncan], doubt from his family, and criticism from his colleagues and the press, he continued to visit and exchange letters with Hindley. After learning that she once converted to Catholicism, Longford encourages her to return to the church and ask for God's forgiveness.After the Prime Minister removes him from the House of Lords, he devotes his time to crusading for Hindley and other prisoners. His wife eventually joins the crusade after reading Hindley's letters, meeting her and seeing the horrible prison conditions. She suspects that Hindley is receiving harsher punishment because she is a woman. Longford takes Hindley's cause public, talking to the press about her case and defending her as an accomplice corrupted by Ian Brady.At first, Hindley is grateful for Longford's efforts and seems to make progress in her return to the church. Later, she unexpectedly rejects his help and shocks him with the news that she lied to him about the murders. Once this information is made public, Longford's good name is damaged even further. Longford begins to question his religious beliefs, but reaches a deeper level in his Catholic faith when he is able to forgive Hindley for her transgressions against him.Many years later, she asks him to visit her once again and he complies.

Analyze the given sentences: The first sentence provided is \\"Two children wearing white capes are running through a cleared out path in a field.\\" This gives us direct evidence about the activities of the children, their attire, and the location. The second sentence is the statement we need to test for truth; it is \\"Children are playing super heroes outside.\\" 2. Break down the components of the second sentence: \\"Children\\" corresponds to \\"Two children\\" in the original sentence. \\"are playing super heroes\\" indicates imaginative play and possibly the wearing of costumes. There is no direct indication in the first sentence that the children are pretending to be super heroes, only that they are wearing capes, which is often associated with such pretend play. \\"outside\\" corresponds well with \\"running through a cleared out path in a field\\" in the original sentence as both indicate an outdoor setting. 3. Evaluate the sentence as a whole: Based on the points above, we can see that the children are indeed outside, and they are wearing capes and running, which could reasonably be interpreted as an indication that they are playing at being super heroes, even though it's not explicitly stated. 4.

ACTION2: Not correcting a guest's mispronounced words at work - This action could be considered as avoiding potential embarrassment for the guest or maintaining a polite and respectful conversation. However, if the person continues to mispronounce important words or concepts consistently, and not correcting them may lead to miscommunication or misunderstandings, it could be considered unethical not to correct them professionally. Comparison: Charging high amounts for snacks could be viewed as unethical if the intention is to exploit or take advantage of customers. On the other hand, not correcting a guest's mispronounced words may not be unethical if the intention is to maintain a respectful conversation and avoid embarrassing the guest. It can only be identified as unethical if it leads to significant communication issues.

A. ceiling B. library C. surface of earth D. most buildings E. desktop The best answer is Answer:","completion":"D. most buildings Dust accumulation is a common occurrence in most buildings. This is the best answer because it covers a broad range of areas where dust can accumulate. Dust, which is composed of various particles, including dead skin cells, hair, fibers, pollen, and other materials, can gather on many surfaces within a building. Factors such as human activity, indoor air quality, and the effectiveness of ventilation systems can all contribute to dust build-up. While other options, such as the ceiling (A), the library (B), the surface of the earth (C), and the desktop (E), are also places where dust can accumulate, these options are more specific and narrow in scope. Ceilings (A) can indeed collect dust, particularly in the corners or on light fixtures, but this is just one area within a building where dust can settle. Libraries (B) are also notorious for dust accumulation due to the vast number of books on shelves, which can trap and hold dust particles. However, this is still just one type of building where dust is found. The surface of the earth (C) might seem like an all-encompassing answer, but it is not as accurate as most buildings (D). The earth's surface includes various natural and urban landscapes, such as forests, deserts, oceans, and cities. While dust is present everywhere on earth, the distribution and concentration of dust differ depending on these locations. Thus, it does not emphasize the specific nature of dust accumulation in built environments. Lastly, desktops (E) are one of the many surfaces within a building where dust can collect, but it is too specific and does not include all the other areas in a building where dust might be found, such as floors, walls, shelves, and more.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The wide variety of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has been found to be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 discovered the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).Fish are plentiful in the waters surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island. The sandbar of Carabane has very few mammals other than pets, although the French first noted the presence of monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island.

A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own \\"little Foreign Office ... the hub of resistance\\". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, \\"I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament\\". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, \\"there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late\\".Churchill also recorded visits to Chartwell by two more of his most important suppliers of confidential governmental information, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, information which he used to \\"form and fortify my opinion about the Hitler Movement\\". Chartwell was also the scene of more direct attempts to prepare Britain for the coming conflict; in October 1939, when reappointed First Lord of the Admiralty on the outbreak of war, Churchill suggested an improvement for anti-aircraft shells; \\"Such shells could be filled with zinc ethyl which catches fire spontaneously ...

Drink approximately four 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of apple juice or apple cider each day for a period of five days. For best results, drink the apple juice at room temperature or slightly warmed.","completion":"The most logical next event for this gallstone removal home remedy would be to perform a gallbladder flush on the sixth day to enable the passing of gallstones. It is important to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the remedy, and consult a healthcare professional before embarking on this process, as it may not be suitable for everyone. Here are the steps for the gallbladder flush: 1. Preparation: Before starting the flush on the sixth day, it is essential to eat a light breakfast and lunch. Avoid consuming any fat or oil-based food, as they may hinder the cleansing process. 2. Epsom Salt Solution: In the afternoon, around 6 pm, mix 4 tablespoons of Epsom salt in 24 ounces (710 ml) of water. This will make four servings. Set aside this solution for later use. Epsom salt acts as a laxative, which will help in passing the gallstones more efficiently. 3. First Epsom Salt Dose: Drink the first 6-ounce (180 ml) serving of the Epsom salt solution at 6 pm. Consume it slowly, and try to relax, as this will allow your body to prepare for the flush effectively. 4. Second Epsom Salt Dose: At 8 pm, drink the second serving of the Epsom salt solution. It is essential to stay relaxed during this time, refrain from performing any physically demanding tasks, and focus on preparing your body for the flush. 5. Olive Oil and Citrus Juice: At 10 pm, mix 1/2 cup (118 ml) of extra virgin olive oil with 3/4 cup (177 ml) of freshly squeezed grapefruit or lemon juice. Shake the mixture well until it becomes a watery consistency. 6. Lying Down: Consume the olive oil and citrus juice mix while standing up. Immediately after drinking the mixture, lie down on your right side on the bed with your knees drawn up to your chest. This position is essential, as it helps the oil mix to reach the gallbladder quickly. 7. Sleep: Try to fall asleep and stay asleep for several hours. The gallstones will soften during this time and may pass through the gallbladder more easily. 8. Remaining Epsom Salt Doses: The next day, upon waking up, drink the third Epsom salt solution serving. Relax and wait for any bowel movements. Two hours later, consume the final serving of the Epsom salt solution. Throughout the day, you may experience multiple bowel movements during which the softened gallstones will pass. These may appear as small, greenish pellets in the toilet. After the gallbladder flush, it is crucial to follow a healthy and balanced diet to maintain optimal gallbladder health. Include foods that are rich in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and minimize the consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol-containing foods. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and staying hydrated can support gallbladder health. However, it is highly recommended to consult a healthcare professional before attempting any home remedy, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are on any medications, as this process may not be suitable or safe for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

BUCHAREST, Romania — Huge protests, some of the largest since the fall of communism, toppled the government of Romania on Wednesday, five days after a fire at a nightclub killed 32 people and set off a wave of outrage over corruption and ineptitude. Prime Minister Victor Ponta — who was already under pressure, having been indicted this year on charges of forgery, money laundering and tax evasion — said he was bowing to the will of the more than 20,000 demonstrators who had taken to the streets of Bucharest on Tuesday night to demand his ouster. “I have the obligation to acknowledge that there is legitimate anger in society,” Mr. Ponta, 43, said in a statement. “In my years as a politician, I put up a fight in any battle with political opponents. However, I won’t put up a fight against the people.” It was a startling and sudden fall from power for Mr. Ponta, who became prime minister in May 2012, and it was reminiscent of the uprising that overthrew the government of Ukraine last year. It was also a vivid reminder of Romania’s awkward fit in the European Union, which it joined, with Bulgaria, in 2007 despite concerns about corruption and the rule of law. ||||| This article is over 2 years old In aftermath of 32 deaths, president endorses demonstrations targeting Victor Ponta – who has stayed in office despite facing trial for corruption Anger over Bucharest nightclub fire spirals into demands for PM to resign More than 20,000 people have rallied in Bucharest demanding Romania’s prime minister resign after a deadly nightclub fire that claimed 32 lives. Demonstrators gathered in Bucharest’s Victory Square, the seat of government, calling for Victor Ponta’s resignation and that of his interior minister, Gabriel Oprea. Police arrest owners of Bucharest fire tragedy nightclub Read more Ponta, 43, had already been under growing pressure to quit after he went on trial in September facing charges of fraud, tax evasion and money laundering. The Social Democrat is the first Romanian head of government to stand trial while still in office. The charges date back to 2007-2011, when Ponta was working as a lawyer. He became prime minister in 2012. Marchers on Tuesday chanted “Ponta resign” and “killers”, and some waved the national flag with holes in it: a symbol of the popular revolution 25 years ago that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. President Klaus Iohannis, who had earlier paid tribute to two heroes in the blaze and demanded reforms to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy, praised the rally. “I am impressed by this evening’s demonstrations,” the conservative head of state said on his Facebook page. The country’s political leaders, he said, “cannot ignore this feeling of revolt.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Emergency service staff work outside the Colectiv nightclub in Bucharest where 32 people died after an explosion Viorel Anastasoaie, a demonstrator aged in his thirties, said the rally was “a gesture of solidarity” with the victims of the blaze “and a sign of protest against the government, against the district mayor, against the system which enabled a tragedy of this kind to happen”. Earlier mourners paid tribute to two men who sacrificed themselves in the fire which engulfed the basement club in a Communist-era building on Friday. The toll of 32 dead and nearly 200 injured would have been deadlier had Claudiu Petre, a physicist by training, and drummer Adrian Rugina not been at the Colectiv disco when an illegal pyrotechnics display went horribly awry. The pair went several times into the burning club to rescue trapped revellers, only to die themselves. Witnesses said a fireworks display triggered the blaze at the Colectiv, which was located in a former shoe factory. The inferno sparked a deadly stampede.

The accusations sparked a backlash against the ecclesiastical authorities, especially against Patriarch Daniel, head of the Romanian Orthodox church, who has maintained a studied silence on the tragedy. On Monday Petre and Rugina were posthumously decorated by Iohannis for “their courage and altruism and for saving lives at the cost of supreme sacrifice”. “Their time is not over as heroes never die,” Iohannis said. In remarks on Sunday, Iohannis also called for society to face up to the need for root-and-branch reform. “We should no longer tolerate government incompetence, institutional inefficiency, and we cannot let corruption spread to the point that it kills people,” he said. ||||| BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta announced the resignation of his government Wednesday following huge protests in the wake of a nightclub fire that killed more than 30 people.

If this fails twice, early elections will be called. Romania is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in December 2016. The mayor of the district in the Romanian capital where the nightclub is located, Cristian Popescu Piedone, also resigned Wednesday, saying he is morally guilty for the deadliest fire in Romania's history. Piedone said: \\"I assume the moral blame. As for the legal (blame) I will leave it to justice to pronounce.\\" He came under pressure to step down following mass protests through the city Tuesday night, with more than 20,000 demonstrators blaming widespread corruption for the deadly blaze on Friday night. Witnesses said the fire broke out during a heavy-metal concert in the basement club when a spark ignited foam decor, sending panicked people stampeding for the single exit. The death toll stands at 32, with some 130 still hospitalized, dozens of them in serious or critical condition. Deputy leader of the opposition Liberal Party, Catalin Predoiu, hailed the resignations. \\"This is a victory of the street. It is a lesson for all politicians,\\" he said. Thousands took to the streets the night before in a spontaneous protest calling for the resignation of Ponta, Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea and Piedone. They shouted \\"Shame on you!\\" and \\"Assassins!\\" and waved Romanian flags. Anger has been brewing for some time in Romania against the government, which many perceive as being corrupt, and Friday's fire has added to the discontent. Even before the fire, Ponta had been under pressure from his oponents to resign, but had refused. He is on trial for corruption charges including tax evasion, money laundering, conflict of interest and making false statements while he was working as a lawyer in 2007 and 2008. At the time, Ponta was a lawmaker. He denies wrongdoing. Romanians had also called for the resignation of Oprea over the on-duty death of a police motorcyclist, who died after he hit a hole on Oct. 20.

U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made.

Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said.

You'll need to overcome a few factors on your way to becoming a train operator, but the biggest obstacle in your path is a union agreement made in 2008. According to this agreement, the tfl is not allowed to advertise externally and, instead, hires mostly from within the organization.","completion":"To become a tube driver, you must first understand the challenges you will face, including the 2008 union agreement that makes it difficult for external candidates to be hired. However, with determination and the right strategy, you can increase your chances of being recruited and becoming a successful train operator. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to become a tube driver: 1. Research the role and qualifications: Gaining as much knowledge about the position and its requirements is essential. Tube drivers are responsible for operating trains on time while ensuring the safety and comfort of their passengers. Ideally, you should have clear communication skills, calmness under pressure, resilience, and problem-solving abilities. 2. Gain relevant experience: Since TfL primarily hires from within the organization, your best chance of becoming a tube driver is by obtaining a job in the company to secure an internal advantage. Positions such as station staff, customer service assistants, or other roles within the transportation industry can offer valuable experience and aid in building relevant skills. 3. Obtain necessary qualifications: While there are no specific educational requirements for tube drivers, having good levels of English and Mathematics will be beneficial. In addition, obtaining qualifications in railway operations, customer service, or safety-related fields can make you a more desirable candidate. 4. Network and join a union: Building connections and relationships with current employees, especially those in the train operation sector, can boost your chances of getting inside information about upcoming positions and opportunities. Joining a union can also provide access to resources and support throughout the recruitment process. 5. Stay updated on job openings: Regularly check the TfL website and other job portals for vacancies or opportunities related to tube drivers. Internal candidates are often given priority, so being a TfL employee will provide a significant advantage. 6. Apply for the train operator trainee program: As a TfL employee, you can apply for the train operator trainee program when it becomes available. The program typically involves a series of tests, interviews, and background checks. It may also include extensive training that covers theoretical and practical aspects of train operation, safety regulations, and emergency procedures. 7. Gain necessary licenses: Upon successful completion of the training program, you will need to obtain the necessary licenses and certifications required to become a professional tube driver. This might include passing specific safety assessments or completing on-the-job training supervised by a qualified instructor. 8. Pursue continuous professional development: Learning should not stop once you become a tube driver. Participate in ongoing training programs to stay up-to-date on the latest safety protocols, technological advancements, and industry best practices. 9. Explore career advancement opportunities: Becoming a tube driver can also open doors to other career opportunities within TfL, such as becoming an instructor, supervisor, or manager in train operations. Seek ways to grow within the organization and continue to strengthen your skills. In conclusion, the process of becoming a tube driver may be challenging due to the existing union agreement and the highly competitive nature of the role. However, by gaining relevant experience, continuously improving your skills, and remaining persistent, you can ultimately achieve your goal of becoming a train operator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment. In which case the Bt toxin is in an active state, case A or case B? Hint: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.

The adversaries we examine are universal in three ways: (1) They are not specific for specific object instances; (2) They are image-independent; (3) They can further transfer to different unknown models. To achieve this, we propose two novel techniques to improve the transferability of the adversaries: textit{piling-up} and textit{monochromatization}.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Princess Louise-Hippolyte succeeded? ? Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien.

Question: what is an agents job role in film? Would \\"Actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity and so were able to work on within their time and with other studios.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"An agent's job role in the film industry is primarily to represent and negotiate on behalf of their clients, who may include actors, actresses, directors, screenwriters, and other professionals in the entertainment field. They work to secure job opportunities, negotiate contracts, and promote their clients' careers. The agent acts as a liaison between their clients and production companies, networks, or studios. Regarding the statement \\"Actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity and so were able to work on within their time and with other studios,\\" this can be considered a reasonable answer depending on the context. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, actors and actresses were often contracted to specific studios and rarely, if ever, worked with other studios. However, as time progressed, the studio system changed, and contracts became less restrictive, actors and actresses gained more freedom to work with various studios and projects. This evolution in the industry allowed agents to play a crucial role in advocating for their clients and securing diverse work opportunities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It rarely worked anyway. \\"You don't really want to take piano, do you?\\" \\"No, Sir.\\" \\"Well... \\" \\"I wish my mom would let me take guitar lessons. That would be cool.\\" \\"You know you'd get calluses like this.\\" Greg held out left hand and showed Jeffrey his fingertips. \\"Yeah! My friend, Zach, has calluses.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which is this about? It is two days before payday and you are almost out of gas. To pay for it, you write a check. You hope it takes two or three days before it hits your bank, and by then, your paycheck will be deposited.","completion":"This situation is about strategically utilizing the lag time (also known as the float time) it takes for a check to clear through the banking system, in order to avoid overdraft fees or insufficient funds in the account. In this scenario, you find yourself with an almost empty gas tank just two days before your paycheck is due to be deposited into your bank account. To manage this situation without incurring extra fees or penalties, you decide to write a check for the gas you need, even though you don't have enough funds in your account to cover the expense at this very moment. By writing the check, you are essentially betting that it will take at least two or three days for the gas station to deposit the check into their account and for the banking system to process it, moving the funds from your account to theirs. This time lag between the moment you write the check and the moment when the funds are withdrawn from your account is called the check float time. From your point of view, the primary purpose of relying on check float time in this case is to buy yourself some time until your paycheck is deposited into your account. Ideally, by the time the check written for the gas is processed, your account will be replenished with your paycheck funds, effectively covering the check amount and preventing any overdraft fees or negative account balances. However, there are a few important considerations and potential risks associated with this practice: 1. Unpredictable float time: The float time can vary greatly from one financial institution to another and can be affected by factors such as weekends, holidays, and bank processing policies. The check may clear more quickly than you anticipate, and if the paycheck is not deposited in time, you could face overdraft fees or other penalties. 2. Bad check consequences: Writing checks without sufficient funds in your account is also known as \\"kiting\\" or \\"floating\\" checks. Depending on the jurisdiction, it can be considered illegal and lead to financial penalties or even criminal charges in severe cases. 3. Impact on credit score: Habitual reliance on check float time and overdrawing your account can negatively impact your credit score. A low credit score can make it more difficult to get credit cards, loans, and can even affect your job prospects. 4. Evolving technology: With the advent of electronic check processing systems and near-instantaneous transfers, float times have considerably reduced compared to the past. This makes it riskier to rely on check float time as a financial strategy. In summary, this situation is about attempting to strategically use check float time as a temporary solution to a cash flow issue, specifically the predicament of needing gas when your account balance is low, just before a paycheck is deposited. While doing so could work in some cases, it is important to consider the potential consequences and risks associated with such a practice. A better approach would be to maintain a budget or emergency fund to cover unexpected or short-term expenses like this."},{"prompt":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person Stern compared to Marilyn?, using the article: Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not \\"paid her dues\\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \\"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\\"In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome \\"girl next door\\" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. Her \\"Spinning Around\\" video led to some media outlets referring to her as \\"SexKylie\\", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos.

For the best results, choose a white or light colored nylon suit. Use garbage bags, old towels, or an old tablecloth to protect surfaces. Work outside if possible. Acid dye will give you the best results. Choose one color for a monochrome design, or multiple colors for a more traditional tie dye look. Use rubber gloves to protect your skin while preparing the dye and while dyeing your swimsuit. Pull up small pieces of the fabric about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart and tie the material off with your rubber bands. Create interesting patterns by varying the amount of fabric you tie off and/or the spacing between each section. The longer you leave the suit in place, the darker the color will be. Rotate to a new section and a new color until the whole suit is covered with dye. Dyeing time can be anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes depending on the base color of the suit and how dark of a shade you want. When using multiple colors, expect some of the colors to run together at the edges and create a new color. This will add more interest and color to your suit and is preferable to leaving areas without dye coverage. If you are using only one color, you can use a large dye bath and fully submerge the suit once you've tied it off with rubber bands. When the water runs clear, wrap the suit in an old towel to remove any excess water and dye. Hang to dry. Place an old towel underneath the suit as it drys to catch any excess dye. The first few times the suit is washed, wash it alone in case it bleeds.

Egg drop soup is a common Chinese dish.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that egg drop soup is a common Chinese dish. It is a simple and comforting soup made with beaten eggs and other ingredients such as chicken broth or water, cornstarch, and sometimes seasonings like soy sauce, scallions, and sesame oil. Instant ramen noodles can be added for an even more filling and satisfying meal. To make simple egg drop soup with instant ramen noodles, you will need the following ingredients: - 1 pack of instant ramen noodles - 1 to 2 eggs (depending on your preference) - 4 cups of water or chicken broth - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce (optional) - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch (optional, for a thicker soup) - 1 scallion, sliced (optional) - Sesame oil (optional, for drizzling on top) Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to create this flavorful dish: 1. Fill a pot with 4 cups of water or chicken broth. This should be a little over halfway in a medium-sized pot. Place the pot on the stove, set the heat to high and bring the liquid to a rolling boil. 2. Once the water or broth is boiling, add the instant ramen noodles to the pot. Follow the cooking instructions on the ramen package to cook the noodles. If you desire a richer soup, you can also add the seasoning packet provided with the instant ramen noodles. 3. In a small bowl, beat the eggs and set them aside. 4. (Optional) In another small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a little bit of water to create a slurry. This will help to thicken the soup. You may skip this step if you prefer a thinner soup. 5. When the noodles are cooked, reduce the heat to a simmer and slowly pour the beaten eggs into the pot while stirring the soup in a swirling motion. This will create the signature egg ribbons in the soup. Make sure to pour the eggs slowly and steadily to achieve the desired consistency. 6. (Optional) If you have prepared the cornstarch slurry, stir it into the soup at this point. Allow the soup to simmer for another two minutes to further thicken it. 7. Remove the pot from the heat and taste the soup. If needed, add soy sauce for additional flavor. 8. Ladle the soup into bowls, making sure each serving has noodles and egg. 9. (Optional) For added flavor and visual appeal, garnish the soup with sliced scallions and a drizzle of sesame oil.

He revealed his identity for the first time in 2005. Bernstein never met Felt until this year, but praised his courage during an interview Friday on CNN's \\"American Morning.\\" Look, OPTIONS: - All the President's Men was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - American Morning was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Bernstein was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Bob Woodward was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - CNN was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - California was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Carl Bernstein was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Deep Throat was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - FBI was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Felt was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Mark Felt was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Richard Nixon was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - W. Mark Felt was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Washington Post was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Watergate was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Watergate scandal was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Woodward was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency.","completion":"Look, the Watergate scandal was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. It brought to light unprecedented political corruption and abuse of power within the highest levels of the United States government. As investigative journalists, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward were determined to uncover the truth, navigating a maze of deceit, conspiracy, and cover-ups. Their determination would eventually transform American politics and journalism. W. Mark Felt, a high-ranking FBI official and the secret informant known as \\"Deep Throat,\\" was instrumental in helping Woodward and Bernstein connect the dots. His insider knowledge of the inner workings of the Nixon administration and the FBI enabled the reporters to trace the Watergate break-in back to the White House and reveal the extensive efforts made to cover it up. The moniker \\"Deep Throat\\" was a reference to the anonymous nature of Felt's revelations, which he shared with the journalists through a series of clandestine meetings. This cautious approach was necessary in an environment where the government went to great lengths to discredit and intimidate anyone who dared to challenge its authority. The Watergate scandal reached its peak when it became apparent that President Richard Nixon had actively participated in the conspiracy to obstruct justice. Faced with the prospect of impeachment, he chose to resign in disgrace, leaving the nation grappling with the aftermath of a president betraying the trust of the American people. As a consequence, public faith in government institutions was shaken to its core, leading to an era of skepticism and calls for greater transparency. \\"All the President's Men,\\" the book written by Woodward and Bernstein that chronicled their investigation into the Watergate scandal, served as both an exposé and a tribute to the dogged pursuit of truth in journalism. By recounting the story of Deep Throat and their relentless effort to uncover the facts, the authors showed that the free press is a powerful safeguard against corruption in a democratic society. This seminal work continues to inspire generations of journalists to seek the truth and hold those in power accountable, no matter how high the stakes may be. In the end, the Watergate scandal taught America a painful lesson about the importance of upholding the fundamental principles of the Constitution, such as checks and balances and the rule of law. The crisis was a reminder that democratic institutions can only function effectively if every citizen is committed to maintaining their integrity. In this regard, the courage of individuals like W. Mark Felt, Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward, and many others who played a role in shining a light on the truth remains a lasting testament to the resilience of democracy itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","completion":"The famous book that Benjamin Franklin wrote is called \\"Poor Richard's Almanack.\\" While not a traditional book in the narrative sense, it was a yearly almanac published by Benjamin Franklin from 1732 to 1758, featuring a variety of content including weather forecasts, proverbs, poems, and practical advice. It is one of Franklin's most well-known accomplishments in the realm of literature and communication. Benjamin Franklin wrote \\"Poor Richard's Almanack\\" under the pseudonym \\"Richard Saunders.\\" At the time, a multitude of almanacs were available, and Franklin's written work needed to be unique to stand out and succeed. Franklin not only provided traditional almanac content but infused his own wit, insights, and humorous aphorisms that have stood the test of time. Many of these sayings have become famous and commonly used expressions, such as \\"A penny saved is a penny earned,\\" \\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\\" and \\"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\\" \\"Poor Richard's Almanack\\" was a significant source of income and success for Benjamin Franklin during its publication run. It sold around 10,000 copies every year, helping Franklin to develop his reputation as a clever writer and printing business owner. The almanac also served as a platform for Franklin to share his political and scientific ideas, using the popular publication to gain a wider audience for his thoughts. One of the most famous excerpts from \\"Poor Richard's Almanack\\" is \\"The Way to Wealth,\\" a collection of advice and wisdom on achieving success in life.

Write a title for this article: NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (AP) -- U.S. Rep. William Jefferson easily defeated his fellow Democratic opponent in a runoff election Saturday, despite an ongoing federal bribery investigation. In complete but unofficial returns, Jefferson, Louisiana's first black congressman since Reconstruction, received 57 percent of the vote over state Rep. Karen Carter, who had 43 percent. Carter was unable to capitalize on a scandal that included allegations the FBI found 90,000 in bribe money in Jefferson's freezer. In a concession speech, Carter embraced family members and pledged to work with Jefferson, especially on the area's recovery from Hurricane Katrina. \\"I guess the people are happy with the status-quo,\\" she said. Jefferson was forced into the runoff against Carter when he failed to win 50 percent of the vote in a crowded open multiparty primary. Carter had sought to become the first black woman from Louisiana elected to Congress. He described his win as \\"a great moment, and I thank almighty God for making it possible.\\" He called for regional unity to focus on the hurricane recovery and in bringing back evacuees who are still scattered across the country. His presence in Washington could be embarrassing for Democrats, who won control of Congress on a platform of cleaning up corruption. In June, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, led a successful effort to remove Jefferson from the powerful House Ways and Means Committee as the probe unfolded. He was accused of taking bribes from a company seeking lucrative contracts in the Nigerian telecommunications market. He has not been charged with any crime and denies any wrongdoing. The scandal turned the race into a debate largely divided along racial lines, an age-old dynamic in this city that has intensified since Hurricane Katrina displaced large numbers of blacks and upended their demographic and political dominance. Whites, who overwhelmingly voted for Carter in the primary and have been her most enthusiastic financial backers, believed a Jefferson win would confirm this city's image as corrupt and untrustworthy as it asks the nation to fund its recovery from Katrina. City Councilman Oliver Thomas said Jefferson's success would make the recovery more difficult. \\"People are watching this election all around the country, and I can only imagine what they are thinking,\\" Thomas said. \\"It will be very difficult to go back to them and ask them to trust us with the money we need here.\\" Carter's campaign spokesman and father, Ken Carter, said he felt they had done all they could to compete against Jefferson, but regretted the tone of the campaign in the final stages. \\"Race is all too often a factor in campaigns in New Orleans,\\" Ken Carter said. \\"Here we had a candidate that tried to paint this young African-American woman as a pawn of the white establishment.\\" One white voter, George Christen, a registered independent, cast his ballot in a predominantly white precinct in the Algiers neighborhood, just across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter. \\"I just didn't want Jefferson in. Period,\\" said Christen, 42. \\"Jefferson is an embarrassment. He needs to be out.\\" Jefferson did get a vote from Jene Allen, who is black. \\"He started the job. Let him finish it,\\" said Allen, who wouldn't give her age. \\"I know Karen Carter would be the first black woman, but I think she played it dirty, too dirty.\\" Jefferson drew widespread support among blacks who are skeptical of the federal government's motives in its investigation of him. He repeatedly suggested the probe is groundless because he has yet to be indicted more than a year after the FBI raided his home in New Orleans. Carter, 37, raised nearly five times as much money as Jefferson, but she was largely outflanked in the endorsement game. Jefferson picked up the backing of Mayor Ray Nagin and other prominent black politicians. The endorsements spoke to Jefferson's solid footing in New Orleans politics. He arrived here in the 1970s as a Harvard-educated lawyer from rural north Louisiana, the sixth of 10 children brought up in a three-room country home.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Uneasy Alliance Is Taming One Insurgent Bastion Municipal services remain a wreck; local governments, while reviving, are still barely functioning; and years of fighting have damaged much of Ramadi. The insurgency in Anbar — a mix of Islamic militants, former Baathists and recalcitrant tribesmen — still thrives among the province’s overwhelmingly Sunni population, killing American and Iraqi security forces and civilians alike. [This was underscored by three suicide car-bomb attacks in Ramadi on Monday and Tuesday, in which at least 15 people were killed and 47 were wounded, American officials said. Eight American service members — five marines and three soldiers — were killed in two attacks on Thursday and Friday in Anbar, the American military said.] Furthermore, some American officials readily acknowledge that they have entered an uncertain marriage of convenience with the tribes, some of whom were themselves involved in the insurgency, to one extent or another. American officials are also negotiating with elements of the 1920 Revolution Brigades, a leading insurgent group in Anbar, to join their fight against Al Qaeda. These sudden changes have raised questions about the ultimate loyalties of the United States’ new allies. “One day they’re laying I.E.D.’s, the next they’re police collecting a pay check,” said Lt. Thomas R. Mackesy, an adviser to an Iraqi Army unit in Juwayba, east of Ramadi, referring to improvised explosive devices. And it remains unclear whether any of the gains in Anbar will transfer to other troubled areas of Iraq — like Baghdad, Diyala Province, Mosul and Kirkuk, where violence rages and the ethnic and sectarian landscape is far more complicated. Still, the progress has inspired an optimism in the American command that, among some officials, borders on giddiness. It comes after years of fruitless efforts to drive a wedge between moderate resistance fighters and those, like Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who seem beyond compromise. “There are some people who would say we’ve won the war out here,” said Col. John. A. Koenig, a planning officer for the Marines who oversees governing and economic development issues in Anbar. “I’m cautiously optimistic as we’re going forward.” For most of the past few years, the Government Center in downtown Ramadi, the seat of the provincial government, was under near-continual siege by insurgents, who reduced it to little more than a bullet-ridden bunker of broken concrete, sandbags and trapped marines. Entering meant sprinting from an armored vehicle to the front door of the building to evade snipers’ bullets. Now, however, the compound and nearby buildings are being renovated to create offices for the provincial administration, council and governor. Hotels are being built next door for the waves of visitors the government expects once it is back in business. On the roof of the main building, Capt. Jason Arthaud, commander of Company B, First Battalion, Sixth Marines, said the building had taken no sniper fire since November. “Just hours of peace and quiet,” he deadpanned. “And boredom.” Violence has fallen swiftly throughout Ramadi and its sprawling rural environs, residents and American and Iraqi officials said. Last summer, the American military recorded as many as 25 violent acts a day in the Ramadi region, ranging from shootings and kidnappings to roadside bombs and suicide attacks. In the past several weeks, the average has dropped to four acts of violence a day, American military officials said. On a recent morning, American and Iraqi troops, accompanied by several police officers, went on a foot patrol through a market in the Malaab neighborhood of Ramadi. Only a couple of months ago, American and Iraqi forces would enter the area only in armored vehicles. People stopped and stared. The sight of police and military forces in the area, particularly on foot, was still novel. The new calm is eerie and unsettling, particularly for anyone who knew the city even several months ago. “The complete change from night to day gives me pause,” said Capt. Brice Cooper, 26, executive officer of Company B, First Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, First Infantry Division, which has been stationed in the city and its outskirts since last summer. “A month and a half ago we were getting shot up. Now we’re doing civil affairs work.” The turnabout began last September, when a federation of tribes in the Ramadi area came together as the Anbar Salvation Council to oppose the fundamentalist militants of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Among the council’s founders were members of the Abu Ali Jassem tribe, based in a rural area of northern Ramadi. The tribe’s leader, Sheik Tahir Sabbar Badawie, said in a recent interview that members of his tribe had fought in the insurgency that kept the Americans pinned down on their bases in Anbar for most of the last four years. “If your country was occupied by Iraq, would you fight?” he asked. “Enough said.” But while the anti-American sheiks in Anbar and Al Qaeda both opposed the Americans, their goals were different. The sheiks were part of a relatively moderate front that sought to drive the Americans out of Iraq; some were also fighting to restore Sunni Arab power. But Al Qaeda wanted to go even further and impose a fundamentalist Islamic state in Anbar, a plan that many of the sheiks did not share. Al Qaeda’s fighters began to use killing, intimidation and financial coercion to divide the tribes and win support for their agenda. They killed about 210 people in the Abu Ali Jassem tribe alone and kidnapped others, demanding ransoms as high as 65,000 per person, Sheik Badawie said. For all the sheiks’ hostility toward the Americans, they realized that they had a bigger enemy, or at least one that needed to be fought first, as a matter of survival. The council sought financial and military support from the Iraqi and American governments. In return the sheiks volunteered hundreds of tribesmen for duty as police officers and agreed to allow the construction of joint American-Iraqi police and military outposts throughout their tribal territories. A similar dynamic is playing out elsewhere in Anbar, a desert region the size of New York State that stretches west of Baghdad to the Syrian and Jordanian borders. Tribal cooperation with the American and Iraqi commands has led to expanded police forces in the cities of Husayba, Hit, Rutba, Baghdadi and Falluja, officials say. With the help of the Anbar sheiks, the military equation immediately became simpler for the Americans in Ramadi. The number of enemies they faced suddenly diminished, American and Iraqi officials said. They were able to move more freely through large areas. With the addition of the tribal recruits, the Americans had enough troops to build and operate garrisons in areas they cleared, many of which had never seen any government security presence before. And the Americans were now fighting alongside people with a deep knowledge of the local population and terrain, and with a sense of duty, vengeance and righteousness. “We know this area, we know the best way to talk to the people and get information from them,” said Capt. Hussein Abd Nusaif, a police commander in a neighborhood in western Ramadi, who carries a Kalashnikov with an Al Capone-style “snail drum” magazine. “We are not afraid of Al Qaeda. We will fight them anywhere and anytime.” Beginning last summer and continuing through March, the American-led joint forces pressed into the city, block by block, and swept the farmlands on its outskirts. In many places the troops met fierce resistance. Scores of American and Iraqi security troops were killed or wounded. The Ramadi region is essentially a police state now, with some 6,000 American troops, 4,000 Iraqi soldiers and 4,500 Iraqi police officers, including an auxiliary police force of about 2,000, all local tribesmen, known as the Provincial Security Force. The security forces are garrisoned in more than 65 police stations, military bases and joint American-Iraqi combat outposts, up from no more than 10 a year ago. The population of the city is officially about 400,000, though the current number appears to be much lower. To help control the flow of traffic and forestall attacks, the American military has installed an elaborate system of barricades and checkpoints. In some of the enclaves created by this system, which American commanders frequently call “gated communities,” no vehicles except bicycles and pushcarts are allowed for fear of car bombs. American commanders see the progress in Anbar as a bellwether for the rest of country. “One of the things I worry about in Baghdad is we won’t have the time to do the same kind of thing,” Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, commander of day-to-day war operations in Iraq, said in an interview here. Yet the fact that Anbar is almost entirely Sunni and not riven by the same sectarian feuds as other violent places, like Baghdad and Diyala Province, has helped to establish order. Elsewhere, security forces are largely Shiite and are perceived by many Sunnis as part of the problem. In Anbar, however, the new police force reflects the homogeneous face of the province and appears to enjoy the support of the people. Military commanders say they cannot completely account for the whereabouts of the insurgency. They say they believe that many guerrillas have been killed, while others have gone underground, laid down their arms or migrated to other parts of Anbar, particularly the corridor between Ramadi and Falluja, the town of Karma north of Falluja and the sprawling rural zones around Falluja, including Zaidon and Amariyat al-Falluja on the banks of the Euphrates River. American forces come under attack in these areas every day. Still other guerrillas, the commanders acknowledge, have joined the police force, sneaking through a vetting procedure that is set up to catch only known suspects. Many insurgents “are fighting for a different side now,” said Brig. Gen. Mark Gurganus, commander of ground forces in Anbar. “I think that’s where the majority have gone.” But American commanders say they are not particularly worried about infiltrators among the new recruits. Many of the former insurgents now in the police, they say, were probably low-level operatives who were mainly in it for the money and did relatively menial tasks, like planting roadside bombs. The speed of the buildup has led to other problems. Hiring has outpaced the building of police academies, meaning that many new officers have been deployed with little or no training. Without enough uniforms, many new officers patrol in civilian clothes, some with their heads wrapped in scarves or covered in balaclavas to conceal their identities. They look no different than the insurgents shown in mujahedeen videos. Commanders seem to regard these issues as a necessary cost of quickly building a police force in a political environment that is, in the words of Colonel Koenig, “sort of like looking through smoke.” The police force, they say, has been the most critical component of the new security plan in Anbar. Yet, oversight of the police forces by American forces and the central Iraqi government is weak, leaving open the possibility that some local leaders are using newly armed tribal members as their personal death squads to settle old scores. Several American officers who work with the Iraqi police said a lot of police work was conducted out of their view, particularly at night. “It’s like the Mafia,” one American soldier in Juwayba said. General Odierno said, “We have to watch them very closely to make sure we’re not forming militias.” But there is a new sense of commitment by the police, American and Iraqi officials say, in part because they are patrolling their own neighborhoods. Many were motivated to join after they or their communities were attacked by Al Qaeda, and their successes have made them an even greater target of insurgent car bombs and suicide attacks. Abd Muhammad Khalaf, 28, a policeman in the Jazeera district on Ramadi’s northern edge, is typical. He joined the police after Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia killed two of his brothers, he said. “I will die when God wills it,” he said. “But before I die, I will support my friends and kill some terrorists.” Some tribal leaders now working with the Americans say they harbor deep resentment toward the Shiite-led administration of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, accusing it of pursuing a sectarian agenda. Yet they also say they are invested in the democratic process now. After boycotting the national elections in 2005, many are now planning to participate in the next round of provincial elections, which have yet to be scheduled, as a way to build on the political and military gains they have made in recent months. “Since I was a little boy, I have seen nothing but warfare — against the Kurds, Iranians, Kuwait, the Americans,” Sheik Badawie said. “We are tired of war. We are going to fight through the ballot box.” Already, tribal leaders are participating in local councils that have been formed recently throughout the Ramadi area under the guidance of the American military. Iraqi and American officials say the sheiks’ embrace of representative government reflects the new realities of power in Anbar. “Out here it’s been, ‘Who can defend his people?’ ” said Brig. Gen. John R. Allen, deputy commanding general of coalition forces in Anbar. “After the war it’s, ‘Who was able to reconstruct?’ ” Indeed, American and Iraqi officials say that to hold on to the security gains and the public’s support, they must provide services to residents in areas they have tamed. But successful development, they argue, will depend on closing the divide between the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad, which has long ignored the province, and the local leadership in Anbar, which has long tried to remain independent from the capital. If that fails, they say, the Iraqi and American governments may have helped to organize and arm a potent enemy.

And the answer is?","completion":"The person who became the British Prime Minister in June 2007 is Gordon Brown. James Gordon Brown was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on February 20, 1951. He is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from June 27, 2007, until May 11, 2010. He succeeded Tony Blair as both the Labour Party leader and the Prime Minister after Blair decided to step down from both positions. Before becoming Prime Minister, Brown held various critical positions in the British government. He had a long and distinguished career in politics, which began in 1983 when he was elected to Parliament as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Dunfermline East, a position he held until 2005 when the constituency boundaries were changed and he became MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. Most notably, Gordon Brown served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Tony Blair's government from 1997 to 2007. As Chancellor, Brown was responsible for the United Kingdom's economic and financial matters. During his tenure, he was able to maintain economic stability and presided over a period of sustained growth. Brown was also instrumental in granting the Bank of England operational independence and played a significant role in shaping the UK's monetary and fiscal policies. As Prime Minister, Gordon Brown faced several challenges, including managing the aftermath of the global financial crisis, which hit the United Kingdom hard, and addressing issues such as global poverty, climate change, and international terrorism. Brown's government introduced measures to stabilize the UK's financial system and help the country recover from the economic downturn. Additionally, Brown played an essential role on the international stage by hosting the G20 summit in London in 2009, where leaders discussed measures to coordinate their responses to the global financial crisis. Brown's tenure as Prime Minister also had its fair share of controversies and setbacks. Among them were criticisms of his leadership style, handling of the Parliamentary expenses scandal, and loss of public support due to the Labour Party's handling of the Iraq War and the financial crisis. Gordon Brown's time in office came to an end after the 2010 general election, in which the Labour Party failed to secure a majority. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, managed to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, which marked the end of Brown's term as Prime Minister. Brown then stepped down as the leader of the Labour Party and later retired from British politics in 2015."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for 100 million (1.2 billion today) but Denmark refused to sell it.

One of the actual reasons behind US interest in Greenland could be the vast natural resources of the island.

Summarize this article: The move follows an investigation into Indonesian abattoirs by Australia's ABC broadcaster, which showed graphic footage of animals being mistreated. It prompted a public outcry and demands for the government to act. Last week, Canberra suspended exports to abattoirs shown in the programme, but now it has issued a blanket ban. Indonesian officials have rebuffed claims of widespread animal cruelty in their abattoirs. Bayu Krisnamurti, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, told the BBC that the coverage had created a negative perception of Indonesia overseas. \\"I think ABC practised unfair journalism, only the bad practices were portrayed. We see this as an isolated incident. \\"It's against the law in Indonesia to be so harsh and cruel to animals. Indonesian regulations explicity say we must practise animal welfare in handling animals in the slaughterhouse.\\" He acknowledged that it could hurt the country's ability to procure cattle. He said that New Zealand and the US were being looked at as possible alternative suppliers, but Jakarta had not yet contacted either. The ban is the result of public revulsion and outrage at the gruesome footage from Indonesia's abattoirs that was broadcast last week in an ABC TV documentary, says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney. It showed steers being whipped, beaten and slashed repeatedly, and suffering terrible pain before they are slaughtered. Read more from Nick Bryant's blog Australia first announced a ban on live exports to the 12 abattoirs featured in the programme. But the public demanded more, signing online petitions to halt the trade with Indonesia and pressing lawmakers in Canberra to bring in a complete ban, our correspondent says. Australia's Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig said Canberra would impose a six-month initial suspension on shipments to Indonesia. \\"A sustainable live cattle export industry must be built on the ability to safeguard the welfare of the animals. The trade to Indonesia will only recommence when we are certain industry is able to comply with that.\\" Lyn White, who filmed the graphic images, and is the campaign director for Animals Australia, welcomed the move. \\"There has been an extraordinary outpouring of rage that our cattle have been treated like this and have been supplied for such treatment. So this is a first step,\\" she told Australian television. An early indication that a blanket ban was about to come into effect came on Tuesday, when about 2,000 cattle were not allowed to board a ship in Western Australia that was about to set sail for Indonesia. Australia exports more than 700,000 cattle each year - the vast majority to Indonesia. Australian farmers have warned that a ban would destroy many rural livelihoods. Butchers have already reported that beef sales are down by up to 15%. But Luke Bowen from the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association said he accepted the government's action, even though it would prove costly. \\"It is going to hurt, we know that,\\" he said. \\"There's tens of thousands of cattle in the supply chains now. But we have to stay focused on the animal welfare outcome, and we're very encouraged by the government's commitment to the trade in the long term.\\"","completion":"An Australian news channel showed a video of animals being mistreated in Indonesian slaughterhouses. This made many people in Australia very upset and angry. They asked the government to do something about it. Last week, the government stopped sending animals to the places shown in the video. But now, they have decided to stop sending animals to all of Indonesia. Some people in Indonesia don't think this is fair, because they believe only a few places are treating animals badly, not all of them. But for now, Australia won't send any more animals to Indonesia. This might cause problems for Australian farmers, who were selling a lot of cattle to Indonesia, and for Indonesian people looking for other places to get their meat."},{"prompt":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

The paper that Randy wrote was worse than the paper of Christopher, since","completion":"Randy's paper lacked several key elements that made Christopher's work stand out as superior. To begin with, the structure and organization of Randy's paper were poorly executed, causing the readers to have difficulty navigating through the various points and arguments presented. The absence of a clear introduction and conclusion section further complicated this issue, leaving the audience uncertain about the central idea and the overarching purpose of the paper. Conversely, Christopher's paper followed a logical progression and was well-organized, allowing the readers to easily comprehend different sections and ideas. The introduction effectively set the context and provided a concise thesis statement that guided the reader throughout the paper. Additionally, Christopher's conclusion was strong, leaving the audience with a clear understanding of the purpose of the paper and the implications of the findings. Another reason Randy's paper was worse than Christopher's was due to the inconsistent and weak references provided. Randy did not include pertinent research and evidence to support his arguments, which considerably weakened the credibility of his conclusions. Moreover, there were numerous instances where Randy's sources were outdated, of questionable reputation, or taken entirely out of context. These issues combined led to a paper that was undermined by its own inadequacies in terms of evidence and citations. On the other hand, Christopher's paper was carefully researched, and every claim made was substantiated by strong and relevant scientific sources. By doing this, Christopher not only boosted the credibility of his own work but also demonstrated an ability to synthesize information from various sources, displaying an in-depth understanding of the topic. Beyond referencing issues, Randy's paper underperformed in comparison to Christopher's because of the lack of critical analysis and original thought. Randy's paper primarily summarized existing literature and merely rehashed prevalent ideas with little effort to contribute novel insights or evaluate existing ones critically. This superficial approach meant that the paper lacked originality and substance, devaluing its overall significance. In contrast, Christopher's paper demonstrated a profound level of critical thinking, which allowed him to identify the gaps in existing research and to present his own unique perspective on the topic. By integrating recent and relevant findings, Christopher was able to weave an argument that addressed current debates in the field, effectively showcasing his aptitude for engaging complex issues and proposing innovative solutions. Lastly, Randy's writing style was convoluted and laced with grammatical errors, which detracted from the overall readability of his work. The lack of clarity and coherence in Randy's writing made it challenging for readers to engage with his ideas, diminishing potential connections and the impact of his arguments. In comparison, Christopher's paper was written with great care, in a clear and concise manner that navigated effortlessly between complex ideas. The polished writing invited the readers to engage with the work, making the paper more appealing and digestible. In conclusion, Randy's paper was worse than Christopher's for several reasons, including the lack of proper organization, inadequate referencing, minimal critical analysis, and poor writing quality. In contrast, Christopher's paper stood out as a well-crafted piece of work that showcased his research capabilities, critical thinking skills, and writing prowess. As a result, Christopher's work is the clear winner in this comparison, demonstrating that attention to detail, strong evidence, insightful analysis, and polished writing are essential components of a successful paper."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the previous evening,--March 12th,--the monotony of the camp had been unexpectedly disturbed by the arrival, from the direction of Salt Lake City, of a horseman completely exhausted by fatigue and cold, who proved to be no other than Mr. Kane, whose mission to the Mormons by way of California was at that time totally unknown to the army. The next morning he introduced himself to the Governor, was received as his guest, and remained in conference with him throughout the day. What was the character of their communication is unknown, except by inference from its results. When presented to Judge Eckels, on the following day, Mr. Kane exhibited to him the letters he bore from the President, and other letters, also, from Brigham Young, accrediting him as a negotiator in the existing difficulties. To General Johnston he showed nothing; nor did the Governor, to the knowledge of the camp, acquaint either that officer or any other person with the purport of his business. It was evident to everybody, however, that the Mormon leaders, conscious of their inability to resist the force by which they would be assailed so soon as the snow should melt upon the mountains, were engaged in an effort, of which Mr. Kane was the agent, to secure through the Governor, if possible, indemnity for their past offences, in consideration of acknowledgment of his authority.

Sentence 1: Had they any clue, or 103 would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes? This sentence presents two possibilities: a) They had a clue, meaning they had some idea or knowledge about the crime. b) The whole thing remains in the category of undiscovered crimes, meaning they had no clue or knowledge about the crime. Sentence 2: Did they seriously think it would remain under wraps? This sentence implies doubt about whether they believed the crime would stay hidden or not be discovered. Now, let's analyze the logical relationship between the two sentences: If the first sentence is true, it means that either they had a clue or the crime remains undiscovered. In both cases, the second sentence can be true, as it is asking about their belief regarding whether the crime would remain hidden. a) If they had a clue: They could still doubt whether the crime would remain under wraps. b) If the crime remains undiscovered: They could have thought that it might be discovered eventually, thus creating doubt about the crime staying under wraps.

With a 38-35 victory over the New York Giants at Giants Stadium Saturday night, the New England Patriots became the second team in the modern era of the National Football League to go undefeated (16-0) in the regular season. The only other team to have achieved this feat was the Miami Dolphins in 1972, who were 14-0 due to a different regular season structure at the time. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Patriots and the Dolphins played the same number of games.","completion":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins played the same number of games when they had their respective undefeated seasons. It's true that both teams completed their regular seasons with undefeated win-loss records - the Patriots with 16-0, and the Dolphins with 14-0. However, the total number of games played by each team in their respective regular seasons is different. The Patriots played 16 games in their regular 2007 season, while the Dolphins played just 14 games in their regular 1972 season. This disparity is due to the different structures of the NFL regular season in each of those years. In 1972, when the Dolphins achieved their perfect season, the NFL regular season lasted just 14 games. The NFL later expanded the regular season to 16 games in 1978, which was the structure in 2007 when the Patriots had their undefeated regular season. Each team also played in playoff games, culminating with a Super Bowl victory for the Miami Dolphins in 1973 during Super Bowl VII. Comparatively, the New England Patriots advanced to the Super Bowl after their perfect 2007 regular season but lost to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII. The number of playoff games played varies based on how many games the team had to win to reach the Super Bowl, but that number is not reflected in the regular season record. In conclusion, although both the 1972 Miami Dolphins and the 2007 New England Patriots achieved the remarkable feat of going undefeated in their respective regular seasons, they did not play the same number of regular-season games due to differences in the NFL's regular-season structure at the time.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 19:24 EST, 20 October 2013 | UPDATED: 19:24 EST, 20 October 2013 A Catholic church has beensold to the Muslim community after a decline in worshippers. St Peter’s has closed its doors to Christian worshippers following the recent sale. Despite the sale, the church said that the local parish, Cobridge, in Stoke-on-Trent, would continue to exist and money from the sale will be used to benefit parishioners. A Catholic church in Stoke-on-Trent has been sold to the Muslim community after a decline in worshippers The identity of the buyers, who are part of the Muslim community, has not been disclosed. Churchgoers have declined in recent years, with the number of people attending","completion":"St Peter's Catholic Church dropping significantly. This decline in attendance can be attributed to various factors, including the general trend of decreasing religiosity in the UK, an aging congregation, and the challenges posed by the modern world, such as busy schedules, social media, and the rise of secular values. Many have expressed mixed emotions at St Peter's closure and its subsequent repurposing as a place of worship for the Muslim community. Some parishioners mourn the loss of their long-standing spiritual home, while others welcome the opportunity to forge new interfaith relationships and find common ground with their Muslim neighbors. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged that the sale of the church has ensured that the building will still serve a meaningful purpose as a place of worship, rather than being converted into a commercial or residential property. As for the local Catholic community of Cobridge, the sale of St Peter's has generated much-needed funds, which will be used to provide resources for the remaining members of the congregation. This will include investing in outreach programs designed to reinvigorate the faith of lapsed Catholics and attract new adherents to the church. Additionally, the funding will support ongoing maintenance to the parish's other facilities and charitable endeavors within the local community. The Muslim community, who will soon call St Peter's their own place of worship, have expressed their gratitude and eagerness to establish a warm and welcoming environment for all who wish to attend. They have emphasized their commitment to promoting understanding, tolerance, and respect between the different faith groups in Stoke-on-Trent and celebrating the city's diverse and multicultural heritage. In many ways, the story of St Peter's, while bittersweet for its longstanding Catholic congregation, is emblematic of a broader trend in post-industrial cities, such as Stoke-on-Trent, where dwindling resources and changing demographics have necessitated innovative solutions to repurpose underutilized religious buildings. Rather than seeing these transformations as a loss, it is important to view them as an opportunity for growth, progression, and unity among different faiths. Throughout history, religious institutions have played a crucial role in offering comfort, hope, and a sense of belonging to their adherents. It is essential that these institutions evolve and adapt to the needs of their communities, even if that means transitioning from one faith to another. The sale of St Peter's Catholic Church to the Muslim community demonstrates the possibility of fostering understanding, cooperation, and mutual support between different religious groups, ultimately showcasing how the power of faith can transcend individual beliefs and serve as a unifying force in society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: As Internet users become more dependent on the Internet to store information, are people remember less? If you know your computer will save information, why store it in your own personal memory, your brain? Experts are wondering if the Internet is changing what we remember and how. In a recent study, Professor Betsy Sparrow conducted some experiments. She and her research team wanted to know the Internet is changing memory. In the first experiment, they gave people 40 unimportant facts to type into a computer. The first group of people understood thatthe computer would save the information. The second group understood that the computer would not save it. Later, the second group remembered the information better. People in the first group knew they could find the information again, so they did not try to remember it. In another experiment, the researchers gave people facts to remember, and told them where to find the information on the Internet. The information was in a specific computer folder . Surprisingly, people later remember the folder location better than the facts. When people use the Internet, they do not remember the information. Rather, they remember how to find it. This is called \\"transactive memory \\". According to Sparrow, we are not becoming people with poor memories as a result of the Internet. Instead, computer users are developing stronger transactive memories; that is, people are learning how to organize huge quantities of information so that they are able to access it at a later date. This doesn't mean we are becoming either more or less intelligent, but there is no doubt that the way we use memory is changing. Question: What can we learn about the first experiment? - Sparrow's team typed the information into a computer. - The two groups remembered the information equally well. - The first group did not try to remember the formation. - The second group did not understand the information.

Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary. His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing. The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church. As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man. At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw. But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road. As he did so he glanced back. A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it.

Donald took the lead in the musical instead of Ryan because","completion":"Donald took the lead in the musical instead of Ryan because he showcased exceptional talent, dedication, and innate understanding of the role, ultimately impressing the director and earning him the coveted position. From the outset, it was clear that both Donald and Ryan were strong contenders for the lead role in the musical. However, there were significant differences in their personal qualities and skills that ultimately led to the director's decision. Here are some of the factors that tilted the balance in Donald's favor: 1. Acting skills: While both contestants were undoubtedly talented, Donald demonstrated a powerful stage presence and a rare ability to connect with the audience. His portrayal of the character was nuanced and believable, displaying a deep understanding of the character's emotions, motivations, and complexities. In contrast, Ryan's performance, although commendable, sometimes lacked the depth and authenticity required for the lead character. 2. Singing abilities: The musical demanded an actor with strong vocal prowess and a wide range. Donald exceeded these expectations by delivering soulful, pitch-perfect renditions of each song. He showed his adaptability and versatility in different music styles and genres. Ryan, although possessing a pleasant voice, was evidently less proficient in hitting challenging notes and maintaining their stability, which detracted from the overall impact of the performance. 3. Dancing expertise: In addition to their acting and singing capabilities, the lead role required a high level of mastery in dancing. Donald's performance revealed an extensive background in dance, as he navigated complex choreography with ease and grace, naturally embodying the role. On the other hand, Ryan struggled to keep up with the dance routines, and his movements lacked precision and fluidity. 4. Commitment and dedication: Throughout the audition process, Donald consistently proved his commitment to the role. He was the first to arrive at rehearsals, the last to leave, and always came prepared and eager to learn. He took constructive criticism well, made improvements based on feedback, and never hesitated to step up and help others when necessary. This level of dedication was unmatched by Ryan, who occasionally missed rehearsals and seemed less focused on refining his performance. 5. Professionalism and team spirit: A successful production requires a collaborative spirit among the cast and crew. Donald's congenial nature and willingness to support his fellow cast members made him the ideal candidate for the lead role. He was quick to offer assistance, share tips, and uplift his co-actors, engendering camaraderie and mutual respect within the group. Ryan, unfortunately, did not display the same warmth and collaboration, coming across as somewhat reserved and focused solely on his individual performance. 6. A better fit for the character: Ultimately, the director felt that Donald captured the essence of the lead character more accurately and authentically. He possessed an innate connection to the character's emotional journey and conveyed this through his performance, making him an ideal fit for the role. In conclusion, while both Donald and Ryan demonstrated talent and potential, Donald's exceptional acting, singing, and dancing skills, together with his unwavering dedication, professionalism, and strong collaborative spirit, set him apart as the clear choice for the lead role in the musical."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese civilisation is traditionally said to have originated in central China, by the Yellow River, when the first Xia Dynasty ruled the region around 4,000 years ago. But a separate, complex society may have originated around 2,400 years earlier in the north-east of the country and gradually spread south, a study has suggested. Until now the Hongshan culture had not been credited as being the source of Chinese civilisation because it was understood to have been a small, remote and self-contained culture miles away from the river. Chinese culture and civilisation is traditionally said to have originated by the Yellow River (pictured) when the first Xia Dynasty ruled the region, but new research suggests a complex civilisation not only originated around 2,400 years earlier, it may have been rooted across Inner Mongolia instead This would have made it an ideal environment for the OPTIONS: - China people to live. - Chinese people to live. - Hongshan people to live. - Inner Mongolia people to live. - Xia Dynasty people to live. - Yellow River people to live.","completion":"Hongshan people to live. The presence of this advanced civilization in Inner Mongolia presented a unique perspective on the timeline and origins of Chinese civilization. As archaeologists and historians continue to excavate and interpret the findings, they began to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Hongshan culture and its potential impact on later dynasties. This revelation led to an internal debate among scholars and the Chinese people, challenging conventional wisdom on China's historical narrative. The expanded understanding of the Hongshan culture's role in Chinese civilization encouraged researchers to rethink their approach to the origins and progression of Chinese history. In the story's first ending, the Hongshan culture's strong influence on the formation of the Xia Dynasty and other subsequent dynasties is acknowledged. The Chinese people come to embrace this complex and ancient society as an integral part of their civilization and cultural heritage. This reevaluation of history bridges the regional divides between central China and the northeast, fostering a stronger sense of national unity. The Hongshan culture's advanced technologies and innovations spread throughout the region, providing a foundation for the flourishing of other Chinese dynasties. The influence of the Hongshan can be seen in various aspects of Chinese art, architecture, and rituals, reinforcing its status as a prominent force in Chinese history. The significance of the Yellow River to China's development remains intact, as both regions contribute to building a broader understanding of China's cultural roots. In the story's second ending, the Hongshan culture is recognized as a separate civilization parallel to the origin of the Xia Dynasty. The investigations and discoveries surrounding the Hongshan mystery lead to the conclusion that two distinct cultures blossomed independently. However, a certain degree of mutual influence between these two complex societies cannot be denied. As a result, both central China and Inner Mongolia come to appreciate their unique contributions to the tapestry of Chinese civilization. History enthusiasts and researchers delve into uncovering the intricacies of these parallel societies, their similarities, and differences, and the ways in which their respective histories intertwined. Regardless of which ending is chosen, the discovery of the Hongshan culture's significance serves as a testament to the rich and complex history of the Chinese civilization. Over time, the Chinese people accept the idea that their civilization may have multiple origins. The appreciation of multiple roots encourages a deeper understanding and respect for the diverse cultural expressions that exist in modern China. These endings invite the exploration of history through a multifaceted lens, allowing for a more nuanced perspective on the development of human societies. Additionally, the acceptance of diverse origins fosters an environment for the continued growth of knowledge and understanding, contributing to the thriving and dynamic culture of China."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This rimfire cartridge, often abbreviated as .22 WMR or .22 Magnum, was introduced by Winchester in 1959. It offers greater performance than the traditional .22 Long Rifle cartridge, with higher bullet velocities and increased energy levels. The .22 WMR was initially loaded with a 40-grain (2.6 g) bullet weight, with velocities in the 2,000 feet per second (610 m/s) range from a rifle barrel. Nowadays, the cartridge is available with various bullet weights, ranging from 50 grains (3.2 g) at 1,530 feet per second (470 m/s) to 30 grains (1.9 g) at 2,200 feet per second (670 m/s). Its accuracy is typically around 1 MOA, making it effective for hunting small game and varmints.

In the common implementation, a gasoline engine is connected to a traditional transmission, which is in turn connected to an epicyclic gear system's planet carrier. An electric motor/generator is connected to the central \`\`sun'' gear, which is normally un-driven in typical epicyclic systems. Both sources of power can be fed into the transmission's output at the same time, splitting power between them. In common examples, between one-quarter and half of the engine's power can be fed into the sun gear. Depending on the implementation, the transmission in front of the epicyclic system may be greatly simplified, or eliminated completely. EVTs are capable of continuously modulating output/input speed ratios like mechanical CVTs, but offer the distinct benefit of being able to also apply power from two different sources to one output, as well as potentially reducing overall complexity dramatically. is the transmission and motor the same thing?

Sources said an execution-style attack on the eve of the election killed Hussain, a senior vice president of the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI. The party made headlines after nationwide elections on May 11, alleging vote rigging in Karachi and elsewhere. Amid the allegations, election officials held a revote Sunday for one National Assembly seat and two Provincial Assembly seats in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city.

Step 3: Write a detailed and engaging description Begin the advertisement by describing the pet's physical characteristics, including breed, age, color, and size. Highlight any noteworthy features, such as a unique coat pattern or eye color. If the pet is a purebred, mention its pedigree. Step 4: Highlight the pet's personality Describe the pet's temperament, behavior, and any special traits that would make it a great companion. Include information about its energy level, sociability with people and other animals, and any training it has received. Step 5: Provide information on health and vaccinations Include details on the pet's health, such as vaccination history, any health conditions or special needs, and whether the pet has been spayed or neutered. Being transparent about the pet's health will help potential owners make an informed decision. Step 6: Mention any included accessories or supplies If the pet comes with any accessories or supplies, such as a crate, toys, or food, mention these in the advertisement. This can be a selling point for potential buyers, as it provides added value. Step 7: Include clear, high-quality photos Ensure your advertisement includes several clear, high-quality photos of the pet to give potential buyers an accurate visual representation. Show the pet from various angles and in different settings to showcase its personality and appearance. Step 8: Provide contact information and pricing Finally, include contact information (phone number, email address, or social media profiles) to allow potential buyers to get in touch with any questions or to arrange a meeting. Include the pet's adoption fee and any other relevant costs. Step 9: Edit and proofread the advertisement Before publishing the advertisement, proofread it for any grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors. Verify that all details are accurate and clear, and that the advertisement presents a positive image of the pet. Step 10: Publish the advertisement Once the advertisement is complete, publish it on various online platforms, such as social media, pet adoption websites, and local classifieds. Monitor responses, answer inquiries promptly, and update the advertisement as needed to ensure a successful pet adoption."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The original members of the group were lead singer Bryan Abrams (born November 16, 1969), second tenor Mark Calderon (born September 27, 1970), second tenor Sam Watters (born July 23, 1970) and baritone Kevin Thornton (born June 17, 1969). They formed in 1985 and broke up in 1998 before reuniting in 2010, with various lineups since. As of 2016, they operate as a trio with Abrams, Calderon and Adam Emil. Kevin Thornton left the group in October 1998 to pursue the ministry. He became a licensed minister, and has since served as an evangelist, youth pastor and worship leader at his home church, Without Walls Church, in Fort Worth, Texas. He operates Kevin Thornton Ministries in Texas. In 2008, he released a solo album, Conversions, blending contemporary hip-hop/rap with gospel and soul music. Sam Watters pursued a career as a record producer, achieving success producing for Jessica Simpson, Celine Dion, Fantasia, Anastacia, Natasha Bedingfield, Kelly Clarkson, 98 Degrees, Blake Lewis, and others. Watters is a member of the production/songwriting team The Runaways, which also includes Rico Love, Wayne Wilkins, Ryan Tedder, and Louis Biancaniello. He married R&B singer and former American Idol contestant Tamyra Gray in 2006. Mark Calderon worked with artists such as Stevie Brock, whose 2002 remake of \\"All 4 Love\\" reached number 1 on the Disney charts; and with IPV, who is signed with Wright Entertainment and had songs played on the television series House and Knight Rider. In 1992, Calderon married Lisa Smedley-Calderon, who was formerly Color Me Badd's fashion stylist. In 2001, Bryan Abrams released a solo album entitled Welcome to Me. In 2007, he co-starred on the VH1 reality TV series Mission: Man Band, which also included former boy band members Jeff Timmons of 98 Degrees, Chris Kirkpatrick of *NSYNC and Rich Cronin of Lyte Funkie Ones, seeing if they could make it as a new group. The show was canceled after seven episodes. In 2007, after being approached by Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope, Abrams co-wrote and recorded an appearance on the Insane Clown Posse song \\"Truth Dare\\", which was released on the compilations Psychopathics from Outer Space 3 (2007) and Featuring Freshness (2011). In 2010, Abrams wrote three songs for Kool & the Gang, singing lead on all three tracks. On August 22, 2000, Giant Records released the compilation album The Best of Color Me Badd.

Available choices: A). yes B). it is not possible to tell C). no","completion":"C). no Given the premise \\"I didn't know about this, I swear,\\" we can infer that the speaker is claiming to not have prior knowledge about the subject. Assuming this statement to be true, it directly conflicts with the hypothesis \\"I knew all about this.\\" Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the answer would be C). no. The existence of opposing statements, in this case, between the premise and the hypothesis, helps build the foundation for a counter-argument against the hypothesis. As per standard rules of logic, one cannot simultaneously have complete knowledge and lack knowledge about the same subject. In this case, the speaker's insistence on not knowing about the subject would strengthen their opposition to the hypothesis. To elaborate further, let's break down the two statements: 1. Premise: \\"I didn't know about this, I swear.\\" The speaker asserts that they were unaware of the subject, and they emphasize this claim by swearing. This suggests they feel strongly about ensuring that the listener understands that they had no prior knowledge of the matter. 2. Hypothesis: \\"I knew all about this.\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that the speaker had complete knowledge of the subject. This notion directly contradicts the premise, making it impossible for the premise to entail the hypothesis. In conclusion, given the true premise \\"I didn't know about this, I swear,\\" it does not entail the hypothesis \\"I knew all about this.\\" The nature of these opposing statements eliminates the possibility of the premise supporting the hypothesis, and therefore, the answer is C). no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - by themselves - in fours - in threes - in pairs A: Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, I will research how sunspots occur and then select the most appropriate choice from the given options. Step 1: Research how sunspots occur. Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the surface of the sun that appear darker than the surrounding areas. They are caused by concentration of magnetic field lines which inhibits convection, resulting in reduced temperature compared to the surrounding area. Step 2: Identify which choice best represents how sunspots occur. Based on the research, sunspots occur due to magnetic field line concentration. Now, let's review the given choices and select the most appropriate one: - by themselves: This doesn't directly explain how sunspots are formed. - in fours: There is no evidence suggesting that sunspots specifically occur in groups of four. - in threes: There is no evidence suggesting that sunspots specifically occur in groups of three. - in pairs: Sunspots often occur in pairs, with one sunspot having a north magnetic pole and the other having a south magnetic pole. This configuration is a result of the concentrated magnetic field lines. Step 3: Choose the best answer based on the research. From the available options, the most appropriate answer is \\"in pairs\\", as sunspots frequently occur in pairs with opposite magnetic poles due to the concentration of magnetic field lines.

On his arrival he observes a group of hippies lead by George Berger (Treat Williams) begging for change from a trio of horseback riders. Later Claude catches the runaway horse the hippies have rented and uses it to show off his riding skills to one of the trio of strangers--an upper class débutante. While returning the horse to the hippies, Claude accepts their invitation to be shown around.In the course of an evening Claude gets stoned then is introduced to the race and class issues of the 1960's. On the morning after, George finds a scrap of newspaper identifying the mysterious girl. The group including Hud (Dorsey Wright), Jeannie (Annie Golden) and Woof (Don Dacus) crash a private party where the girl--Sheila Franklin (Beverly D'Angelo)--secretly enjoys the disruption of her rigid environment. After the group is arrested, Claude uses the only money he has to pay George's fine so that George can find the funds to get the rest of them released. Meanwhile, at the prison, Woof's refusal to have his hair cut leads into the title song.Unsuccessful at convincing Sheila to get the funds from her father, George returns to his parents' home and is able to convince his mother to give him enough money to have the others released.

Jean Paul Getty (; December 15, 1892 - June 6, 1976) was an American-British industrialist. He founded the Getty Oil Company, and in 1957 Fortune magazine named him the richest living American, while the 1966 Guinness Book of Records named him as the world's richest private citizen, worth an estimated 1.2 billion (approximately 9.05 billion in 2017). At his death, he was worth more than 6 billion (approximately 25.80 billion in 2017). On July 10, 1973, in Rome, 'Ndrangheta kidnappers abducted Getty's 16-year-old grandson, John Paul Getty III, and demanded by telephone a 17 million payment (approximately 93.7 million in 2017) for the young man's safe return. However, \\"the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather.\\" John Paul Getty Jr. asked his father for the money, but was refused. In November 1973, an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike. The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid 3.2 million (approximately 17.6 million in 2017): \\"This is Paul's ear. If we don't get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.\\" When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to 3 million (approximately 16.5 million in 2017), Getty senior agreed to pay no more than 2.2 million (approximately 12.1 million in 2017) - the maximum that would be tax-deductible. He lent his son the remaining 800,000 (approximately 4.4 million in 2017) at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in a Lauria filling station, in the province of Potenza, shortly after the ransom was paid. After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but, it is claimed, Getty refused to come to the phone. Nine people associated with 'Ndrangheta were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted. Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He died 30 years later on February 5, 2011, at the age of 54. Getty defended his initial refusal to pay the ransom on two points. First, he argued that to submit to the kidnappers' demands would immediately place his other fourteen grandchildren at the risk of copy-cat kidnappers. He added: The second reason for my refusal was much broader-based.

Here is an article: As the winter of 2012 approached, nearly 20 years after he had left the White House, former President George H. W. Bush checked into a Houston hospital with a bad cough that worsened by the day. Despite increasing pain, he retained his fuddy-duddy sense of humor. “It’s not the cough that carries you off,” he joked one day to his visiting son and daughter-in-law. “It’s the coffin you go off in.” But as November turned to December and the cough turned to pneumonia, it sounded less like a joke. His oldest son, former President George W. Bush, began reviewing state funeral plans and thinking about a eulogy. The family gathered in the hospital expecting the end. The ailing president reached out to touch the swollen belly of his pregnant granddaughter, Jenna Bush Hager. “There’s death,” he said, “and there’s new life.” As it happened, the old life was not yet done. Bush rallied and eventually left the hospital. It was not his time. But two years later, his son has now essentially delivered the eulogy anyway in the form of a biography of the 41st president, one that extols the successes and treads lightly over the shortcomings of the aging patriarch of one of America’s most prominent political dynasties. Indeed, the younger Bush rushed to finish “41: A Portrait of My Father” to ensure it came out while his dad, now 90 and suffering from a condition similar to Parkinson’s disease, was still alive. The author makes no pretensions to objectivity and, in truth, this is more Hallmark card than biography. Bush’s conversational storytelling makes for engaging reading, even if the stories have been told before in interviews, profiles and books like “George Bush: The Life of a Lone Star Yankee,” by Herbert S. Parmet, and “The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty,” by Peter Schweizer and Rochelle Schweizer. That gives “41” the feel of a greatest-hits collection from family reunions at the famous oceanside compound in Kennebunkport, Me. The book takes readers through the familiar touchstones of an extraordinary life — the youngest Navy pilot for a time in World War II, shot down over the Pacific; the transplanted Texas-by-way-of-Connecticut oilman turned congressman and failed Senate candidate; the presidential courtier who served in quick succession as ambassador to the United Nations, Republican National Committee chairman, envoy to China and director of central intelligence; and finally, the loyal vice president to Ronald Reagan, patiently waiting his turn. Beyond his father’s well-known résumé, the book offers a sense of the toll a public life takes on a family, even one as accustomed to the spotlight as the Bushes. One day while the two men were fishing in Maine, the sitting president suddenly seemed ready to give it all up. “Son, I’m thinking about not running again,” he said. Asked why, he cited the unfavorable scrutiny of another son, Neil, who sat on the board of a failed savings and loan. “I know it’s tough,” George W. recalls telling his father, “but you’ve still got work to do and the country needs you.” The younger Bush was hardly immune to the pressure, even before taking office himself, and he tells a story harking back to his more hotheaded days. In a Dallas gym one day, he overheard a stranger evidently mistake him for Neil: “There’s the president’s son — he’s about to get indicted.” Bush marched over and confronted the man. “I’m not about to get indicted, and neither is my brother,” he told him, “and I’d appreciate it if you’d get your facts right instead of spreading gossip.” Getting the facts right, at least as he sees them, seems to be the reason for this book — facts not just about his father but about himself. He has said he wanted to write “41” to encourage a historical reassessment of his father’s presidency, and in the process seems to be seeking some of that for his own as well. The deep affection and respect for his father suffuses the narrative, but along the way, Bush dissects what he sees as mistakes and the lessons he drew for his own presidency. It was “shortsighted,” he says, not to defend more robustly the 1990 budget deal that broke the president’s “read my lips” anti-tax pledge, although he places the blame on “the White House” rather than on his father directly. From the elder Bush’s Supreme Court nominations of David Souter, who became one of the court’s most liberal justices, and Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation turned up an embarrassing sex scandal, Bush writes: “I learned that it is essential for a president to fully vet nominees.” When his father asked him to nudge out the White House chief of staff, John Sununu, Bush wondered why he did not do it himself. “The experience taught me a lesson,” he writes: When he was president he either made personnel changes himself or had “a close confidant (not a family member)” do it. Patrick Buchanan’s primary challenge to his father in 1992 taught him “the importance of consolidating the base,” and in 2004 he “reached out early” to “disgruntled factions of the party.” Some of this conveniently rewrites or omits parts of his own record, of course, and unsurprisingly, Bush admits to none of the father-son tensions that so many others have diagnosed over the years, which he so often scorns as psychobabble. As always, he dismisses the notion that he went to war in Iraq to finish what his father started and argues that 41 was right not to push on to Baghdad in 1991 just as he was right to do so 12 years later. He recycles scenes from his last book, “Decision Points,” telling us again that his father supported his decision to invade and that he did not ask for advice because the former president had not been briefed the way an incumbent president was. He does not reflect on his lifetime of efforts to prove himself by following in his father’s footsteps, nor does he dwell on any frustrations in trying to measure up. He even sands off the harsh edges of stories hinting at resentments that may have built up over time. When he recounts, for instance, the famous tale of his youthful drunken drive home, smashing into a neighbor’s trash can, he writes simply that his father said nothing and that was rebuke enough. Other versions of the episode over the years have suggested a more confrontational tenor, with the son challenging his father, “You want to go mano a mano right here?” For a deeper look into this fascinating relationship, we will probably have to wait for presidential historians, like Jon Meacham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer whose long-awaited biography of the elder Bush is due out next year, and Mark K. Updegrove, the director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library, who is writing a book about the two Bush presidents. For now, we have a son’s loving testimonial. With the former president fading into winter, the younger Bush’s book feels like a release of sorts, finally getting rid of whatever baggage has been there for so long. A son sits at the hospital bed, at last coming to terms. George W. Bush has nothing more to prove. His argument at this point is not with his father but with history.

Summarize this article: A red flag is anything that could be a potential problem in the future. It’s easy to get caught up in the romance, but it might be best to take a step back and evaluate the person you are seeing for who they really are. Try thinking about all of the things that you know about them, and make note of anything that is questionable. If he says he’s not ready for commitment, and that is something you are looking for, you should believe him and not try to change his mind. Red flags can also be things like a short temper, tumultuous relationships in his past, or indications of a substance abuse problem. Since you’re looking for a strong relationship, you should take your time getting to know them. The longer you spend with them, the better an idea you will have of who they really are. Don’t feel like you need to rush into something just because it feels good. One of the most exciting and fun parts of dating is getting to experience new things together. Pay attention to how your partner reacts to different situations and ask yourself if you’re comfortable with the way they handle different stressors or uncomfortable environments. For example, holidays are sometimes very high-stress situations and environments for people. How your partner acts in this environment might be a sign of how they’ll react in other high-stress situations. If you begin to feel uncomfortable, uneasy, or afraid in your relationship, don’t be afraid to leave immediately. Your partner should never threaten, hurt, or ignore you. Confide in someone you trust and cut all ties with anyone who is unhealthy for your mental and physical health. Summary:","completion":"Red flags are potential problems in a relationship, and it's important to evaluate the person you're seeing before committing. Consider their readiness for commitment, temper, past relationships, and any signs of substance abuse. Invest time in getting to know them and observe their reactions in various situations.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This was 20 years ago, maybe. My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ According to the above context, answer the following question. Who had a blackout at the bar?","completion":"The person who had a blackout at the bar is the narrator, who shared the experience of getting out of control, flirting with the barmaid, losing pool table bets, and trying to start fights.

It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Zammar\\" correctly answer the question \\"Where is Dar el Ansar?\\"? pick from the following. (1). no. (2). yes.","completion":"1. no. The response \\"Zammar\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Where is Dar el Ansar?\\" because Dar el Ansar is not a person, but a designation used by Atta to refer to their apartment at 54 Marienstrasse.

Here is a goal: How do I fold a plastic shopping bag to make it into fabric? How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of folding a plastic shopping bag into a fabric-like material, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Clean and dry the plastic bag Before starting the folding process, ensure that the plastic bag is clean and free of any dirt or moisture. This will make the final fabric more durable and easier to work with. Step 2: Flatten the plastic bag Lay the plastic bag on a flat surface and smooth it out. Remove any remaining air and ensure it's flat and wrinkle-free. Step 3: Trim the edges Using scissors, carefully cut off the handles and the bottom seam of the plastic bag. This will make it easier to fold and create a more uniform fabric in the end. Step 4: Fold the plastic bag in half Take one side of the plastic bag and fold it over to meet the other side. Press down on the fold to create a smooth edge. Step 5: Fold the plastic bag into a rectangular shape Starting from one edge of the plastic bag, fold it over about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) towards the other edge. Continue to fold the bag in this manner, creating a rectangular, accordion-like shape. Step 6: Iron the folded plastic bag (optional) Place a piece of parchment paper (or non-stick baking paper) both under and on top of the folded plastic bag to prevent melting. Use the iron on a low heat setting and gently press down on the parchment-covered plastic bag to slightly melt the layers together. Be cautious not to use too much heat, as this can cause the plastic to completely melt and stick to the parchment paper. This step is optional, but it helps to create a stronger, more fabric-like material. Step 7: Unfold the plastic bag Once the plastic bag has cooled down, carefully unfold it. You should now have a flat, durable, fabric-like material made from the plastic shopping bag. These steps can be repeated with multiple plastic bags to create a larger piece of fabric, which can then be sewn or glued together as needed. Remember that working with hot materials and cutting tools can be dangerous, so always exercise caution and work in a well-ventilated area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The text indicates that the company's headquarters, located on an 11th floor, is crowded with young employees, described as \\"twentysomethings in jeans,\\" reflecting the casual, and likely fast-paced, millennial-driven work environment typically found in technology companies or startups. The employees at Varsity Group Inc are working in cramped conditions, as evidenced by the phrase \\"doubled and tripled up in small offices,\\" which means multiple people are sharing one office space, normally designed for just one or two individuals. It projects a picture of a thoroughly occupied and bustling office space where the company is possibly trying to accommodate an expanding workforce due to an increase in its operations. One of the striking details mentioned is about a rear wall that is about to be demolished to create more room. This suggests a physical expansion is imminently happening at the company's existing headquarters, probably triggered by the growing number of employees or the requirement of additional operational areas. The last line of the excerpt indicates that for the first time in four years, the e-commerce firm is \\"bursting at the seams\\", a metaphor typically used to convey that something in its current state is unable to accommodate its increasing size or volume.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"How to view older messages on Kik: Kik is a popular messaging app that allows you to send and receive messages instantly. While it doesn't have a built-in feature to view older messages, you can still follow these steps to access and read older messages in a conversation: 1. Open the Kik app on your device and sign in using your credentials. 2. Locate the chat where you want to view older messages and tap on it to open the conversation. 3. To view older messages, simply scroll up within the chat until the point you want to see. If the conversation has been ongoing for quite some time, the scrolling may take a while. 4. If you are using Kik on a smartphone, you might be able to use the search function to find specific keywords or phrases within the conversation. Tap the chat name at the top of the screen to access chat settings or options and then choose the Search feature if available. However, it is important to note that not all devices and Kik app versions might have this functionality. Now, addressing the second question about reading deleted messages on Kik: No, once a message is deleted in Kik, it cannot be retrieved or read again. Kik doesn't store messages on their servers and messages are stored on your device only. When you delete a message or a conversation, it is permanently removed from your device and cannot be restored. This means that you will not be able to read the deleted messages again. In conclusion, the two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is about viewing older messages that are still present in the chat, while the second question is about reading messages that have been deleted from the chat. Although both involve accessing messages in Kik, the processes and outcomes are different – older messages can still be viewed by scrolling up in the chat, while deleted messages cannot be recovered or read again."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Q: In this task, you are given inputs 'i', 'j', and A, where 'i' and 'j' are integers and A is a list. A list is shown by two brackets and comma-separated numbers and characters inside, like ['1', '12', 'l']. You need to concatenate all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element, and then reverse the resulting string. 'i' and 'j' will be non-negative, and will always have a value less than the length of A. 'i' will always be less than 'j'.

In Python, this can be done using slicing operation. Python list indexing starts from 0, so the range for slicing becomes [i:j+1] to include the jth element. The elements of A from index 1 to 16 are ['5853', '4805', '9907', 'v', 'X', '6495', 'R', '5311', 'm', '969', 'x', '4341', '6733', 'y', '623', 'z']. Then, concatenate these elements.

The next step is to reverse this string. Strings in Python can be reversed using slicing with a step of -1. When applied to our string, this will give 'z326y3371643x969m1135R5946Xv70994905853' as the final result.

Will foreign students studying in the USA be unwelcomed after Donald Trump is elected as president? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Possible answers: (A). no; (B). yes;","completion":"If Donald Trump were to win a future election and become president again, the effects on Indian students and other international students studying in the United States could depend on several factors. While it is impossible to predict the exact outcome, we can consider potential scenarios and changes based on his policies and statements during his previous term in the office. Some of the potential effects of a Trump presidency on Indian students studying in the US might include: 1. Changes in visa regulations: During his previous term, President Trump took actions to change visa regulations, which affected Indian students and IT professionals. For instance, the suspension of premium processing for H-1B visas, increased scrutiny of visa applications, and proposed changes to the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program might have made it more challenging for Indian students to obtain and maintain visas, as well as gain employment in the US after completing their studies. If Trump were to get re-elected, it is possible that further changes to visa regulations could be introduced, potentially limiting the opportunities for Indian students and international students in general. 2. Reduced funding for higher education and research: President Trump's previous administration proposed cuts to several federal programs, impacting higher education and research in different fields. If Trump’s policies emphasize reduced funding for higher education and research, it might affect the opportunities available for Indian students in their respective fields of study. 3. Changes to work-study programs and internships: With President Trump's administration emphasizing the prioritization of American workers, policies and regulations may be introduced that limit access for international students to internships and work-study programs. 4. Impact on overall perception: While it's important not to generalize, some Indian students might feel unwelcome or face a more challenging environment due to the rhetoric and policies advocated by President Trump and his administration. This may include concerns about racism, discrimination, and cultural misunderstanding by certain sections of the society. Regarding the multi-choice problem, the answer is (B). yes; since both questions revolve around the potential impact of a Trump presidency on international students, specifically focusing on Indian students. While the first question asks about the potential effects on Indian students studying in the United States, the second question narrows down the focus to whether international students would feel unwelcome in the country. However, both questions essentially address the same broader concern of how a Trump presidency might affect international students, and the implications for their experience in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the text provided, Rana amurensis, also known as the Khabarovsk frog, Siberian wood frog, Heilongjiang brown frog, or Amur brown frog, is a species of true frog that can be found in various regions of northern Asia. One of these regions is western Siberia, corroborating the statement that Rana amurensis can be found in Siberia. Additionally, Rana amurensis can also be found in northeastern China, northeastern Mongolia, the northern Korean Peninsula, and on Sakhalin Island. Previously, the \\"Rana coreana\\" was considered a subspecies of Rana amurensis, which further emphasizes the extensive range of this species. These frogs are adapted to living in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and mountain regions. They are known for their ability to tolerate cold temperatures, which is a crucial characteristic for thriving in the cold climate of Siberia. The Siberian wood frog gets its name from the characteristic habitat it occupies, which may include areas with dense tree cover. They are known to breed in shallow, temporary pools of water created by snowmelt in the springtime. Regarding their diet, Rana amurensis primarily feeds on various invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and small mollusks. They play a vital role in controlling the populations of these invertebrates within their ecosystems, making them an essential part of the food chain. In turn, this species serves as a food source for predators like birds and larger mammals. Although they are a relatively widespread and adaptable species, Rana amurensis populations are subject to disturbances caused by habitat destruction and pollution. Climate change could also potentially impact their distribution and abundance.

Context: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. Question: Why did Trump meet with Trudeau? Options: - It was the annual summit in Canada - they went to a concert together - it was election day in Canada - not enough information","completion":"Trump met with Trudeau because it was the annual summit in Canada."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Which storm in the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season reached the highest recorded wind speed? Passage:Tropical Storm Fay was a strong and unusual tropical storm that moved erratically across the state of Florida and the Caribbean Sea. The sixth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay formed from a vigorous tropical wave on August 15 over the Dominican Republic. It passed over the island of Hispaniola, into the Gulf of Gonâve, across the island of Cuba, and made landfall on the Florida Keys late in the afternoon of August 18 before veering into the Gulf of Mexico. It again made landfall near Naples, Florida, in the early hours of August 19 and progressed northeast through the Florida peninsula, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Melbourne on August 20. Extensive flooding took place in parts of Florida as a result of its slow movement. On August 21, it made landfall again near New Smyrna Beach, Florida, moving due west across the Panhandle, crossing Gainesville and Panama City, Florida. As it zigzagged from water to land, it became the first storm in recorded history to make landfall in Florida four times. Thirty-six deaths were blamed on Fay. The storm also resulted in one of the most prolific tropical cyclone related tornado outbreaks on record. A total of 81 tornadoes touched down across five states, three of which were rated as EF2. Damage from Fay was heavy, estimated at 560 million.","completion":"The sixth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay formed from a vigorous tropical wave on August 15 over the Dominican Republic."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Pick the length and style the best suits your personal aesthetic. Blusher: This shoulder length veil rests just below the shoulders of the bride. The standard length of the blusher is 22 inches long. Brides that want a double-tier veil often pair the blusher with a longer veil. Elbow length veil: This 25 inch veil rests at the bride’s elbow. Waist length veil: The bottom of this 30 inch veil sits at the bride’s waist. Mid-hip length veil: The mid-hip veil is 33 inches long. Hip length veil: The hip length veil reaches the bottom of the bride’s hips. Its standard length is 36 inches. Fingertip veil: This veil brushes the tips of the bride’s fingers. Its standard length is 45 inches. Waltz veil: This veil hits the bride just above the back of the knees. Its standard length is 54 inches. Ankle veil: The ankle veil sits just above the floor. Its standard length is 70 inches. Chapel veil: This veil has a short train. Its standard length is 90 inches. Cathedral veil: The Cathedral veil has a grander train than the chapel veil. Its standard length is 108 inches. The benefit of making your own veil is that you can easily customize the length to match the proportions of your body. Retrieve a measuring tape and ask a friend to assist you. Place and hold one end of the measuring tape where you intend to insert the clip or comb. Run the measuring tape down your back until it reaches the appropriate length (to shoulders, elbows, waist, mid-hips, hips, fingertips, top of your knees, ankles, 20 inches beyond your ankles, or 38 inches beyond your ankles). Write down the measurement. If you have decided to create a two-tier veil, drop veil, or full veil, you will need to make an additional measurement. Place the top of the measuring tape in the location you intend to insert the clip or comb. Run the measuring tape over the crown of your head, down the front of your face, to your collarbone. Write down this measurement. If you are creating a single tier veil, you will need to purchase fabric that is as long or slightly longer than the measurement you wrote down. If you are creating a two-tier, drop, or full veil, add the first measurement to the second measurement. You will need to purchase fabric that is as long or slightly longer than the the sum of the two measurements.","completion":"The article is about how to choose and measure for different types of veils, like blusher, elbow length, waist length, and others, and how to make your own veil to match your body proportions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas. contains an answer for the question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn?, what is it ?

Experiment with distance. Move quickly. Be choosy about locations.","completion":"Sure, sweetie! Lets imagine we're going on a fun learning adventure, like when we're learning to draw beautiful colors, right? But this time, instead of crayons we're going to use something called spray paint cans. 1. **Practice First**: You know how when you wanted to ride your bike, you first had to practice with training wheels? Spray painting is similar. You first need to practice how to use the can. You can practice spraying on an old cardboard or any surface you don't care much about. Just like when you learned to write your name, the more you practice, the better you'll get! 2. **Stretch**: Just like when we wake up and stretch our bodies so we feel really good for the day, stretching before spray painting is very important too. This helps you to get ready to make big movements with your arm and body, just like a grand dance. 3. **Shake Your Can**: Think of the can as a toy maraca. You know how you shake a maraca to make the sound? Well, you need to do the same thing with the can before spraying it. This mixes all the color inside so you get bright, pretty colors on your canvas! 4. **Put Your Spraying Cap On Well Away from Your Canvas**: Understand this like when you want to eat soup. It's too hot right after you make it, so you put it a little bit away to cool down. In the same way, you need to put the spraying cap on the can while you're away from the canvas to avoid any accidental spills. 5. **Experiment with Distance**: Remember how we play with toy cars? If we keep them close, they seem very big, and if we take them far, they seem very small. The same rule applies here. If you spray from close, the color will be very thick, and if you spray from far, the color will be very light. 6. **Move Quickly**: Move your arm quickly while you spray, just like when we play tag, you have to run quickly, otherwise, someone might tag you. If you move slowly with the spray, it might drip and ruin your painting. 7. **Be Choosy About Locations**: This is like when you find the perfect spot to build your sand castle at the beach. Painting with spray cans can be messy, so it's important to choose the right place where it will not spoil the surroundings. Plus, it should be a safe place where you won't get into trouble! That, my dear, is how to create art with sprays. Now go ahead and have fun painting, just remember to always have an adult with you when you spray paint!"},{"prompt":"Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: be calm B: be shocked C: be happy A:","completion":"Based on the context, the most appropriate answer to the question of what will happen to Jesse is B: be shocked. When someone learns about a big secret that has been kept from them, it is reasonable to expect that they will experience a range of emotions - most likely starting with shock as they process this new information. Since the secret was being kept from Jesse, they might feel surprised and even betrayed, depending on the nature of the secret. While answer A: be calm is a possible reaction, it is not as likely as being shocked, especially if the secret is indeed a significant one. People may eventually become calm after processing the news, but their initial reaction is more likely to be shock. Answer C: be happy may not be an appropriate response either, as the context indicates that the secret has been kept from Jesse, suggesting it could be something that might not bring happiness to them. Additionally, happiness as the primary reaction depends heavily on the content of the secret and the relationship between Robin and Jesse.

Possible answers: -negative -positive","completion":"The review provided was given negatively. There are several indicators within the review's content that firmly establish this assessment. First, the reviewer uses direct, unambiguous language to express their dissatisfaction, such as \\"stay away from the Aliante!!!!\\", where the exclamation marks amplify the intensity of the negative sentiment. Second, the reviewer makes extensive use of negative adjectives and descriptions to characterize the hotel, its staff, and their overall experience. They state that \\"most of the people at the hotel are not very nice or helpful,\\" which is a clear expression of dissatisfaction. Additionally, the reviewer explicitly characterizes their experience at the casino as \\"the worst time we have ever had in a casino,\\" thereby leaving no room for positive interpretation. They further explain that the casino personnel were \\"the rudest\\" and lacked \\"personality,\\" both of which are vehemently negative statements. Moreover, the attempt to justify the host venue's low visitor turnout (\\"I now know why the casino was empty on Friday and Saturday night\\") indicates that the reviewer's bad experience does not seem to be an isolated incidence, rather a recurring issue that likely affects the experience of other visitors, too. Finally, even when describing the pleasant aspects of the hotel—i.e., \\"the hotel is nice and the rooms are nice\\"—the reviewer does so only as a precursor to a deluge of negative comments, thus reducing the impact of any positivity in these observations. The overall tone of the review is therefore overwhelmingly negative, culminating in the recommendation to avoid the hotel entirely. Therefore, considering the aforementioned points, it is clear that this review is negative."},{"prompt":"Given an trivia question precisely answer the question with a word/phrase/name.

However, considering that we have to choose one sentiment between negative and positive, it may be reasonable to lean towards describing the sentiment as (b). positive. There are several reasons for this interpretation. Firstly, the text does not explicitly convey any negative emotions or complaints about going to work. It simply states that the individual is about to start their work. If the author had included any negative emotions, we could have considered the sentiment as negative, but that's not the case here. Secondly, one could argue that by sharing this information, the author is engaging with their followers and seems to be looking forward to their day. It is common for people to share their plans or daily routines on social media, even if they are mundane. This type of sharing can be considered a positive way to connect with others.

Your job is to generate the answer to the question by using the information provided. If there is no clear answer obtainable, output 'none'. Passage: Dissatisfied with the Interim decreed by Charles V at the 1548 Diet of Augsburg, the insurgents were full of resolution to defend Protestantism and–not least–their autonomy against the Imperial central authority. They agreed to establish contacts with the Catholic French king Henry II, disregarding his oppression of the Protestant Huguenots. In autumn Henry declared war against Charles V and prepared to march against the Empire up to the Rhine River. On 15 January 1552, he signed the Treaty of Chambord with Maurice of Saxony and his Protestant allies, whereby the French conquests were legitimised ahead of time. The princes acknowledged the king's lordship as \\"Vicar of the Empire\\" over the Imperial cities of Metz, Toul and Verdun, as well as Cambrai \\"and other towns of the Empire that do not speak German\\". The insurgents in turn received subsidies and military assistance from the French, their troops moved into the Habsburg hereditary lands and laid siege to the emperor at Innsbruck, while his brother Ferdinand I entered into negotiations that led to the revocation of the Augsburg Interim by the 1552 Peace of Passau. Link Information: On 15 January 1552, he signed the Treaty of Chambord with Maurice of Saxony and his Protestant allies Question: How much time had passed between Henry II's declaration of war against Charles V and the signing of the Treaty of Chambord?","completion":"The task is asking for a chronological analysis of the events mentioned in the given passage. The guidelines provided involve understanding the timeline mentioned in the passage and the linked information. Specifically, the task aims at understanding the time difference between two significant events. Step 1: Read the passage carefully. Identify the two events mentioned in the question - 'Henry II's declaration of war against Charles V' and 'the signing of the Treaty of Chambord'. Step 2: Highlight the occurrences of these events in the passage. Henry II declares war in the line: \\"In autumn Henry declared war against Charles V...\\" and the signing of the Treaty of Chambord is mentioned in the line: \\"On 15 January 1552, he signed the Treaty of Chambord...\\" Step 3: Understand the timeline. Henry II declared war in 'Autumn'. The actual year is not given, but considering that the declaration of war and the signing of the Treaty of Chambord both took place before the Peace of Passau in 1552, we can assume it was in the previous year, 1551. The signing of Treaty of Chambord clearly took place on 15 January 1552. Step 4: Calculate the time difference. Considering autumn as roughly starting in September, the time between Henry's declaration of war in Autumn (let's say September for estimation) 1551 and the treaty signing on 15 January 1552 would be about 4 months. So, the answer to the question \\"How much time had passed between Henry II's declaration of war against Charles V and the signing of the Treaty of Chambord?\\" would be approximately 4 months. This is assuming that he declared the war in the beginning of autumn. The exact time would depend on when during the autumn the declaration was made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When one of the four grifters is found shot to death, the other three learn that the latest money they stole actually belonged to a local L.A. crime lord called The King (Dustin Hoffman). Jake meets The King, who proposes that the grifters now go to work for him and steal money from Morgan Price, a rival who now owns a bank. The sociopathic King leaves them little choice in the matter.Having no options, Jake gets to work on developing a new con; he enlists the aid of his two remaining partners, Gordo and Miles, and also convinces an independent con artist named Lilly (Rachel Weisz) to round out their foursome. Unfortunately, The King, a wiry, manic man who suffers from ADHD, demands that one of his men, Lupus, also work on the con. The con involves bribing a vice president at the bank into wiring money offshore. The plan hits a major snag when Special Agent Gunther Butan (Andy Garcia) shows up in L.A., looking to finally bust Jake, whom he has followed for years. Agent Butan quickly forces two corrupt LAPD detectives into switching their allegiance from Jake to him.After hearing about Butan's arrival in town, a nervous Jake pulls the plug on the whole con, and screams at Lilly - making her walk out on the group. Lupus gets Jake to reconsider nixing the con, hinting that The King will torture and kill the grifters if the plan falls short. The con is back on, though now without Lilly's help. The plan starts smoothly enough, and the bribed bank VP wires the money to Gordo in Belize. Gordo brings the money to Ontario Airport, but he is met at the airport by both Agent Butan as well as The King and his men, as both sides are after the 5 million in a duffle bag.

Q: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not. The claim asks if the posts are historical or hypothetical. The posts are \\"HISTORICAL\\" when the author has already done something and they are \\"HYPOTHETICAL\\" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : So to give some background, I'm a senior in high school. I have a government class and my teacher got some new curriculum called Generation Citizen. The whole point of it is to have students vote to work on a local issue and then work towards talking to local politicians and people in power to make some sort of change happen. So. he divided us into groups a while and had us come up with an issue, then we would present each issue the groups came up with, and then collectively voted on that as a whole. In the end, we were about to do something regarding veterans, I don't really remember for sure what is was. But, as the very last group is going, this one student from their group goes up to the front of the class, and gives a whole testimony about how he is homeless. After his speech, most of the votes go to helping \\"youth homelessness\\". Let me drop some statistics here. In my school district in California, which has been known to have homeless problems, there is an estimated 3-5% of homeless students in my school district. I was thinking the whole time, \\"There's no way a tiny high school class is going to solve youth homelessness.\\" I did more research and found that a lot of millions of dollars have gone into helping with this issue along with multiple organizations in our area that are working on the issue 24/7. So, there's no way we can really solve the whole issue. Fast forward to the past 2-3 weeks. This student doesn't even show up to class anymore, and I mention this to other people and they felt that it's dumb that he came, changed a bunch of votes, and dipped. It's like he didn't even show up to his own pity party. So I'm assuming now that a lot of the people don't want to work on this issue anymore and probably want to change it. I recommended to my teacher that we do something that affects all students in the entire school district which was open campus. This means that any student can leave campus to go get food and as long as they come back before lunch ends, you wouldn't be in any trouble. But people already sneak out to get food anyways. My teacher's response was, \\"If we let students go during lunch to buy their own food, then people who can't afford to get food will feel bad or feel left out.\\" I responded with the fact that we have vending machines at our school, so wouldn't someone who couldn't afford something from the vending machine feel the same way? So it wouldn't even be different from that. The whole point of this is that we don't even want to work on this issue, and the only real change that my teacher made to this was to have a plan to create a \\"Youth Task Force for Homeless Youth\\" because who can relate to youth better than the youth. But nobody even wants to be a part of the task force. We feel a little forced to work on this issue now even though people voted how they wanted to after being swayed by the homeless student's speech. I didn't vote for it, but the majority of people did, and I'm sure they regret it. At this point, we collectively do not care about working on our issue as much anymore, and would rather do something else. &amp;#x200B; In conclusion...AITA for not caring about this issue and trying to protest it?

The thing that you need to consider if you are looking for the same is that you really need to find the proper synergy between BOTH stylus and App. Especially when you are considering these active stylii that pair with the app, you need the app to support the sdk provided by the stylii manufacturer.<br /><br />Last year I settled on this Jot Script and the Goodnotes app. I primarily value a pairing that allows me to use it like a journal, and this pair works brilliantly. Initially the offset and lag of the Script did not allow for writing full screen with any precision, but over time both the SDK and the app have developed and now it works passably for full-screen note-taking, especially with the latest iOS update which supports the best palm rejection I have yet seen. Using the zoom box for writing is my preferred mode (even when I have a precise stylus - I actually think this is an improvement of pen and paper) and the Script works great for this. I have found that the currently best solution is to either pair the stylus with Goodnotes and use the Goodnotes Palm Rejection (which makes for more precision at the tip) or to just not pair the stylus at all (which I find has good enough precision and a bit less lag).<br /><br />This is still not a perfect device, but overall it is the best of the many options I have tried.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (sometimes also spelled Khalid Shaikh Mohammed; among at least fifty pseudonyms; born March 1, 1964) is an Islamist militant held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp under terrorism-related charges. He was named as \\"the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks\\" in the 9/11 Commission Report. Sheikh Mohammed was a member of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization, leading al-Qaeda's propaganda operations from around 1999 until late 2001. He confessed to FBI and CIA agents to a role in many of the most significant terrorist plots over the last twenty years, but his interrogators' use of enhanced interrogation techniques has caused some to question certain aspects of his confessions. By the time the Bojinka plot was discovered, Mohammed had returned to Qatar and his job as a project engineer at the country's Ministry of Electricity and Water. He traveled in 1995 to Sudan, Yemen, Malaysia, and Brazil to visit elements of the worldwide jihadist community, although no evidence connects him to specific terrorist actions in any of those locations. On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with Osama Bin Laden, who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader Hassan al-Turabi. After the US asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to Afghanistan, where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. Later that year, he formed a working relationship with Bin Laden, who had settled there. Bin Laden and his colleagues relocated their operations to Afghanistan at this time. Abu Hafs al-Masri/Mohammed Atef, bin Laden's chief of operations, arranged a meeting between bin Laden and Mohammed in Tora Bora sometime in mid-1996, in which Mohammed outlined a plan that would eventually become the quadruple hijackings of 2001. Bin Laden urged Mohammed to become a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda, but he continued to refuse such a commitment until around early 1999, after the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Mohammed moved his family from Iran to Karachi, Pakistan, in 1997. That year, he tried unsuccessfully to join mujahideen leader Ibn al-Khattab in Chechnya, another area of special interest to Mohammed. Unable to travel to Chechnya, he returned to Afghanistan. He ultimately accepted bin Laden's invitation to move to Kandahar and join al-Qaeda as a full-fledged member. Eventually, he became leader of Al Qaeda's media committee. Did Khalid work with anyone else in his planning?","completion":"Yes, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed did not single-handedly plan and execute the acts of terrorism credited to him. He worked with numerous other individuals as part of the larger Al-Qaeda organization, an international terrorist group founded by Osama bin Laden. Mohammed was a central figure in Al-Qaeda, working closely with Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, who were the leaders of the organization. Together, they orchestrated several large-scale terrorist attacks, including the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the specific instance of the 9/11 attacks, Mohammed worked with a group of individuals who eventually carried out the operation. This group included the 19 hijackers who took control of the four airplanes used in these attacks. Among these hijackers were Mohammed Atta, the ringleader, and the pilots Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Hani Hanjour. Furthermore, during the early planning stages of the 9/11 attacks, Mohammed collaborated with Riduan Isamuddin, commonly known as Hambali, who was a senior member of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist organization with links to Al-Qaeda. Abu Hafs al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Atef, was another crucial figure in Mohammed's network. Atef was said to have arranged the pivotal meeting in mid-1996 between Bin Laden and Mohammed, in which Mohammed first proposed what would eventually become the 9/11 plan. Also worth noting is Ramzi Yousef, another Al-Qaeda operative, who, along with Mohammed, hatched the failed Bojinka plot to simultaneously detonate bombs on twelve U.S. airliners over the Pacific Ocean in 1995. Yousef is also believed to be a nephew of Mohammed. Beyond these specific individuals, Mohammed was supported by a broader network of Al-Qaeda operatives who provided logistics, funding, training, and other supports. As part of a well-structured organization like Al-Qaeda, he was able to rely on a wide array of resources and individuals in his planning and operational work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s opening statement today, a fiery, scorched-earth speech that may well have salvaged his bid for the Supreme Court, was not only aimed at the Senate Judiciary Committee. It carried an even bigger goal: to keep President Donald Trump from losing faith in his nomination. Kavanaugh was being urged by some — including old friends from Bush world — to take a softer approach today. But in the end, he tuned out the advice, and sat down to write a speech with a sole aide. An overarching goal: please Trump and, in turn, circle the conservative wagons behind him, an official close to the process said. Two White House officials said that while the President never seriously considered asking Kavanaugh to withdraw, he did discuss the idea — publicly and privately — that he would quickly announce another nominee and use the rejection of Kavanaugh to rally conservatives in the mid-term elections. It didn’t come to that, but there were “incredibly tense moments” in the White House after Christine Blasey Ford finished her testimony. A White House official said the president found Ford “compelling” and “very credible” and had serious questions about how Kavanaugh would perform. “He didn’t disappoint. He exceeded every expectation,” a White House official said. The President was publicly silent throughout the day, but his hand was guiding nearly every pivotal move – from Sen. Lindsey Graham’s boisterous speech to the decision to shut down the Republican-selected special prosecutor. ||||| READ: Christine Blasey Ford's Opening Statement For Senate Hearing Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP Christine Blasey Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school in the early 1980s. On Thursday the psychology professor is testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Read her opening statement below. Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, Members of the Committee. My name is Christine Blasey Ford. I am a Professor of Psychology at Palo Alto University and a Research Psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina and earned my degree in Experimental Psychology in 1988. I received a Master's degree in 1991 in Clinical Psychology from Pepperdine University. In 1996, I received a PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Southern California. I earned a Master's degree in Epidemiology from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2009. I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children. I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. I have described the events publicly before. I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley. I understand and appreciate the importance of your hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had on my life and on my family. I grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. I attended the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, from 1980 to 1984. Holton-Arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901. During my time at the school, girls at Holton-Arms frequently met and became friendly with boys from all-boys schools in the area, including Landon School, Georgetown Prep, Gonzaga High School, country clubs, and other places where kids and their families socialized. This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me. In my freshman and sophomore school years, when I was 14 and 15 years old, my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends for a short period of time. I had been friendly with a classmate of Brett's for a short time during my freshman year, and it was through that connection that I attended a number of parties that Brett also attended. We did not know each other well, but I knew him and he knew me. In the summer of 1982, like most summers, I spent almost every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase, Maryland swimming and practicing diving. One evening that summer, after a day of swimming at the club, I attended a small gathering at a house in the Chevy Chase/Bethesda area. There were four boys I remember being there: Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth, and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I remember my friend Leland Ingham attending. I do not remember all of the details of how that gathering came together, but like many that summer, it was almost surely a spur of the moment gathering. I truly wish I could provide detailed answers to all of the questions that have been and will be asked about how I got to the party, where it took place, and so forth. I don't have all the answers, and I don't remember as much as I would like to. But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult. When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom. I couldn't see who pushed me. Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music already playing in the bedroom. It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room. I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Mark was urging Brett on, although at times he told Brett to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not. During this assault, Mark came over and jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me. The last time he did this, we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me. I was able to get up and run out of the room. Directly across from the bedroom was a small bathroom. I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door. I heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs, pin-balling off the walls on the way down. I waited and when I did not hear them come back up the stairs, I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me. Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened. Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience. I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault. I had never told the details to anyone until May 2012, during a couples counseling session. The reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed an extensive remodel of our home, and I insisted on a second front door, an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand. In explaining why I wanted to have a second front door, I described the assault in detail. I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background. My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh. After that May 2012 therapy session, I did my best to suppress memories of the assault because recounting the details caused me to relive the experience, and caused panic attacks and anxiety. Occasionally I would discuss the assault in individual therapy, but talking about it caused me to relive the trauma, so I tried not to think about it or discuss it. But over the years, I went through periods where I thought about Brett's attack. I confided in some close friends that I had an experience with sexual assault. Occasionally I stated that my assailant was a prominent lawyer or judge but I did not use his name. I do not recall each person I spoke to about Brett's assault, and some friends have reminded me of these conversations since the publication of The Washington Post story on September 16, 2018. But until July 2018, I had never named Mr. Kavanaugh as my attacker outside of therapy. This all changed in early July 2018. I saw press reports stating that Brett Kavanaugh was on the \\"short list\\" of potential Supreme Court nominees. I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh's conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault. On July 6, 2018, I had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the President as soon as possible before a nominee was selected. I called my congressional representative and let her receptionist know that someone on the President's shortlist had attacked me. I also sent a message to The Washington Post's confidential tip line. I did not use my name, but I provided the names of Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. I stated that Mr. Kavanaugh had assaulted me in the 1980s in Maryland. This was an extremely hard thing for me to do, but I felt I couldn't NOT do it. Over the next two days, I told a couple of close friends on the beach in California that Mr. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted me. I was conflicted about whether to speak out. On July 9, 2018, I received a call from the office of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo after Mr. Kavanaugh had become the nominee. I met with her staff on July 11 and with her on July 13, describing the assault and discussing my fear about coming forward. Later, we discussed the possibility of sending a letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, who is one of my state's Senators, describing what occurred. My understanding is that Representative Eshoo's office delivered a copy of my letter to Senator Feinstein's office on July 30, 2018. The letter included my name, but requested that the letter be kept confidential. My hope was that providing the information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider Mr. Kavanaugh's serious misconduct without having to make myself, my family, or anyone's family vulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy we have faced since my name became public. In a letter on August 31, 2018, Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my consent. I greatly appreciated this commitment. All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public. As the hearing date got closer, I struggled with a terrible choice: Do I share the facts with the Senate and put myself and my family in the public spotlight? Or do I preserve our privacy and allow the Senate to make its decision on Mr. Kavanaugh's nomination without knowing the full truth about his past behavior? I agonized daily with this decision throughout August and early September 2018. The sense of duty that motivated me to reach out confidentially to The Washington Post, Representative Eshoo's office, and Senator Feinstein's office was always there, but my fears of the consequences of speaking out started to increase. During August 2018, the press reported that Mr. Kavanaugh's confirmation was virtually certain. His allies painted him as a champion of women's rights and empowerment. I believed that if I came forward, my voice would be drowned out by a chorus of powerful supporters. By the time of the confirmation hearings, I had resigned myself to remaining quiet and letting the Committee and the Senate make their decision without knowing what Mr. Kavanaugh had done to me. Once the press started reporting on the existence of the letter I had sent to Senator Feinstein, I faced mounting pressure. Reporters appeared at my home and at my job demanding information about this letter, including in the presence of my graduate students. They called my boss and coworkers and left me many messages, making it clear that my name would inevitably be released to the media. I decided to speak out publicly to a journalist who had responded to the tip I had sent to The Washington Post and who had gained my trust. It was important to me to describe the details of the assault in my own words. Since September 16, the date of The Washington Post story, I have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country. Thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their own experiences with me and have thanked me for coming forward. We have received tremendous support from friends and our community. At the same time, my greatest fears have been realized – and the reality has been far worse than what I expected. My family and I have been the target of constant harassment and death threats. I have been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable. These messages, while far fewer than the expressions of support, have been terrifying to receive and have rocked me to my core. People have posted my personal information on the internet. This has resulted in additional emails, calls, and threats. My family and I were forced to move out of our home. Since September 16, my family and I have been living in various secure locales, with guards. This past Tuesday evening, my work email account was hacked and messages were sent out supposedly recanting my description of the sexual assault. Apart from the assault itself, these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life. I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world, and have seen my life picked apart by people on television, in the media, and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me. I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one's pawn. My motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaugh's actions have damaged my life, so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed. It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the truth. I understand that the Majority has hired a professional prosecutor to ask me some questions, and I am committed to doing my very best to answer them. At the same time, because the Committee Members will be judging my credibility, I hope to be able to engage directly with each of you. At this point, I will do my best to answer your questions. ||||| READ: Brett Kavanaugh's Opening Statement For Senate Hearing Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images On Thursday, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on a sexual assault allegation by Christine Blasey Ford, who is also testifying. Read Kavanaugh's opening statement below, submitted to the panel on Wednesday. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee: Eleven days ago, Dr. Ford publicly accused me of committing a serious wrong more than 36 years ago when we were both in high school. I denied the allegation immediately, unequivocally, and categorically. The next day, I told this Committee that I wanted to testify as soon as possible, under oath, to clear my name. Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something—anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious—that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple. They debase our public discourse. And the consequences extend beyond any one nomination. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination—if allowed to succeed—will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country. As I told this Committee the last time I appeared before you, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I am and will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. This effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. I am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have never sexually assaulted anyone—not in high school, not in college, not ever. Sexual assault is horrific. It is morally wrong. It is illegal. It is contrary to my religious faith. And it contradicts the core promise of this Nation that all people are created equal and entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Allegations of sexual assault must be taken seriously. Those who make allegations deserve to be heard. The subject of allegations also deserves to be heard. Due process is a foundation of the American rule of law. Dr. Ford's allegation dates back more than 36 years, to a party that she says occurred during our time in high school. I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church, and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But that's not why we are here today. What I've been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes. The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life. The record of my life, from my days in grade school through the present day, shows that I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women. I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. I am innocent of this charge. |||||Summary:","completion":"In his opening statement during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge Brett Kavanaugh delivered a strong and passionate speech in defense of himself and his nomination. The statement served not only to address the committee but also to reassure President Donald Trump and solidify conservative support for his Supreme Court nomination.

After Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, there were concerns in the White House over Kavanaugh's performance, but after hearing his opening statement, they felt that he exceeded their expectations. Throughout the entire process, President Trump's hand guided key decisions and actions, keeping a close eye on the proceedings.

An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues.

Yet many individuals grapple with hostile experiences in these areas. Harassment - the unwelcome conduct based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information– is an unfortunate reality that is faced by many people globally. The first step in dealing with harassment – and incidentally, one of the most vital – is to ask if you welcomed the conduct. This might seem like an obvious point, but it's crucial to quickly identify and accept that if the action makes you feel uncomfortable, violated, or negatively impacted, it is unwelcome. Consciously acknowledging this fact is the preliminary step in your journey against harassment. Next, it is essential to analyze the severity of the behavior. The weight of the harassment often determines the subsequent course of action. For instance, a single, minor instance might warrant a conversation with the offender while repeated or extreme actions may necessitate stronger measures, such as involving legal authorities or higher-ups in the organization. Reflecting on experience's gravity is thus the second step in responding to harassment. Moreover, the frequency of the harassment is another quintessential variable to consider. Is the incident a one-time occurrence or a repetitive act? Frequent, continual harassment can have a more damaging impact on psychological health and overall wellbeing. This step of checking the frequency helps establish the depth of the situation and aids in formulating a response. Then, seek insight from your peers or those surrounding you. Check if others also find the behavior off-putting. This is not about seeking validation for your feelings but more about gaining a broader perspective of the situation. Sometimes, the offender might be unaware of the negative impact of their behavior until multiple individuals express their discomfort. This step might also lead to a collective effort to combat such behavior. After accumulating a comprehensive understanding of the issue, speaking with a lawyer can be a wise move. Depending on the severity and frequency of the incidents, consulting a professional on your legal rights can provide valuable reassurance. They will advise you on how to document instances, possible retaliation laws, and potential actions for resolution, making you more equipped to deal with the situation. Finally, it is time to take the next steps. Armed with knowledge, legal advice, and an assessment of the severity and frequency of the incidents, you can decide on an action plan. This could involve reporting the behavior to your organization's HR department or even pressing charges if the offensive actions constitute a legal violation. Remember, everyone deserves to feel safe and respected in their surroundings. Taking these steps can help you move from a place of fear or discomfort to empowered action, a pivotal stride towards a healthier environment. Addressing harassment can be a daunting task. Yet, by asking if you welcomed the conduct, analyzing the behavior's severity, checking the frequency of the instances, seeking others' opinions, consulting with a lawyer and finally deciding on subsequent steps, you equip yourself to face this challenge with determination and courage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

American Yokota Air Base Answer:","completion":"Title: Saya and the Skies of Mystery Plot: Act 1: Saya, a distinguished and highly trained operative from a secret international intelligence agency, receives her next mission briefing. Her previous success in uncovering and dismantling a global criminal network has earned her accolades and trust. This time, her objective lies in investigating suspicious activities at the American Yokota Air Base in Japan. A series of mysterious events have taken place on the base, causing the government and military to become increasingly concerned. Classified information and advanced technology have gone missing, and a threatening cyber-attack that jeopardizes military operations originates from within the base. With no leads and even less time to resolve the situation, Saya is dispatched with the utmost urgency. Act 2: Saya infiltrates the American Yokota Air Base by posing as a technological consultant hired to enhance the base's cybersecurity. As she familiarizes herself with the facility and starts to build relationships with the personnel, she notices the strained dynamics between various high-ranking officers. Our protagonist quickly discovers a web of conspiracies and secrets that composes a far more complex and dangerous situation than she anticipated. As she delves deeper into the investigation, she uncovers a rogue faction within the military that seeks to leverage advanced military drone technology to conduct a coup in collaboration with an extremist organization. Simultaneously, Saya finds an unexpected ally in Jay, a skilled but disgraced aircraft mechanic, who previously lost his position due to his involvement in a controversial whistleblower case. Together, they must navigate through the intricate web of deception and betrayal and identify the mastermind behind the conspiracy. Act 3: As Saya and Jay's investigation progresses, they eventually trace the group's leader, an influential yet unsuspected figure within the military. Facing threats and danger at every turn, Saya and Jay demonstrate exceptional teamwork and cunning strategy, ultimately exposing the leader and thwarting the rogue faction's plans. In a final fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping sequence, the duo foils an attempt to hijack a newly developed, top-secret drone. Saya faces off against the rogue leader in hand-to-hand combat, while Jay prevents the drone from becoming a deadly weapon. Act 4: Saya delivers the evidence against the rogue faction to her superiors, ensuring the arrest and indictment of the guilty parties. As a result, the organization is dismantled, and peace is restored to the Yokota Air Base. Jay's reputation is cleared, and he is reinstated to his rightful position, gaining the respect of his peers once more for his bravery and dedication. Finally, Saya and Jay part ways - their friendship forged in a shared mission. Saya, now more experienced and determined than ever, discreetly moves on to her next assignment, eager to continue her pursuit of justice and protection around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Young Trent Burns (Sam Rockwell) is one of the lawn dogs who come to mow the lawns; he puts up with the hostility of the security guard and the local teenagers for the meager wages that support him in his rundown caravan in the woods off a deserted back road away from Camelot. Newly arrived is the Stockard family, whose 10 year old daughter, Devon (Mischa Barton), likes to be alone, so she can fantasise and what tough fantasies she has. Especially about a Russian witch who lives in the woods. Fearfully, scared the witch might cook and eat her, Devon searches the woods only to find Trent. Trent, reluctant to risk misunderstandings by paying attention to Devon, is nonetheless unable to resist Devons persistent calls for friendship. The friendship does indeed lead to trouble, fuelled by ignorance, prejudice and bigotry on the one hand, and cynicism on the other.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Echoes of Madness Genre: Horror, Thriller, Mystery Act 1: A Mundane Beginning The movie begins by introducing our five high school protagonists, who are in their senior year, living in a quiet, suburban town. Though they come from different walks of life, Jen (the honor student), Mark (the jock), Will (the artistic loner), Samantha (the social butterfly), and Linda (the class clown) have grown increasingly tired of their mundane everyday routines. One day, while discussing their shared boredom during their lunch break, Mark reveals that he overheard a few older students discussing an allegedly haunted abandoned psychiatric hospital, just on the outskirts of their town. Curiosity piqued, the group unanimously decides to cut class the following day and explore the mysterious decaying facility. Act 2: Unraveling the Dark Secrets Equipped with flashlights and makeshift tools, the group arrives at the enormous, decrepit hospital, which has been abandoned for almost two decades. As they venture deeper into the building, they find signs of illicit activities and graffiti littering the walls, adding an eerie and unwelcoming ambiance. The farther they get from the entrance, the more the group begins to feel the building's unnerving atmosphere. They uncover old patient records, reports of inhumane psychiatric practices, and newspaper clippings that detail violent riots, mysterious patient disappearances, and a series of unexplained deaths that led to the facility's eventual closing. Act 3: Disturbing Encounters As they explore, the friends start to notice subtle, inexplicable occurrences that unsettle their nerves. First, it's Mark's flashlight mysteriously dying, then Will seeing a fleeting shadow at the end of a long hallway. These strange occurrences escalate, with the group hearing faint whispers and catching glimpses of ghostly figures. Faced with these sinister supernatural events, the group becomes increasingly desperate to leave the hospital but realizes that they're lost and trapped. Panic begins to set in. During their frantic escape attempts, they stumble upon a hidden underground basement, where evidence of the hospital's darkest secrets - horrific experiments and the mistreatment of patients - are laid bare. Act 4: Unleashing the Dark Past As night falls, the supernatural phenomena intensify, and the group uncovers a shocking connection between the spirits they've encountered and the hospital's sinister past. The tortured patients, who were subjected to ghastly experiments, are seeking vengeance. It becomes clear that these vengeful spirits want to expose their suffering to the world and find closure by seeking justice against their tormentors - even if it means putting the group's lives at risk. As the protagonists face these tormented souls, they must confront their own insecurities, fears, and past traumas to gain the strength needed to survive this harrowing ordeal. Act 5: A Chilling Climax In their final attempt to escape the haunted hospital, the once-disparate group now works cohesively to face the malicious spirits; Jen uses her intelligence to decipher messages left by the spirits, Mark relies on his strength, Will employs his intuition, Samantha exhibits bravery, and Linda channels her humor. The movie reaches its climax as the group confronts the most powerful antagonistic spirit, the vengeful leader of the tormented souls. Overcoming their own traumas and insecurities, the group manages to strike a deal with the spirit; the friends vow to share the stories of the hospital's dark past and tortured patients, seeking justice and bringing the long-lost truth to light. With the promise made, the spirit releases the group, leaving them battered but forever bonded. They make their way back to the town, their lives irrevocably changed by this harrowing experience. As the final credits roll, the audience senses that the group won't abandon their promise to the spirits, and the fight for justice is just beginning. \\"Echoes of Madness\\" would be a chilling, thought-provoking examination of human resilience, the power of friendship, and the importance of uncovering dark truths to expose injustices. It would keep audiences at the edge of their seats, draw attention to the stigma surrounding mental health, and garner a cult following among fans of the horror genre."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia.

Gradually, it became evident that Dennis was struggling with both feelings of betrayal and regret for letting go of someone he had once deeply cared for. In his attempt to sabotage Joel and his ex-girlfriend's budding romance, Dennis resorted to various manipulative tactics and mind games, while also trying to convey his lingering affections towards his former lover. As the situation escalated, the ex-girlfriend found herself in an extremely difficult position, torn between the love and trust she was developing for Joel, and the complex history she shared with Dennis. This led her to question the authenticity of Dennis's feelings and his real motives for interfering in her new relationship, causing her emotional turmoil and confusion. At the same time, Joel started to pick up on the increasing tension between himself and Dennis, as well as his girlfriend's growing uneasiness and uncertainty in their relationship. With the mounting pressure and attempts by Dennis to reconnect with his ex and break them apart, Joel was forced to take a hard look at his own motivations for pursuing this new romance which had consequences for both his personal and professional life. He started questioning if the initial attraction he felt for Dennis's ex-girlfriend stemmed from his genuine feelings towards her, or if it was merely sparked by his competitive nature and desire to prove a point to his former friend. As the stakes grew higher, Joel was compelled to confront the consequences of his actions and realized that his pursuit for validation and rivalry with Dennis might have led him down a path of heartache and broken relationships. Eventually, the ex-girlfriend decided that she needed to take control of her own life and emotions, and confront both Joel and Dennis to address their ongoing attempts to manipulate and control her decisions.

The reason for this is that the liver will still try to perform its function of cleaning the blood using enzymes, but the increased contamination might make the process more difficult or slower. This added stress on the liver could lead to reduced effectiveness in completing its other functions, such as producing bile and storing energy as glycogen.

Article: Cop lights (Photo: Conner Jay/The Salinas Californian) The body of a missing California woman likely sat in a Walmart parking lot for months before anyone noticed, according to authorities. Lauren Moss, 22, was reported missing out of Seaside, Calif., in mid-November, according to Monterey County Sheriff’s Office Cmdr. John Thornburg. Her body was found in a parked car in a Walmart parking lot in Salinas, Calif., last week, according to authorities. While toxicology results are still pending, it’s believed that the cause of death was likely a suicide. Store employees reported that the vehicle had been there for some time, had tinted windows and didn’t appear out of the ordinary, Salinas Police Cmdr. Vincent Maiorana said. Security camera footage of the parking lot showed the car had been parked in the lot since December, according to police, KTLA-TV reported. However, as employees began to look into the vehicle on Wednesday afternoon, they realized that there was a body inside and called police around 5 p.m. The body was badly decomposed and appeared to have been there for some time, Maiorana has said.

Lauren Jessie Moss, 22, was found dead inside her silver Volkswagen Jetta. The car was parked outside a Walmart store in Salinas near East Boronda Road and North Main Street. Moss was last seen alive in Seaside on Nov. 13, 2015, the same day that she left a rehab center. Someone reported the woman missing to police, and Seaside police opened a missing person case. On Feb. 3, Moss' body was found by Walmart employees. Salinas police said her car had dark-tinted windows, and a sunshade was covering the dashboard, making it difficult to spot someone inside. Her cause of death has not been determined by a coroner, Monterey County Sheriff's Cmdr. John Thornburg said. Salinas police officers said Moss' death was likely a suicide. Her sister told KSBW that she left a suicide note behind for her family, and a drug needle was found in the car. The sister believes that Moss died shortly after injecting herself with drugs. A Walmart spokesperson said they do not have personnel patrolling overnight, but they do have 24-hour surveillance cameras. When police looked through Walmart's security cameras, the footage only went back until December 2015. Footage from December showed the Jetta in the same parking spot. ||||| Nearly three months after she went missing, a 22-year-old woman’s body was found inside a car parked outside a Wal-Mart in Salinas, according to the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office.

The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not. Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.

Article:","completion":"Title: Earthquakes May Happen More on the East Coast, New Survey Says Hey kids, do you know what an earthquake is? It's when the ground shakes because of the movement of the Earth's plates. Well, a new study from some really smart people called geologists says that some parts of the United States might be more likely to have earthquakes. Guess what? It's the east coast! The geologists, who are like Earth detectives, did a big study called a \\"US Geological Survey.\\" They looked at many parts of the country and tried to figure out where earthquakes might happen. They discovered that the east coast of the United States has a higher chance of experiencing earthquakes compared to some other parts of the country. But why is this happening? The Earth's surface is made up of big pieces called plates. These plates can move and sometimes bump into each other. When they bump, it can cause the Earth to shake, which is an earthquake. It turns out that the plates on the east coast are moving in a way that makes earthquakes more likely. Now, you might wonder if this is something to be scared of. The good news is that although the risk of earthquakes is higher on the east coast, it's still pretty low compared to other places around the world. So, while we should always be prepared for an emergency, there's no need to worry too much. In conclusion, the new US Geological Survey shows that the east coast has a higher chance of experiencing earthquakes. But don't worry too much — it's important to always be prepared, and the good news is that the risk is still low compared to many other places in the world.

Step 1: Combine the terms with t on the right side of the equation: 17*t - 72 = -3*t + 38*t Since -3*t + 38*t has a common variable t, you can add the coefficients -3 and 38: -3 + 38 = 35 So the right side of the equation simplifies to: 17*t - 72 = 35*t Step 2: Now, we want to get all t terms on one side of the equation and all constant terms on the other side. To do this, subtract 17*t from both sides of the equation: 17*t - 72 - 17*t = 35*t - 17*t This simplifies to: -72 = 18*t Step 3: Now, we need to isolate t. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of t, which is 18: (-72) / 18 = (18*t) / 18 This simplifies to: -4 = t So, the solution to the equation 17*t - 72 = -3*t + 38*t is t = -4."},{"prompt":"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The expression of an organism's genotype is called its phenotype .

(CNN) -- If there's one thing we can all agree on when it comes to \\"Duck Dynasty\\" star Phil Robertson and the fallout from his interview with GQ, it's that everyone has an opinion. And, to be honest, that's about the only thing we can agree on. In the 24 hours since GQ released its January profile of Robertson and his family, who draw millions to A&E with their reality show \\"Duck Dynasty,\\" social media has seen more than its typical overuse of exclamation points and excessive capitalization. The back-and-forth has gotten so extensive, we wouldn't be surprised if you've forgotten what you're even arguing about. I don't see a distinction between the two,\\" said another","completion":"user, referring to the blurred lines between Robertson's personal beliefs and his reality TV persona. \\"It's just a TV show. Why are people getting so worked up over it?\\" The big debate stems from Robertson's controversial comments concerning homosexuality, race, and religion during his GQ interview. Some lauded the \\"Duck Dynasty\\" patriarch for expressing his opinions openly, while others were appalled by the remarks and called for his suspension from the reality show. A&E initially suspended Robertson, but later reinstated him after facing backlash from fans and supporters. As a result, the situation erupted into a conversation about freedom of speech versus the consequences of expressing certain beliefs. Celebrities, politicians, and everyday people alike joined the discussion, weighing in on whether Robertson's comments should have been met with punishment or if his right to free speech was violated. The heart of the matter, though, lies in the age-old struggle between differing perspectives and beliefs. As a society, we still grapple with the question of how to balance our eagerness for open dialogue with the need to hold individuals accountable for their words. On one hand, many argue that the beauty of free speech is the ability to express one's beliefs without fear of reprisal. By imposing consequences on someone like Robertson, are we stifling our own progress in fostering a culture of openness and understanding? On the other hand, critics of Robertson's comments assert that this is not just about freedom of speech. It's about responsibility and the impact such divisive language can have on marginalized populations. They assert that those in the public eye have a unique platform and should be held to a higher standard when it comes to using their voice. The conversation spurred by the Phil Robertson controversy is far from over, and likely won't be resolved any time soon. Instead, it serves as a microcosm of the larger issues society continuously grapples with – freedom of speech, responsibility, and the ongoing battle for equal rights and understanding among all. In the end, let us remember that it is vital to engage in respectful conversations about these difficult topics, but it is also crucial to forgive and learn from our mistakes. Furthermore, we should make a conscious effort not to let emotions and opinions divide us; rather, let them spark meaningful discussions that lead to greater understanding and unity. That is the only way true progress and harmony can be achieved. What the long-term consequences of the \\"Duck Dynasty\\" incident will be, or how Robertson's views may evolve, remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: as long as we remain open to discussions and strive for empathy, growth, and unity, we will continue to learn more about not just each other, but ourselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Italy Q: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Help as much as you can. When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a monsoon is in the area happens, how will it affect less rain falls. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The introduction of a monsoon or heavy rainfall to the area indeed has an effect on the process of rain damaging the wood and its finish. With a monsoon, there will be significantly more rain, which can lead to the following consequences: 1. Accelerated damage: With increased rain, the wood is subjected to a greater amount of water seeping into its surface. As a result, the deterioration of the wood's finish will occur at a faster pace than it would under normal rainfall conditions. 2. Higher moisture content: The high volume of rain from a monsoon will saturate the wood, increasing its moisture content. This can cause wood to swell and potentially lead to structural damage, depending on its location and components. 3. Increased likelihood of mold and mildew growth: The higher moisture content in the wood, coupled with the humid conditions created by a monsoon, can promote mold and mildew growth, which further deteriorates the wood and may pose health risks to occupants if the wood is part of a building structure. 4. Longer drying times: Due to the excessive rain, it will take longer for the wood to dry out after the monsoon ends. This prolonged period of dampness can deepen the deterioration of the finish and increase the risk of further damage to the wood and its paint. 5. Weakened paint adhesion: As more rain seeps into the wood's surface, more finish will be removed when the water evaporates, leading to an overall weakening of the paint adhesion. This can make the wood appear worse and result in a more rapid loss of its protective coating. In conclusion, the perturbation of a monsoon in the area can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of rain damaging wood and its finish. The increased rain and humidity can accelerate the damage, increase the moisture content, promote mold and mildew growth, and weaken the paint adhesion, ultimately hastening the deterioration of the wood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's my 4-star review of the PPSSPP emulator. Pros: 1. High Compatibility - The PPSSPP emulator supports a wide array of PSP games, which was a pleasant surprise. I was able to play games like God of War: Chains of Olympus and Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core with minimal issues, thanks to its great compatibility. 2. Excellent Performance - This app provides an impressive performance in terms of emulation. On my mid-range device, most games run smoothly with little to no frame drops, which is quite commendable. 3.

Some Glitches - Although the performance is generally excellent, I did encounter some minor glitches or graphical errors in certain games. These were not game-breaking, but they did slightly affect the gaming experience. In conclusion, the PPSSPP emulator (org.ppsspp.ppsspp) offers a fantastic way to play your favorite PSP games on your device.

Firstly, let us understand the key differences between these two questions: 1. \\"Why are people not answering my questions on Quora?\\" - This question focuses on people not answering your questions in general. 2. \\"Why don't people answer me on Quora?\\" - This question also refers to people not answering your questions but may imply a more personal aspect, i.e., 'why don’t people answer me?' specifically. Both these questions essentially address the same concern, so based on the given options, the answer is [-] yes. Now, let's delve into some possible reasons why your questions might not be getting answered on Quora: 1. Quality and clarity of your questions: If your questions are not clear or lack proper context, other users might find it challenging to provide insightful answers. Make sure to be clear and concise while also providing enough background information. 2. Timing: The time when you post your question can also influence the chances of receiving answers. If you’re posting at a time when many users might be inactive, you may not get immediate responses. Experiment with posting at different times of the day to gauge when it’s most effective. 3. Uniqueness or popularity of your question: If your question has already been answered multiple times or if it pertains to a very niche topic, users might be less inclined to respond. 4. Competition with similar questions: With a surplus of questions being asked every day on Quora, it's possible that your question is overshadowed by others that have gained more traction or piqued the interest of potential answerers. 5. Incorrect or insufficient tagging: Quora relies heavily on tags to enable users to find questions that match their areas of expertise. Ensure that you tag your questions properly so that they reach your desired audience. 6. Expertise of the users: It could be that the users who have viewed your question simply do not have the knowledge or experience to provide a satisfactory answer. 7. Engagement with the community: Building an active presence on the platform can increase your chances of getting answers. Engage with others on Quora by answering questions, upvoting valuable answers, and adding comments. 8. Patience and persistence: Sometimes, it takes a while for questions to gain momentum and receive answers. It is crucial to be patient and persistent in your quest for answers on Quora. To increase your chances of receiving answers, you can: 1. Improve the quality and clarity of your questions. 2. Post questions at different times of the day to determine peak engagement. 3. Ensure proper tagging of questions to reach the appropriate audience. 4. Make your questions unique, interesting, or relevant to current trends. 5. Participate actively in the Quora community to build a more extensive network of potential answerers. 6. Keep an eye on the questions you post and update them if necessary, to refine their content or keep them in line with current trends. With these strategies in place, you will likely see an upswing in the engagement and answers your questions receive on Quora."},{"prompt":"We were talking about engagement when my boyfriend, Jack, had to go to war.

The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. What is an answer for this question: Which patient had fewer red blood cells, Dan or Jim? A:","completion":"Jim, the patient with sickle-cell anemia, likely had fewer red blood cells than Dan, the normal patient. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production and function of red blood cells. The crescent-shaped, or \\"sickle\\" red blood cells in individuals with this condition do not function as efficiently as normal cells in transporting oxygen, and they can break apart more easily, leading to a decrease in the overall number of red blood cells in the body. This results in a lower red blood cell count for Jim compared to Dan, who has a normal number of red blood cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - Mordred or Modred (Medrod, etc.) is a character in the Arthurian legend, known as a notorious traitor who fought King Arthur at the Battle of Camlann, where he was killed and Arthur fatally wounded. Tradition varies on his relationship to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations Morgause is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His brothers or half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth. The name (from either Old Welsh Medraut, Cornish Modred, or Old Breton Modrot) is ultimately derived from Latin \\"Modertus\\". - Sir Gareth (Old French: Guerrehet) was a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. He is nicknamed \\"Beaumains\\" in Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". He was the youngest son of Lot and of Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, thus making him Arthur's nephew, as well as brother to Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and half-brother to Mordred. - Lot or Loth is the king of Lothian in the Arthurian legend. He is best known as the father of Sir Gawain. Such a ruler first appeared late in the 1st millennium's hagiographical material concerning Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), which feature a \\"Leudonus\\", king of \\"Leudonia\\", a Latin name for Lothian. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted this to Lot, king of Lothian, in his influential chronicle \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\", portraying him as King Arthur's brother-in-law and ally. In the wake of Geoffrey's writings, Lot appeared regularly in later romance. - The Eagle is the final novel in the A Dream of Eagles series ( published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles ) . The Eagle follows the continuing story of Clothar ( Lancelot ) from when he meets Arthur Pendragon , to , and possibly after , King Arthur 's death . It also is noted for having a sympathetic portrait of Mordred . The novel was released on November 19 , 2005 in Canada and was released in the United States in 2007 . - Jack Whyte (born 1940) is a Scottish-Canadian novelist of historical fiction. Born and raised in Scotland, Whyte has been living in Canada since 1967. He resides in Kelowna, British Columbia. - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - A Dream of Eagles is a historical novel series written by the Canadian author Jack Whyte. It was published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles. - Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the lake, baptised as Galahad) was one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age until his adultery with Queen Guinevere is discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom. - Morgause is a character in later Arthurian traditions, appearing in Thomas Malory's 15th-century text \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" as the mother of Gawain and Mordred, both key players in the story of King Arthur and his downfall. Mordred is the offspring of Arthur's inadvertent incest with Morgause, the king's estranged half-sister. She is also a sister of Morgan le Fay and the wife of King Lot of Orkney, as well as the mother of Gareth, Agravain, and Gaheris. - Sir Galahad (sometime referred to as Galeas or Galath ), in Arthurian legend, is a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the LancelotGrail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". - Sir Agravain (sometimes spelled Agravaine) is a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian Legend. In Chrétien de Troyes, the Vulgate, Post-Vulgate cycles and Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", he is the second eldest son of King Lot of Orkney with Anna/Morgause/Morgan (Arthur's sister), thus nephew of King Arthur, and brother to Sir Gawain, Gaheris, and Gareth, and half-brother to Mordred.

The journeyman outfielder spent a good chunk of time at the major league level with the Phillies last season, although he was ultimately released in August due to posting a sub-.700 OPS both in the majors and with Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Although Detroit's center field situation is still pretty murky, it would take an uncharacteristically strong spring from Lough for him to supplant Tyler Collins, Mikie Mahtook, or JaCoby Jones for big-league playing time. Hypothesis: It will be tough for Lough to jump to big league playing time.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis stating that it will be tough for Lough to jump to big league playing time appears to be true. There are several reasons supporting this hypothesis: 1. Lough's performance: He was released from the Phillies in August due to his sub-.700 OPS (On-base Plus Slugging) performance both in the majors and with Triple-A Lehigh Valley. This suggests that he has had recent struggles in his performance, which may be a hindrance in securing big-league playing time. 2. Competition: The paragraph mentions that Detroit's center field situation is still pretty murky, but there are already other players like Tyler Collins, Mikie Mahtook, and JaCoby Jones in contention for big-league playing time. This indicates that Lough will face stiff competition to find a spot in the lineup. 3. Uncharacteristic spring performance required: To have any chance of supplanting his competitors for a regular spot, Lough would need to deliver an uncharacteristically strong spring performance. This means he has to outperform not only his recent history but also the performance of his competitors, which could be difficult. In conclusion, given Lough's recent subpar performance, the strong competition he faces, and the need for an exceptional spring performance, the hypothesis that it will be tough for Lough to jump to big league playing time is true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Flowers of War Movie plot: In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party.

They had a lot of money because their company was very successful. But the boss and his wife were not happy together anymore, so they decided they didn't want to be married. When people don't want to be married anymore, they have something called a divorce. The boss and his wife started to argue about who should get what from their big house, their money, and everything else they had together. They were so angry with each other that they couldn't agree on how to share their things, so they asked for help from a very important person called a judge. The judge looked at all the boss and wife's money, and he saw that they had so much that it was more than enough for both of them to live a very nice life. So, he told them, \\"If you both just stop arguing and agree on how to share your things, you would both live in great happiness and comfort!\\" The important lesson here is that sometimes people can get very angry when they don't agree, but if they take a step back and find a solution, they can be very happy in the end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Subject: The subject of the sentence is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is implied that the person being addressed is the subject. In an imperative sentence like this, the subject is often left implied, making it understandable. 2. Verb: \\"Write\\" is the main verb in the sentence, and it's in the imperative form. This instructs the subject of the sentence, typically the listener or reader, to perform the action (writing in this case). 3. Direct Object: \\"a letter\\" is the direct object in the sentence, as it is the thing being acted upon by the verb (write). 4. Prepositional Phrase: \\"to Anne Elliott.\\" The preposition \\"to\\" shows the relationship between the direct object (a letter) and the recipient (Anne Elliott). The proper noun \\"Anne Elliott\\" serves as the object of the preposition, or the person receiving the letter.

Since the tower was not yet finished, the bell was mounted in New Palace Yard but, during testing it cracked beyond repair and a replacement had to be made. The bell was recast on 10 April 1858 at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry as a 131⁄2 ton (13.76-tonne) bell. The second bell was transported from the foundry to the tower on a trolley drawn by sixteen horses, with crowds cheering its progress; it was then pulled 200 ft (61.0 m) up to the Clock Tower's belfry, a feat that took 18 hours. It is 7 feet 6 inches (2.29 m) tall and 9 feet (2.74 m) diameter. This new bell first chimed in July 1859; in September it too cracked under the hammer. According to the foundry's manager, George Mears, the horologist Denison had used a hammer more than twice the maximum weight specified. For three years Big Ben was taken out of commission and the hours were struck on the lowest of the quarter bells until it was repaired. To make the repair, a square piece of metal was chipped out from the rim around the crack, and the bell given an eighth of a turn so the new hammer struck in a different place. Big Ben has chimed with a slightly different tone ever since, and is still in use today with the crack unrepaired. Big Ben was the largest bell in the British Isles until \`\`Great Paul'', a 163⁄4 ton (17 tonne) bell currently hung in St Paul's Cathedral, was cast in 1881. Is the following statement correct based on the text has big ben got a crack in it","completion":"Yes, sweetie, that's right! Big Ben has a crack in it. The bell we call Big Ben developed a crack soon after it first chimed in 1859, but instead of replacing the bell again, a small piece of metal was removed from the rim of the bell where the crack was. Then, they simply turned the bell a little so the hammer would hit it in a new spot. So, Big Ben is still working with that crack today. It might sound a bit different because of the crack, but it's still going strong!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Article:Confirmation that Esa's Rosetta spacecraft had achieved its historic rendezvous with a comet was greeted with applause, wide grins and shouts of \\"yes, yes!\\", but none of the wild cheering we saw when Curiosity touched down on Mars two years ago. But although Europe's style may be more muted, what's been achieved in the dark reaches of space far beyond Mars is remarkable by any standards. You could almost feel the sense of relief in the corridors that, after managing a 10-year trek through space with extraordinary accuracy, and after investing more than one billion euros, all has gone so well. The signal took nearly 23 minutes to reach us and, when it came, it was a dip in a line on a graph. But this showed that the final burn to reach the comet had finished and this key moment was the trigger for a wave of pride rather than jubilation. Getting a spacecraft to match the speed of a comet and effectively ride alongside it is a landmark in space exploration. But the hard work starts now. Just trying to comprehend the weird structure and shape of the comet is difficult enough, according to many here. As one scientist put it, it's like driving along the motorway for hours and then turning off into a busy town where everything is confusing. The next batches of pictures, taken from just 100km away, should provide some answers. Another challenge is coping with the slight but irregular pulls of the comet's gravity - Rosetta is now just close enough to feel them. The plan is to fly around the comet in a series of loops, and managing that task will take real care. One of many puzzles is why the first readings of the surface temperature are not colder, an indicator that there might not be as much ice as expected. On the other hand, one instrument has picked up traces of water flowing from the comet so we know there must be ice there. The destination has been reached but the journey of understanding is only just starting.

Question: Information: - Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as AIDS. This stage is often also associated with weight loss. HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years. In 2015 about 36.7 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 1.1 million deaths. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39 million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemica disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV is believed to have originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention... - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test.... - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age. - Vaccination is the administration of antigenic material (a vaccine) to stimulate an individual's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen. Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, this results in herd immunity. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine, the HPV vaccine, and the chicken pox vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five preventable infections. - Miliary tuberculosis ( also known as \`\` disseminated tuberculosis '' , \`\` tuberculosis cutis acuta generalisata '' , and \`\` Tuberculosis cutis disseminata '' ) is a form of tuberculosis that is characterized by a wide dissemination into the human body and by the tiny size of the lesions ( 1 -- 5 mm ) . Its name comes from a distinctive pattern seen on a chest radiograph of many tiny spots distributed throughout the lung fields with the appearance similar to millet seeds -- thus the term \`\` miliary '' tuberculosis . Miliary TB may infect any number of organs , including the lungs , liver , and spleen . Miliary tuberculosis is present in about 2 % of all reported cases of tuberculosis and accounts for up to 20 % of all extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases . - Sputum is mucus and is the name used for the coughed-up material (phlegm) from the lower airways (trachea and bronchi). This process is known as sputilization. In medicine, sputum samples are usually used for naked eye exam, microbiological investigations of respiratory infections and cytological investigations of respiratory systems. It is critical that the patient not give a specimen that includes any mucoid material from the interior of the nose. Naked eye exam of sputum can be done at home by a patient in order to note the various colors (see below). Any hint of yellow color suggests an airway infection (but does not indicate between the types of organisms causing it). Such color hints are best detected when the sputum is viewed on a very white background such as white paper, a white pot, or a white sink surface. The more intense the yellow color, the more likely it is a bacterial infection (bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, or pneumonia). - A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \\"wild\\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are being investigated).

Article: Once upon a time if we wanted to make a phone call or wait for someone to contact us, we had to sit at home or at our desks. There were public phones in the street of course, _ . And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not? Because the worrying thing is we can't live without our phones. We've become communication addicts, unable to spend even a few minutes out of contact, in case we miss something 'important'.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If you had someone break up with you, one of your first thoughts might be that of revenge, especially if you didn’t see the breakup coming. You may think that getting revenge on the person who broke up with you might make you feel better, or at the very least give you a sense of justice, but it won’t. Revenge will just end up making you feel worse. Don’t make any decisions after a break up until you are calm and rational. Give yourself time to heal before you ‘do’ anything. You most likely want revenge because you feel your trust has been broken, but getting revenge is not going to help to restore any of that trust. Whether you were the one who initiated the break-up, or someone broke up with you, you need to let go of any regret you may harbour. If someone broke up with you, you likely had little or no control over the event, so it is a waste of your time to dwell on what might have been. If you broke up with someone, you probably had a good reason. Remind yourself of that good reason when you start to feel regretful in order to demonstrate to yourself why you shouldn’t be upset you broke up with someone. Regardless of what happened, take the time to look at what weaknesses you might have that lead to the breakup. Whether you discover weaknesses or mistakes, realize that this is your change you learn from them. How can you do things differently in the future? Focus on things you can control and change. Try not to worry about the things out of your control. Whether you broke up with someone, or someone broke up with you, it is really easy to think of all the negative things that came from the breakup — things like feeling depressed and lonely. Try not to focus on these negative things, instead look at all the good and positive things that can (or have) come from the breakup. Write your feelings in a journal. Write specifically about the positive things that have happened because of the breakup. These positive things might be things you learned while in the relationship, or they may be the good reasons why the breakup was necessary. They can also include the positive outcomes that have resulted because of the breakup. Before you started to date this person you probably had a routine that you followed regularly. That routine was probably dropped or changed once you started dating. Now that you no longer have anyone else to worry about, get back into your routine. Start up your normal exercise routine again. Get back into the shape you were before the relationship. Spend more time working on extra work or home projects, anything you put aside during your relationship because you had no time. Plan and cook healthy meals regularly. Schedule and attend any missed or delayed appointments such as the dentist or the eye doctor. When in a relationship you always have two people on the top of your priority list — you and your partner.

Will iron left out in a dry area such as a desert, or iron left in a damp area like a rain forest corrode faster? Two sailors, Jim and Eric decide to buy boats. The boats they buy ave a decent amount of iron in the construction and will be exposed to water almost constantly. Jim decides to coat his boat in a protective seal that seals out water and air. Eric thinks this is unnecessary and does not buy the protective seal. Hint: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year.

They travel to the Norwegian base, Thule Station, located in Antarctica near U.S. Outpost 31, in a helicopter manned by Carter (Joel Edgerton), Derek (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Griggs (Paul Braunstein). After viewing the spacecraft, Kate, Sander, and Adam are told the group also discovered an alien body from the crash, buried in the ice nearby. In the afternoon the body is brought to the base in a block of ice. That evening, while the team celebrates their find, Derek sees the alien burst from the ice and escape the building. The team searches for the creature and discovers that it killed Lars' dog. Olav and Henrik find the alien, which then grabs and engulfs Henrik. The rest of the group arrive and set fire to the creature, killing it. An autopsy of the scorched alien corpse reveals that its cells were consuming and imitating Henrik's own.

Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split.

Answer the following question: This article: Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM.

I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The fault lines grow over time - The rocks on each side of the fault lines rub against the rocks on the other side of the fault line - The rocks put pressure on each other - The rocks break from the pressure - The breaking of the rocks releases a lot of energy - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves make the earth shake. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the given process is the formation of tectonic plates and their movement along the Earth's surface. To better understand the complete process, let's explore each step in detail: 1. Formation of tectonic plates and their movement: The Earth's outermost layer, called the lithosphere, is composed of solid rock plates known as tectonic plates. These plates float atop the asthenosphere, a highly viscous and partially molten layer found beneath the lithosphere. The movement of tectonic plates is primarily driven by the process of convection within the asthenosphere and Earth's mantle, along with the forces acting at plate boundaries. There are three main types of plate boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform. 2. The fault lines grow over time: As tectonic plates move and interact with one another, stress accumulates within their interiors and at their boundaries, leading to the formation and growth of cracks or fractures known as fault lines. Fault lines can extend for many miles and are zones of weakness within the Earth's crust. 3. The rocks on each side of the fault lines rub against the rocks on the other side of the fault line: As tectonic plates continue to move, the rocks on one side of a fault line rub against the rocks on the other side, causing friction and further stress accumulation in the area. 4. The rocks put pressure on each other: The continuous movement and interaction between the tectonic plates cause the rocks on each side of a fault line to experience compressional, tensional, or shear forces. These forces put pressure on the rocks, further increasing stress in the area. 5. The rocks break from the pressure: Eventually, the accumulated stress becomes too great for the rocks to withstand, causing them to break or slip along the fault line. This sudden release of energy is known as an earthquake. 6. The breaking of the rocks releases a lot of energy: The rapid movement of the rock masses along the fault line results in the release of a significant amount of stored strain energy in the form of seismic waves. 7. The energy causes seismic waves: Seismic waves, which include both body waves that travel through the Earth's interior and surface waves that travel along the Earth's surface, propagate outward from the earthquake's epicenter. These waves carry the energy released during the earthquake and can travel vast distances. 8. The seismic waves make the earth shake: As seismic waves travel through the Earth and along its surface, they cause the ground to shake and vibrate. The shaking can cause various types of damage, including the collapse of buildings and other structures, landslides, and tsunamis, depending on the magnitude of the earthquake and the specific site characteristics of the affected region. In conclusion, the missing first step in the given process is the formation and movement of the Earth's tectonic plates. This movement and interaction create fault lines, which become the source of earthquakes as stress accumulates and rocks eventually break, releasing significant amounts of energy in the form of seismic waves and causing the ground to shake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain.

Golden Curry is typically made using a flavorful and aromatic blend of mixed spices and a variety of carefully selected ingredients. This vegetarian-friendly dish is prepared with a roux that incorporates wheat flour and seasoned to perfection with a harmonious combination of vegetables such as onions, carrots, potatoes, and other ingredients like chilies, turmeric, cumin, and coriander. Traditional Japanese curry is commonly enjoyed with rice and can include a portion of protein like chicken, beef, or even seafood. The data also mentions the presence of a location named \\"The Bakers,\\" indicating there is a Golden Curry near this establishment. The Bakers, perhaps a bakery or a restaurant, could potentially be complemented by its proximity to the delicious Japanese cuisine offered by the Golden Curry in its vicinity. This would provide customers with an opportunity to explore the unique and aromatic flavors of Japanese Curry and satisfy their culinary cravings, while also benefiting from the convenience of being close to other food establishments like The Bakers. In conclusion, Golden Curry, a prominent brand for Japanese curry, offers a fantastic gastronomic experience and a celebration of Japan's culinary heritage, which has become increasingly appealing to food enthusiasts in various parts of the world. With the mention of its proximity to The Bakers, customers are in for a treat to explore the rich and diverse flavors of exquisite Japanese curry while benefitting from the convenience offered by a variety of food establishments within the same area."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Photographed 500 feet above the central highlands and southern parts of Iceland, the dams and rivers take on amazingly sweeping shapes and colours as the water passes through glaciers and dams. Russian photographer Andre Ermolaev travelled to Iceland to capture the unique beauty of its landscape. Awash with colour: Russian Photographer Andre Ermolaev captured the incredible landscape featuring rivers and dams streaming from Iceland's glaciers. The 57-year-old from Moscow said: ‘When we were in the plane we saw a river which had flown through several dams and the water is a transparent blue. ‘A bit upstream there is a little yellow stream that flows into this river and mixes with the water. Bird's eye view: The photographer flew 500 feet above the rivers, capturing their sweeping shapes as they passed through glaciers and dams. To the sea: The water changes colour as it moves through glaciers and flat, sandy areas, creating amazing shapes and effects.

A Jewish barber saves the life of a wounded pilot, Schultz (Reginald Gardiner), but loses his own memory through concussion. Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel Twenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the barber escapes from his care-home to return to the ghetto. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who looks like an identical twin of the barber (both played by Chaplin). The barber falls in love with a neighbor's daughter Hannah (Paulette Goddard), and together they try to resist persecution by storm troopers. The storm troopers capture the barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz remembers that the barber had saved his life during the war, and restrains them. Hynkel tries to finance his military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy, and is removed from office and sent to a concentration camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to mount an assassination attempt against Hynkel, but they sensibly decline to participate in his violent plan. Stormtroopers search the ghetto, arresting Schultz and the barber. They are sent to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom in the neighboring country of Osterlich. Hynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Napaloni (a spoof of Mussolini played by Jack Oakie), over which country should invade Osterlich. After signing a treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel invades Osterlich. The Jewish family is trapped by the invading force. Escaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel.

One of the newcomers changes the magazine on his shotgun and begins to fire several powerful rounds that pass through the entire width of the car Tuggle is hiding behind. Tuggle is hit in the chest by one of the shots and dies immediately. Sykes, enraged at his longtime partner's death, takes off after Tuggle's killers.Rushing into a dark tunnel near the store, the Newcomer Sykes chases pulls out a small vial of blue fluid and deposits a small amount on his tongue. The substance is clearly a drug and the newcomer, invigorated by it's effects, furiously charges Sykes. Sykes fires several shots into the alien's chest, who seems unaffected at first but eventually drops. When Sykes is found by the backup that arrives, one of the officers tries to help him to his feet. When Sykes sees that the officer is a Newcomer, he violently pushes him away and hits him.The next day at his headquarters, Sykes joins his company for the morning debriefing. Everyone is saddened by Tuggles' death and their captain announces that they'll be taking in a new officer, someone who happens to be a Newcomer, the 1st one to be promoted to detective. Sykes volunteers to take the Newcomer, Detective Francisco, as his new partner, despite his obvious prejudice about their species.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Eldrick Tont Woods (born December 30, 1975) better known as Tiger Woods, is an American professional golfer who is among the most successful golfers of all time. He has been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years. Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur career, Woods was 20 years old when he turned professional at the end of summer in 1996. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters. Context: Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight Ridder asked in a column, \\"Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?\\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not). At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week. A related effect was measured by University of California economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored higher when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003-04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a \\"superstar\\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort. Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as \\"Tiger-Proofing\\". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win. Question: Tell me more about the strategy.. Whats the answer?","completion":"The strategy in question, known as \\"Tiger-Proofing,\\" was implemented by various golf courses and tournament organizers in response to Tiger Woods' dominance in the sport. The concern was that Woods' unmatched skill level and long driving distance were making the game less competitive and even discouraging for other professional golfers. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the Tiger-Proofing strategy and its impact: 1. Identifying the Problem: Early in Tiger Woods' career, his exceptional skills and consistent wins caused concern among golf experts and fans who worried that this dominance would negatively impact the sport's competitiveness and its appeal to golf enthusiasts. 2. The \\"Superstar\\" Effect: A study by economist Jennifer Brown discovered that golfers tended to score higher when playing against Tiger Woods, indicating that his presence in tournaments increased the level of difficulty for other professionals. This phenomenon is described as the \\"superstar\\" effect, where facing an exceptional competitor can decrease the motivation and effort of other players. 3. Implementing the Strategy: Several golf courses, including major championship venues such as Augusta National, decided to \\"Tiger-Proof\\" their courses by adding yardage to their tees. This change aimed to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods by making the courses more challenging overall, thereby making it more difficult for him to dominate the field. 4. Reaction of Tiger Woods: Despite the attempts to \\"Tiger-Proof\\" golf courses, Woods maintained a positive attitude about the changes. He argued that increasing the yardage did not affect his ability to win and that he welcomed the challenge. 5. Outcome and Effectiveness: Tiger-Proofing may have succeeded in making courses more challenging for all players, including Woods. However, it did not dramatically impact Woods' ability to win or significantly alter the competitiveness of the game, as he continued to have a successful career. Additionally, Tiger Woods' impact on the sport inspired a new generation of talented golfers who have contributed to the growth and popularity of golf. In conclusion, the Tiger-Proofing strategy aimed to make the game more competitive by altering golf course designs to reduce the advantages of long hitters like Tiger Woods. While this strategy may have increased the challenge for all players to some extent, it did not prevent Woods from achieving continued success in the sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun.

Movie title: Shooter Movie plot: As the film opens, US Special Forces sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and his scout Donny Fenn (Lane Garrison) lie in wait in the hills of Ethiopia, ready to deliver covering fire for a US convoy heading back to base through hostile country. They pass the time with small talk, and Donny looks at a photo of his wife, Sarah (Kate Mara). Far below, a lone truck carrying a machine gun in the back speeds towards the American convoy. Swagger takes out the shooter and driver, each with a single shot to the head. It seems like the mission is over as the Americans make their way down the road until a horde of hostile militia appear, firing on the soldiers. Donny relays target information while Swagger systematically picks off numerous hostiles, allowing the US forces to escape.Protecting the convoy has revealed the sniper's position, and soon the two snipers are under heavy fire. Back at base, their commanding officer is more concerned about avoiding detection, as the Americans aren't supposed to be in the country, and Swagger and Donny are abandoned, left to fend for themselves, left for dead. An enemy helicopter begins to strafe their position. Donny is killed. Swagger fires futilely at the helicopter with his sniper rifle until he uncovers a Barret 50 caliber VBM82A3 SASR, and returns fire on the helicopter, bringing it down in flames.

Inspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a civil union with him. Although at first Chuck declines, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees.Chuck and Larry become domestic partners and Chuck becomes Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. Soon, New York City investigators arrive to inquire about their partnership. They lie to the investigator by saying that they are really in love with each other and insist they've been having \\"Loads of Sex, Gay-crazy sex, Man on Man, Loving Every Minute\\". Chuck and Larry then decide to enlist the help of a lawyer, Alex McDonough, who suggests that they get married. Chuck and Larry then marry in Canada and move in together. When they get married in Canada, the Asian minister who proclaims \\"I Now Pronounce You, 'Husband and Husband, You May Now Kiss The Husband\\" is shocked to see Chuck and Larry slap each other the cheek (as opposed to kissing) when ordered to \\"Kiss the Husband\\". Chuck and Larry then retort by saying \\"That's How We Roll In Our House, Baby\\".On the first night of...

Answer the following question: Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door. The kitchen stank of stale cigarettes and the dregs of spirit bottles.

Article: If you have been getting poor grades on homework assignments, it's time to up your game and put a little more effort into them. Even if each assignment is not worth that much, your cumulative grade for homework can be a big chunk of your final grade. Be sure you understand what you are supposed to do before you leave class. If you have any questions about how to complete the homework assignment, ask your teacher for clarification. Always read the directions (or listen to them) and follow them precisely. Don't be lazy and write fewer words than were asked of you or neglect to show your work. Always write down when each assignment is due and hand it in on time. There's nothing worse than getting points off for handing in an assignment late because you forgot that it was due! If keeping track of your assignments in a planner or a digital calendar helps keep you organized, then be sure to record all of your homework assignments there. Try planning out a specific time to complete each assignment, and be sure to take other obligations into consideration. For example, if you know that you have a basketball game on Thursday and will only have one hour to work on homework, don't put off any assignments until Thursday that can be completed on Wednesday. If you missed any assignments because you were absent or because you simply didn't do them, ask your teacher if you can hand them in late. While you may only get partial credit for make-up work, it's definitely better than having a zero for that assignment. Ask about the possibility of making up in-class assignments that you missed as well as homework. Offer to come to the classroom during lunchtime or a free period to work on them. Try asking your teacher to revise an essay, re-take a test, or re-do a project that you got a bad grade on. You could suggest that the teacher could replace the grade or average the two grades together. Your teacher may be willing to let you do this if you seem committed to bringing your grade up. Try to focus on substantive assignments that have a bigger impact on your overall grade rather than smaller assignments such as homework that may not make as big of a difference. While you may want to do whatever you can to improve a specific grade, it's important to be smart about it. Do not bring up one grade at the expense of another, whether it's for the same class or another one. Focus the majority of your energy on the assignments that will earn you the most points. For example, if your final project is worth 50% of your grade and your homework assignments are worth 10%, spend more time studying for the final than working on your homework. This does not mean you should not do your other work, but simply that you should not spend as much time on it. Never neglect a current assignment in favor of make-up work unless you are sure that you will earn more points for it. Don't neglect your other classes either. You shouldn't end up with a bad grade in one class because you were focusing all of your energy on trying to improve your grade in another. This will have a negative effect on your overall GPA. What is a summary?","completion":"In summary, improving your grades on homework assignments requires consistent effort, organization, and effective time management. Firstly, ensure that you understand the assignment by asking your teacher for clarification if needed. Next, follow directions carefully and submit your work on time. Use a planner or digital calendar to keep track of your assignments and allocate specific time for each task, taking your other obligations into account. If you've missed any assignments, ask your teacher if you can submit them late or make up in-class work. Consider focusing on substantive assignments that have a more significant impact on your overall grade. However, do not neglect other classes or assignments, as this could negatively affect your overall GPA.

News article: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to round up corrupt officials and toss them from his helicopter midflight — and it wouldn’t be the first time he’s done it, he says. In a speech at Camarines Sur in the northern Philippines on Tuesday, Duterte reportedly recounted throwing an alleged kidnapper to his death — furnishing details about how high the pilot had to fly — while he was mayor of Davao City, according to local newspaper the Philippine Star. “If you are corrupt, I will fetch you with a helicopter and I will throw you out on the way to Manila,” the newspaper quoted him as saying in Tagalog during the speech. “I have done that before, why should I not do it again?” Duterte was in Camarines Sur after touring provinces ravaged by Typhoon Nock-Ten, which made landfall on Christmas Day. But after he announced financial assistance packages for disaster-stricken areas, talk swung to the anticorruption drive he stressed would be a main focus of his six-year term — alongside his antidrug campaign, which has seen over 6000 people killed in brutal, extrajudicial fashion. The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now Duterte is notorious for his outbursts. He once said he should have “been first” in the gang rape of an Australian missionary in a prison riot in 1989. He also said he would kill his own children if they used drugs. Earlier this month, Duterte admitted to personally killing three people. Members of Duterte’s Cabinet habitually dial back on such utterances, claiming that they are jokes or hyperbole. However, the U.N. human-rights commission has urged the Philippines to launch a murder investigation into Duterte’s claims. Write to Joseph Hincks at joseph.hincks@timeinc.com. ||||| MANILA, Philippines – Is this another joke or hyperbole? President Duterte vowed yesterday that corrupt officials would suffer the same fate as kidnap suspects he claimed to have thrown off a helicopter in mid-flight when he was mayor of Davao City. Duterte made reference on how he dealt with criminals in the past to drive a point that he is serious about his government’s anti-corruption drive. “If you are corrupt I will fetch you with a helicopter and I will throw you out on the way to Manila,” he said in Filipino yesterday in a speech at the Camarines Sur provincial capitol after he visited disaster-stricken areas affected by Typhoon Nina. “I have done that before, why should I not do it again?” said Duterte after he announced that he was giving between P50 million to P100 million in financial assistance for disaster-stricken areas, in addition to a standby P1-billion calamity fund. Duterte stressed that his anti-corruption drive, like his anti-drug campaign, will remain the main focus of his six-year term. He has already gotten flak from international human rights groups over summary executions and his recent admission that he personally hunted criminals and killed them when he was Davao mayor. Duterte narrated an incident when he had to go after kidnappers of a Chinese who mercilessly abused their victim even after the parents paid ransom. Duterte recalled ordering the pilot to fly at the proper height, indicating the helicopter must be at the right distance from the ground so the body’s splatter won’t cause a commotion. ‘Take it or leave it’ Duterte offered no apologies for his harsh language, which had in the past triggered outrage from US President Barack Obama, members of the United Nations and the European Union. He said it is just the way he speaks. “I am that person, take it or leave,” he said. In a previous interview during the campaign, Duterte admitted killing three kidnap suspects during an encounter. He cited also a Chinese kidnap victim was involved in that operation which happened in 1988. There was a report of Duterte killing a drug dealer by dropping him off a helicopter when he was mayor, but it is not clear whether the President was referring to this incident in yesterday’s speech. In the same speech, Duterte even mentioned in passing that he did not spare two of his fraternity brothers for accepting P50-million bribe from a Macau-based online gambling operator of the Fontana Leisure Parks and Casino in Pampanga. After announcing his assistance to the disaster victims, Duterte reiterated anew his seriousness in the anti-drug campaign. This time, Duterte said he is faced with a tough problem on how to deal with four million drug users. “Out of the four million, at a liberal computation, just give me one million who had gone crazy. What will I do with them? Turn them into fertilizer? I can do that in Mindanao, but here you’ll just report it. But that’s our problem,” he said. In criminal lingo, only rotten bodies turn up as fertilizers. Duterte also slammed the Catholic Church for criticizing him over the extrajudicial killings attributed to his brutal campaign against illegal drugs. He said he believes there is a God, he believes in Allah, but that he does not believe in religion, particularly the Catholic Church. “My statement’s full of sarcasm because they (priests) have been criticizing me,” the President told the gathering of Davao City barangay captains and kagawads last night. Duterte said he does not intend to follow any religious practice once he dies. “Cremate me within 24 hours when I die,” he said. – With Edith Regalado ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, said in a speech that he has thrown corrupt officials out of a helicopter before, and he will do it again if he needs to.

Output:","completion":"Part #1: Understand the given story's title and the three sentences. Usage: Title: Paul went on vacation with his family for a week. He lived in a bad neighborhood with a lot of crime. The cops had to fingerprint everything. In this part, we have to understand the background of the story. It tells about Paul going on vacation and living in a bad neighborhood. Part #2: Analyze the three additional sentence options. Usage: Choices: a. When Paul came home his home was a mess. b. Teddy lost his wallet at the concert. c. He was a little worried about his home. In this part, we need to carefully consider all three options and think about which ones connect well with the main story. Part #3: Choose two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story. Usage: Selecting option a and option c. These two options connect well with the story as they both pertain to Paul and the situation of his home. Option b about Teddy losing his wallet at the concert doesn't fit the story context. Part #4: Indicate the selected options in order. Usage: Options 'ac'. We first selected option a about Paul's house being a mess, and option c about him being worried about his home.

No The statement \\"In children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea, contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year.\\" does not answer the question \\"What is recommended by the WHO for malnutrition and diarrhea?\\" as it only provides information about the consequences of malnutrition and diarrhea in children. It does not provide any recommendations by the WHO for dealing with these issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) has several recommendations for addressing malnutrition and diarrhea, including the following: 1. Proper nutrition: Ensuring that children receive a balanced diet with adequate nutrients is key to preventing malnutrition. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of a child's life, followed by the introduction of complementary foods and continued breastfeeding until at least 24 months. Micronutrient supplements like vitamin A and zinc can also be provided to children at risk of malnutrition. 2. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT): Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which is particularly dangerous for young children. The WHO recommends treating dehydration caused by diarrhea with oral rehydration salts (ORS), a simple solution of sugar, salt, and water. ORS is an effective and low-cost treatment that can save lives in cases of severe diarrhea. 3. Zinc supplementation: Zinc supplements can help treat diarrhea and reduce the duration and severity of the illness. WHO recommends providing children with diarrhea 10-20 mg of zinc per day, depending on age, for 10 to 14 days. 4. Access to clean water and sanitation: Adequate access to clean drinking water and proper sanitation facilities can help reduce the prevalence of waterborne diseases, including diarrhea. The WHO advocates for improved water quality and sanitation in communities worldwide as part of their overall strategy for addressing malnutrition and diarrhea-related issues. 5. Rotavirus vaccination: Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children, especially in developing countries. WHO recommends the inclusion of rotavirus vaccines in national immunization programs to help prevent the spread of the disease and reduce the incidence of diarrhea in children. 6. Education and community engagement: Education on proper hygiene practices, such as handwashing with soap, can help prevent the spread of diarrhea-causing bacteria. In addition, community-based interventions, such as providing health information and training to local leaders, can be effective in addressing malnutrition and diarrhea at the local level. In summary, the statement provided does not answer the question on what the WHO recommends for malnutrition and diarrhea. Instead, the WHO offers various recommendations that include proper nutrition, oral rehydration therapy, zinc supplementation, clean water and sanitation, rotavirus vaccination, and community education and engagement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Tsunetane Oda (小田常胤 , Oda Tsunetane , March 10, 1892 – February 11, 1955) was a judoka who was influential in the development of Kosen judo. His correct name was Join Oda, but through a misinterpretation of the kanji 常胤 he is more commonly known as Tsunetane. Hypothesis: Tsunetane Oda and Join Oda were the same person.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Tsunetane Oda and Join Oda were indeed the same person based on the given context. The context highlights that Tsunetane Oda, born on March 10, 1892, and passed away on February 11, 1955, was a significant figure in the development of Kosen judo. It mentions that his correct name was in fact Join Oda, which is further clarified by the explanation of the misinterpretation of the kanji 常胤. This misinterpretation is mentioned as the reason why he is more commonly known as Tsunetane Oda. It's important to understand that the Japanese writing system includes kanji, which are borrowed Chinese characters that have their own unique pronunciation and meaning. The kanji 常胤, in this case, can be read as \\"Tsunetane,\\" which is a commonly known pronunciation. However, the kanji can also be read as \\"Join\\", which is the correct pronunciation of Oda's name. Due to the complexity of the Japanese writing system and the various ways kanji can be read, it's not unusual for misunderstandings and misinterpretations to occur. In addition to the shared birth and death dates, their contributions to the development of Kosen judo further confirm that these two names refer to the same individual. Kosen judo, an offshoot of Kodokan judo, emphasizes groundwork and newaza techniques, and has gained popularity in the judo community. Oda's influence and expertise in this area were instrumental in shaping the practice of Kosen judo, which solidifies the connection between the names Tsunetane Oda and Join Oda. Therefore, based on the context provided, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Tsunetane Oda and Join Oda were indeed the same person, with the latter being the correct name of the individual. This hypothesis can also be supported by the common birth and death dates, as well as their shared accomplishments and contributions to the field of Kosen judo."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(AP) — A woman who was stranded in the rugged Sierra Nevada for nine days while suffering from some broken bones survived by using a water filter to drink from a creek, authorities said. Miyuki Harwood, 62, was found Saturday morning in a remote area of the Sierra National Forest after she used a whistle to get the attention of a search and rescue team who were looking for her, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said at a news conference. Harwood was airlifted to a hospital to treat an unspecified injury sustained on Aug. 20 when she got separated from a group of hikers near Horsehead Lake, about 100 miles northwest of Fresno. She was listed in stable condition, the sheriff said after meeting Harwood at her hospital bed. \\"Her voice was strong. She was extremely thankful that people were looking for her,\\" Mims said. Harwood, of Folsom, Calif., was the focus of an intense search involving several law enforcement agencies after she got lost in the mountains. She broke some bones and couldn't hike back to her base camp, Mims said. She also had very little food and supplies because she was carrying just enough for a day trip. To survive, Harwood crawled for about two days from where she was injured to a creek where she could scoop water into a bottle with a filter inside. \\"She was a fighter,\\" said Rusty Hotchkiss, a California Highway Patrol flight officer and paramedic who flew Harwood to the hospital. \\"She was very exhausted — very tired, but she was very thankful to be saved and to get out of there,\\" he added. Mims said the search for Harwood was hampered by thick smoke from a wildfire that has burned 96 square miles nearby in the Kings Canyon National Park. ||||| Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed 1:44 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog A 62-year-old woman who vanished while hiking in California was found alive Saturday — more than a week after she was separated from the group she was traveling with, police said.

The search was initially hampered by smoke from a wildfire, called the Rough Fire, which began July 31 and was burning about 10 miles away from the search area. Officials also worried that the smoke would debilitate Harwood as rescuers scrambled to find her. Mims warned that hikers should not separate from their groups and stay away from trails with hazardous conditions. \\"Especially right now with the fires going on, now is not a good time to go up into that area.

Article:","completion":"Title: New Analysis Shifts MH370 Search Area Further South, Autopilot Suspected In a recent development, officials have announced that new analysis suggests the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 may have crashed further south than previously believed. The search efforts for the ill-fated airplane will now focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area in the southern Indian Ocean, based on updated satellite projections. The Australian Deputy Prime Minister has stated that it is \\"highly likely\\" the plane was on autopilot during the time of the crash, leading to a more precise calculation of the final location. This revelation comes after extensive studies and investigations were conducted to understand the events that unfolded on that fateful day. According to the new analysis, it is now believed that the aircraft continued flying in a southern direction on autopilot until it ran out of fuel, resulting in its tragic end in the Indian Ocean. The updated search area is in line with the original \\"southern corridor\\" identified as the most probable location for finding the wreckage of the missing aircraft. The shift in focus to the new 60,000 square kilometre area is based on the latest information provided by satellite projections. These projections offer a detailed map of the plane's likely trajectory and final location, enabling search and rescue teams to concentrate their efforts more effectively. Since the disappearance of flight MH370, several international agencies and experts have been working tirelessly to locate the wreckage and uncover the reasons behind the mysterious crash. The event has captured global attention, sparking numerous theories and discussions about the circumstances that led to the unfortunate incident. With an ever-changing landscape of information, theories, and analysis, it is crucial to remain flexible and responsive in the ongoing search for MH370. The newly identified area in the southern Indian Ocean offers hope to the families of the 239 people on board, as well as the international community as a whole, who are all eager for closure on this tragic event. In summary, the new analysis and satellite projections have led officials to shift the search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 further south. The Australian Deputy Prime Minister's statement regarding the likelihood of autopilot usage further supports the credibility of this new information. It is hoped that this updated approach will eventually lead to the discovery of the wreckage and provide answers to the many questions surrounding the flight's disappearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If aliens from outer space visited our planet, they might be surprised to find that we excrete waste through our genitals - which, of course, also have a vital use in reproduction. However, the Chinese soft-shell turtle has evolved to use a very different orifice to rid itself of waste . Most usually encountered at upmarket restaurants in China, where they are considered a delicacy, these unusual amphibians are the only animals known to urinate through their mouths. Wash your mouth out! The Chinese soft-shelled turtle is the only animal known to science that actually urinates through its mouth. Now scientists believe that this apparently unique ability helped the animals adapt to survive in swamps and marshes where the water is often brackish - that is, slightly salty. Scientists in the 19th Century discovered that the linings of the mouths of soft-shelled turtles are covered with tiny, finger-shaped protrusions. Subsequent research revealed that these allow the turtles to breathe underwater by increasing the surface area of the mouth where oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged. But Alex Yuen Kwong Ip of the National. University of Singapore believes that these characteristics evolved for. one reason only: to help the turtles urinate through their mouths more. easily. Here are some other Chinese delicacies that might seem odd to Western diners:. Together with Shit Fun Chew of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, Professor Ip kept four turtles in tanks of water for six days, New Scientist reported. Each animal had a tube attached to its cloaca, the posterior opening where amphibians usually excrete both urine and faeces, so Professor Ip could keep tabs on what emerged. The researchers found that, incredibly, only 6 per cent of the turtle's urea came out of the cloaca, with the rest mysteriously turning up in the tank's water. Professor Ip also restrained the turtles on land. He found that when he placed a bucket of water in front of them the creatures plunged their heads in for between 20 and 100 minutes. Observing more closely, he watched as they held some water in their mouths for a while then spat it out, increasing the concentration of the urea in the water. Delicacy: Chinese soft-shelled turtles are farmed across South East Asia, where they are considered a delicacy and are often served in upmarket restaurants. Professors Ip and Chew found that proteins in the turtle's mouth lining help to transport urea from its bloodstream. They managed to isolate on such protein and found it was only present in the mouth and not the kidney. 'I know of no other animal that can excrete urea through the mouth,' Professor Ip was quoted by New Scientist as saying. Most fish excrete through their gills, and lungfish and some amphibians can do so through their skin, but the Chinese soft-shelled turtle's oral excretion is almost certainly a one-off. Professor Ip believes oral urination helped the turtles adapt to life in brackish waters. To excrete urea via their kidneys and through their cloaca they would need to drink a lot of water to flush it through. That would mean consuming a lot of salt, which would be difficult for them to get rid of. So instead of drinking the backish water, the turtles are able to simply rinse their mouths with it. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article include: 1. The Chinese soft-shell turtle is considered unique in the animal kingdom for its ability to excrete waste, specifically urea, through its mouth rather than the usual genital route. 2. This unusual ability is thought to have evolved to help the turtles survive in swamps and marshes with brackish, or slightly salty, water. 3. Scientists in the 19th Century discovered that the linings of the mouths of soft-shelled turtles are covered with tiny, finger-shaped protrusions. These protrusions help the turtles breathe underwater by increasing the surface area where oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged. 4. Alex Yuen Kwong Ip of the National University of Singapore and Shit Fun Chew of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University conducted a study on four turtles to observe this phenomenon. They discovered that only 6% of the turtle's urea came out of the cloaca, with the rest being excreted through the mouth. 5. The researchers found that proteins in the turtle's mouth lining help transport urea from its bloodstream, allowing them to excrete wastes effectively using their mouth. 6. Oral urination is believed to have helped the turtles adapt to life in brackish waters, eliminating the need to consume large amounts of salty water to excrete via kidneys. 7.

How is \\"What's the move?\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"What's the move?\\" can be translated to \\"Jaký je tah?\\". It is important to note that languages often have multiple ways to convey a similar meaning, and the translation may slightly differ depending on the context or situation. Here, I'll provide a detailed breakdown of the translation and alternative phrases that may be relevant in different contexts. 1. Direct Translation: \\"Jaký je tah?\\" This is the most direct translation of \\"What's the move?\\". It comprises three words: \\"Jaký\\" (What), \\"je\\" (is), and \\"tah\\" (move, as in a course of action or maneuver). In Czech, the word \\"tah\\" is often used in the context of making a move in a game, such as in chess. In a more general context, this phrase could be used to ask about someone's course of action or next step. 2. Alternative Phrases: Depending on the context, there are some other phrases that can be used to convey the same meaning: - \\"Co dál?\\" (What next?): This phrase is more colloquial and can be used in casual conversation to inquire about the next step or action that someone is planning to take. - \\"Jaký máš plán\\" (What's your plan?): This can be used when asking someone about their plans or intentions for a given situation. It also implies a more proactive approach, asking the person to share their intentions. - \\"Kam dál?\\" (Where to next?): This phrase is useful when discussing travel or moving from one location to another, especially when seeking recommendations or directions. - \\"Co budeme dělat?\\" (What are we going to do?): This phrase is useful when discussing a decision or plan that involves multiple participants, such as a group of friends deciding on their next activity.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine. - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds. - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials. - Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements. - Hydrazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (also written ). A simple pnictogen hydride, it is a colorless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution. , approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year. Hydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but significant applications also include its uses as a precursor to polymerization catalysts and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion. Anhydrous hydrazine is corrosive towards glass, in a manner similar to hydrofluoric acid. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals. - The chalcogens are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the oxygen family. It consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive element polonium (Po). The chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium (Lv) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well. Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term \\"chalcogen\\" altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The word \\"chalcogen\\" is derived from a combination of the Greek word \\"khalks\\" () principally meaning copper (the term was also used for bronze/brass, any metal in the poetic sense, ore or coin), and the Latinised Greek word \\"gens\\", meaning \\"born\\" or \\"produced\\". - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals. - Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius. - Chromium trioxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CrO. It is the acidic anhydride of chromic acid, and is sometimes marketed under the same name. This compound is a dark-purple solid under anhydrous conditions, bright orange when wet and which dissolves in water concomitant with hydrolysis. Millions of kilograms are produced annually, mainly for electroplating. Chromium trioxide is a powerful oxidiser and a suspected carcinogen. - Pollucite is a zeolite mineral with the formula (Cs,Na)AlSiO·2HO with iron, calcium, rubidium and potassium as common substituting elements. It is important as a significant ore of caesium and sometimes rubidium. It forms a solid solution series with analcime. It crystallizes in the isometric - hexoctahedral crystal system as colorless, white, gray, or rarely pink and blue masses. Well formed crystals are rare. It has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.9. It has a brittle fracture and no cleavage. - The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, HCrO of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent. - Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula HSO and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol. - Caesium or cesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold (or, according to some, silver/colorless) alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at 116 °C (177 °F). It is the least electronegative element. It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite, while the radioisotopes, especially caesium-137, a fission product, are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors. - Rust is an iron oxide, usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides FeO·\\"n\\"HO and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)). - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - Caesium chromate , the caesium salt of chromic acid , is used to produce caesium vapour by reaction with silicon , boron , or titanium , which is used to in the final stages of creating vacuum tubes ; the caesium vapour reacts with the remaining gases , including nitrogen and oxygen . - Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). - Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin \\"\\", derived from the Greek \\"\\" (literally \\"shiny\\" or \\"white\\"), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *\\"her-\\", \\"grey\\" or \\"shining\\". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\\"native silver\\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is more abundant than gold, but it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \\"0.940 fine\\". - Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine. - Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam. - Aqua regia (\\"royal water\\" or \\"king's water\\") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid. Aqua regia was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum. However, aqua regia does not dissolve or corrode silver, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, rhenium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, osmium, or rhodium. - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust. - Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with an atomic mass of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive Rb, with a half-life of 49 billion yearsmore than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe. - Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free (elemental) state. - Borax, also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate, is an important boron compound, a mineral, and a salt of boric acid. Powdered borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water. - Kernite, also known as rasorite is a hydrated sodium borate hydroxide mineral with formula . It is a colorless to white mineral crystallizing in the monoclinic crystal system typically occurring as prismatic to acicular crystals or granular masses. It is relatively soft with Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and light with a specific gravity of 1.91. It exhibits perfect cleavage and a brittle fracture.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Background: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland. Paragraph: Two oceans have divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floor. The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock? The answer is:","completion":"The Arctic Ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock compared to the Pacific Ocean. This is because the Arctic Ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific Ocean has seven active diverging tectonic plates under its waters. The higher number of active divergent plate boundaries in the Pacific Ocean leads to more volcanic activity, and thus, increased cooling and solidification of hot molten rock, forming new oceanic crust.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. For just under five minutes on Saturday, England’s supporters found their voice. With Springbok lock Victor Matfield in the sin bin, Stuart Lancaster’s side finally gave the 82,125 fans inside Twickenham hope with two tries to level the score at 20-20. Swing Low echoed around the rain-soaked old stadium but they had barely got through the first verse before it all went flat again. Just as the power failed before the match, the lights went out on England’s momentarily sparky performance. With Matfield still off, the hulking Schalk Burger muscled his way over in the right-hand corner and South Africa never looked back. VIDEO Scroll down to see where Stuart Lancaster feels England lost the game. England captain Chris Robshaw's emotion shows what the loss, their fifth successive, means to the England players. England's players look dejected as they trudge off the Twickenham turf following their defeat on Saturday. South Africa players celebrate the only try of the first half which came from an intercept by Jan Serfontein. England: Brown, Watson, Barritt, Eastmond, May, Farrell , Care; Marler, Hartley, Wilson, Attwood, Lawes, Wood, Robshaw (c), Vunipola. Replacements: Webber, Mullan, Brookes, Kruis, Morgan, Youngs, Ford, Yarde. Tries: Wilson, Morgan, Barritt. Penalties: Farrell (2), Ford.

Another consolation try seconds from time put gloss on the scoreboard but, make no mistake, for large parts of this game England were abject. If the alarm bells were ringing following defeat to the All Blacks, the sirens are screaming from the Twickenham rooftops after this loss. Five defeats in succession, albeit against the best two sides in the world, is England’s worst run since 2006. And as the countdown to the World Cup continues, there is no sign of significant improvement. For the second week running, an opposition No7 — this time Burger — won the man-of-the-match award, leaving more questions over England captain Chris Robshaw’s suitability for the openside role. For the second week running, England were second best at the breakdown. For the second week running, Owen Farrell was unable to spark his back line. For the second week running, the scoreboard told a false story. England created next to nothing when South Africa had a full complement on the field. On the few occasions they did, they bombed their chances. The first 15 minutes were truly dire with balls regularly spilled in slippery, but far from treacherous, handling conditions against a side who tackled fiercely, sat back and waited for their chances to come. And come they did. Before England knew it, they were 10-0 down and they were lucky to reach half time at 13-6. That became 20-6 just after the break when Cobus Reinach crossed for a brilliantly worked try before England briefly rallied with Matfield in the bin. But with momentum swinging, Burger and co wrestled control back and closed out the game. England had few answers. Lancaster said: ‘We got some good field position in the second half and took those chances well. In the first half we could have been a bit smarter in those conditions. It was one of those days when territory was going to be important and in the first half South Africa benefited from our errors. Springboks centre Jan Serfontein runs away for the first try of the match after intercepting the pass of Danny Care. England's Kyle Eastmond takes on South Africa's Pat Lambie as the centre makes his full international debut. Springboks' forwards engulf England's Billy Vunipola after he takes the ball from a lineout. Owen Farrell adds two points after the try of Wilson to make his tally two penalties and two conversions before being replaced. A break from England full back Mike Brown is halted by try-scorer Serfontein. South Africa celebrate Cobus Reinach's first international try in his first start for the Springboks in the first minute of the second half.

Substituted after 43 minutes, the young Saracen can rarely have produced a more error-strewn display. Ben Morgan will surely start next week if the strike-threatened clash with Samoa goes ahead. Almost as soon as Vunipola was replaced by Morgan, England found some bite. Two tries in three minutes from the industrious David Wilson and then from Morgan himself gave England’s fans hope. But like so many times under Stuart Lancaster’s reign, the home side flattered to deceive, lacking the nous to beat one of the Southern Hemisphere’s big three. Just as New Zealand did last week, South Africa gripped this game at precisely the right time. Once again England were strangled as discipline disappeared and attacking quality went missing. Dylan Hartley was sent to the bin for a cynical 61st-minute stamp on Duane Vermeulen, which could easily have brought a red card from referee Steve Walsh. As it was, the yellow compounded his side’s woes and undid a lot of excellent work from England’s hooker. Indeed, most concerning for England’s coaches is that despite the set-piece being rock solid, they are failing to create chances and field position on the back of it. England out-scrummaged their opponents with ease in an area the Springboks would have expected to dominate. England’s lineout functioned well again, with Courtney Lawes enjoying a fine game in tandem with his Northampton team-mate Hartley. So what on earth is going wrong? Victor Matfield was shown a yellow card after collapsing a maul following warnings to both sides by referee Steve Walsh. Mike Brown takes a high ball and is tackled in the air by South Africa's full back Willie Le Roux. England full back Brown pushes his South African counterpart Le Roux. David Wilson crosses for England as the hosts make South Africa pay following the sin-binning of South Africa's Matfield. England's Ben Morgan twists in the tackle to get the ball down for England's second try. Another try for the England forwards comes from Morgan as the home side make the most of the one-man advantage. 1) Losing the breakdown battle. Must generate quick ball for the backs. if you won’t use them?2) Talented wingers are isolated. Why pick them. 3) Kicking game needs improvement. No territory means no points. 4) Missed chances. England must start taking the few they’re creating. 5) Talk straight. Some home truths need telling behind closed doors. In his first start on the right wing, Anthony Watson hardly touched the ball while Jonny May was also criminally underused on the other flank. England’s much-criticised kicking game was barely any better on Saturday, with Farrell unable to manoeuvre his forwards around the pitch and lacking the passing game to get the back line moving. The England No10 was completely outshone by his opposite man Pat Lambie, who kicked 16 points including a late drop goal and pulled the strings superbly for his side. Scrum-half Danny Care was ponderous around the breakdown as England’s back row were dominated and the quick ball backs desperately crave to attack the gain-line never materialised.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Jonah or Jonas is the name given in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh/Old Testament) to a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE. He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. Jonah is regarded as a saint by a number of Christian denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the Martyrologium Romanum. In Catholicism, the Book of Jonah is also read aloud in its entirety on Maundy Thursday in a Beneventan chant. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian calendar; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern Gregorian calendar). In the Armenian Apostolic Church, moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the Twelve Minor Prophets. Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the Fast of Nineveh in Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church on 22 September. Christian theologians have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a type for Jesus Christ. Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of Jesus's crucifixion and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for Jesus's resurrection. Saint Jerome equates Jonah with Jesus's more nationalistic side, and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that \\"Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people.\\" Other Christian interpreters, including Saint Augustine and Martin Luther, have taken a directly opposite approach, regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people. Luther likewise concludes that the kikayon represents Judaism, and that the worm which devours it represents Christ. Luther's antisemitic interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history. J. D. Michaelis comments that \\"the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes\\", and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against \\"the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth.\\" Albert Eichhorn was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation. John Calvin and John Hooper regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God. While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah, Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt. Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of Hell, intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness. Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story, describing the sailors on the boat as \\"hard and iron-hearted, like Cyclops\\", the penitence of the Ninevites as \\"untrained\\", and the king of Nineveh as a \\"novice\\". Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the archetypal dissident and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state. Hooper deplores such dissidents, decrying: \\"Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Which denominations are these?","completion":"The denominations mentioned in the article are Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Armenian Apostolic Church, Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Get to know each student one-on-one. Your classroom may include students who have some disability and students who have none, and specific disabilities may vary among students who face them. To promote an inclusive environment, you'll need to know which needs exist and must be met. Keep in mind that no two disabled students are the same. Some disabilities exist on a spectrum (such as varying degrees of low vision), and others are extremely complex (such as autism). Talking to the parents/guardians, and getting to know the child, will help you understand their unique needs. Recognize that not all disabilities may be diagnosed yet. Sometimes, people close to the child haven't recognized that the child is different or struggling. You may have several students with unrecognized disabilities. Don't assume that you can defeat or cure disability. Instead, work with the child at their level, and encourage them to gain skills one step at a time. You'll need to use the right tools if you want to meet the needs of students in your classroom. A physical environment that is somehow “off limits” to some of your students will make it impossible for those students to learn or feel welcome. The exact tools will vary based on students' needs. For instance, students with vision impairments may need materials in large print or Braille. Those with speech impairments may benefit from speech synthesizers. Those with hearing impairments may need a sign language interpreter and subtitled instructional videos. Some students will have needs that are not immediately obvious. For instance, some autistic students may have a sensitivity to light and sound, so rooms with soft light and minimal noise create a preferred learning environment. Unfortunately, even well-meaning individuals can end up labeling disabled students by their disabilities. Instead of fixating on the things your students cannot do, focus on your students' abilities and individual accomplishments. Viewing disabled students with pity or guilt does not empower them. Instead, you may accidentally send the message that they are less capable or less whole. Mean-spirited assumptions aren't the only hazardous ones to watch out for. In fact, well-intended assumptions can be just as damaging and might be harder to prevent. If one of your students appears to need help with something, ask instead of automatically jumping in to help. Some students may prefer to work through certain difficulties themselves. Others may appreciate your help, but may also want you to help using an approach you may not have thought of. Language is important when creating the right attitude. As a general rule, use language that affirms the identity of each student while avoiding language that is considered derogatory or language that otherwise focuses on the disability instead of the individual. Refer to disabilities in simple language free from emotional judgments. In other words, instead of saying that someone \\"suffers from\\" or \\"is crippled by\\" a given disability, it would be better to simply state that they are \\"a person with\\" that disability (or, in the case of deaf, blind, or autistic people, a \\"_____ person\\"). Over-sensitivity can actually be harmful, too. Awkwardness over common phrases can draw unwanted attention to an impairment and may make a student feel more left out. If such phrases come up, it is best to gloss over them without making a fuss about them. For instance, if you or another student says \\"see you later\\" to a blind student, it is best not to point out the awkwardness of such a phrase unless the blind student indicates that they are upset by the remark. As the instructor, you must guide non-disabled students in your classroom as they interact with their disabled peers. Encourage a positive and cooperative attitude among all classmates under your care. Pay attention to your own biases and preconceptions, then correct those errors as soon as possible. You will serve as a role model to your students, and poor behavior you demonstrate will be taught to them. Set ground rules regarding discussion and classroom behavior. When someone violates these rules and behaves inappropriately to another student, point out the violation and issue an appropriate consequence. Follow through consistently regardless of whether or not disabled students are involved and, if so, regardless of which position they find themselves in (i.e., the attacker or the victim). Don't enforce rules with disabled students that non-disabled students can get away with breaking. Nip bullying in the bud. Make it clear that students need to respect others' boundaries, praise students for intervening if they see bullying, and take victims seriously if they report being bullied. In most cases, others will be actively involved in the care and education of the disabled students in your classroom. Work directly with these guardians, counselors, and advisers when addressing those students' needs. Discuss your students' needs with their guardians. You may have insight to share with them, and they will almost certainly have insight to share with you. Depending on the circumstances, students with disabilities may need therapy from an outside specialist. These specialists may work through the school or may come from another source. Either way, it can be to everyone's benefit to communicate with such specialists when determining the best way to arrange classroom activities and instruction. Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing the unique needs of disabled students in an inclusive classroom environment, using appropriate tools and language, and promoting a positive, cooperative attitude among all students while working closely with guardians and specialists."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the premise \\"The demographic and economic assumptions imply a sharp drop in the average annual growth of aggregate hours worked from 0.7 percent through 2010 to 0.2 percent from 2020 through 2075.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Aggregate hours worked has only been decreasing for past decade.\\" is true?","completion":"To evaluate if the hypothesis \\"Aggregate hours worked has only been decreasing for the past decade\\" is true, based on the premise \\"The demographic and economic assumptions imply a sharp drop in the average annual growth of aggregate hours worked from 0.7 percent through 2010 to 0.2 percent from 2020 through 2075,\\" we need to analyze the hypothesis in the context of the given premises and consider possible factors involved in the change in aggregate hours worked. 1. Premise interpretation: The premise states that there is a decrease in the annual growth rate of aggregate hours worked, not necessarily that the actual aggregate hours worked itself is decreasing. Here, we see a change in the growth rate, from a higher growth rate of 0.7% through 2010, to a lower growth rate of 0.2% from 2020 through 2075. 2. Factors affecting aggregate hours worked: To deduce whether the premise implies that the aggregate hours worked is decreasing in the past decade, we need to first understand the factors affecting it. Some major factors include population growth, employment rate, working-age population, and average hours worked per worker. 3. Changes in factors: If all the factors remain constant or show a positive trend, a slower growth rate in aggregate hours worked implies that the hours worked might still be increasing, but at a less rapid pace. For instance, a steady or growing population with a stable employment rate can still contribute to an increasing total hours worked. It is also possible that technological advancements and increased productivity compensates for a lower growth rate in aggregate hours worked, maintaining or even increasing the output achieved in the economy. 4. Effect of the given assumptions: The premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the aggregate hours worked are actually decreasing over the past decade. The drop in growth rate could imply a slower pace of increase in the aggregate hours worked, but does not necessarily mean a decrease. Thus, considering the factors affecting aggregate hours worked and the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"Aggregate hours worked has only been decreasing for the past decade\\" is true. The premise only discusses the change in growth rate and not whether the aggregate hours worked are declining. Further clarification and data on the factors involved, such as demographic changes and economic performance during this period, would be needed to determine whether the hypothesis holds true or not."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

An excellent example of \\"cowboy noir\\", as it's been called, in which unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses out on a job because he insists on being honest (he's got a bum leg). With really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he's going to lie. When he walks into a bar, and the owner Wayne (the late, great J.T. Walsh) mistakes him for a hit-man whom Wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in fine form), Michael plays along and accepts Waynes' money. *Then* he goes to Suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions, and accepts *her* money to get rid of Wayne!

Input: [[-27, -29, 19, -43, 9], [-35, -10, -27], [-22, -22, -42, 11, 29], [40, -34, -41], [-41, 2], [-46, 35, 45, -5, -21]] Output:","completion":"In this task, you are given a list of lists containing integers. Your goal is to create a new list with the same length as the number of lists in the input list, where each element is the result of multiplying all even numbers from its corresponding inner list in the input list. If there are no even numbers in an inner list, you should place 0 in the output list. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what you need to do: 1. Create an empty list called \`output\` that will store the final results. 2. Go through each inner list in the input list. a. Initialize a variable called \`product\` and set its value to 1. b. Go through each number in the inner list. - If the number is even (i.e., evenly divisible by 2), multiply the \`product\` by that number. c. After going through all numbers in the inner list, check if the \`product\` is still 1. If it is, this means there were no even numbers, so you should set the \`product\` to 0. d. Append the \`product\` to the \`output\` list. 3. When you have gone through all inner lists and calculated the product of even numbers for each, the \`output\` list should contain the correct results.

News article: Mayor Ed Lee (D) announces ban on public funding of city employee travel North Carolina law prohibits local laws against LGBT discrimination New policy includes exception for \\"absolutely essential\\" matters Bloomberg/Getty Images San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee (D) sent a strong message to North Carolina on Friday. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee (D) is barring public funding for city employees’ travel to North Carolina in protest of the state’s new law prohibiting localities from passing legislation to protect LGBT rights. “We are standing united as San Franciscans to condemn North Carolina’s new discriminatory law that turns back the clock on protecting the rights of all Americans including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals,” Lee said in a Friday statement announcing the ban. The mayor specified, however, that there would be an exception for travel that is “absolutely essential to public health and safety.” The North Carolina legislature passed a law on Wednesday that prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, country of origin, age or “biological sex,” but deliberately excludes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. It also barred municipalities in the state from passing their own laws against LGBT discrimination. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) promoted the law in part by stoking fears that laws against transgender discrimination would effectively allow men to prey on women in the bathroom. It is not clear how often the city of San Francisco paid for trips to North Carolina, but the effort carries symbolic weight. The mayor’s move is part of a growing wave of governments and businesses trying to penalize the state for enabling anti-LGBT discrimination. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who has fought state-level anti-LGBT laws across the country, has said he will enlist the help of the CEO of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America in an effort to overturn the law. PayPal, Dow Chemical, the NCAA, NBA and Google have come out against the law. Lee indicated that San Francisco’s travel boycott is intended to serve as a warning to other states. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Lee said in a statement Friday that residents in the city with a large gay and lesbian population \\"will not subsidize legally sanctioned discrimination.\\" He says the new law turns back the clock on civil rights protections. North Carolina Gov. Pat McGrory signed legislation this week voiding a Charlotte ordinance that would have allowed transgender people to legally use restrooms aligned with their gender identity.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

The main entities involved in determining these rules are the Indian Constitution, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), and various service-specific rules and guidelines. 1. Indian Constitution: The Constitution of India forms the foundation for the rules and regulations governing All India Services recruitment. Article 312 of the Indian Constitution defines the All India Services and empowers the Parliament to create new services and modify existing ones. Furthermore, Article 320 provides for the establishment of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which serves as the central recruiting agency for these services. 2. Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT): The DoPT, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions, is responsible for formulating policies and managing the recruitment process for the All India Services. The DoPT issues guidelines, rules, and regulations concerning the selection process, training, and cadre allocation for successful candidates. 3. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC): As a constitutional body, UPSC is responsible for conducting examinations and selecting candidates for All India Services. The UPSC is tasked to ensure the selection process is fair, transparent, and merit-based. It formulates examination rules, including eligibility criteria, age limit, educational qualifications, exam pattern, and reservation policies. 4. Service-Specific Rules and Guidelines: Each All India Service has its own specific rules and guidelines, laid down by the concerned Ministry or Department, which govern aspects like probation, seniority, promotion, and cadre allocation. These rules are revised periodically to reflect changes in policy and requirements. The recruitment process for All India Services consists of the following key stages: a. Civil Services Examination (CSE): UPSC conducts the CSE annually, which is a three-tier examination consisting of the Preliminary, Main, and Personality Test/Interview. Candidates who qualify the prelims go on to take the mains exams, following which those who clear the cutoff marks are summoned for a personality test or interview. b. Cadre Allocation: Based on the rank and preference of the candidates, as well as government guidelines on reservation policy, cadre allocation takes place. Candidates are allocated to different states and services like IAS, IPS, and IFoS. c. Training: Successful candidates undergo an extensive training program, first at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) for a foundation course, followed by specific service-related training at respective academies (e.g., Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy for IPS officers). d. Probation and Confirmation: After completing their training, officers are posted to various locations on probation. Upon successful completion of the probation period, they are confirmed in their respective services. The rules of recruitment for All India Services are designed to ensure a fair, transparent, and merit-based system that selects the best candidates to serve the nation. It is continuously reassessed and modified to meet the changing needs and expectations of the country and its people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A: Options are: (I). rain (II). chloride (III). lipoic (IV). pyruvic Answer:","completion":"In alcoholic fermentation, the acid that changes to alcohol and carbon dioxide is pyruvic acid (IV). Alcoholic fermentation is a biological process carried out by yeasts and some other microorganisms, which involves breaking down sugars like glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process is anaerobic, meaning it occurs without oxygen. It is utilized in industries such as brewing, winemaking, and baking, and has been essential to human civilization for thousands of years. The process of alcoholic fermentation starts with the glycolysis pathway. Glycolysis is a series of metabolic reactions that convert glucose—a six-carbon sugar—into two molecules of pyruvate, a three-carbon compound, with a net gain of 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules (both of which are important energy carriers). The pyruvate generated during glycolysis is the crucial component that undergoes fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation consists of two primary reactions: 1. Decarboxylation: First, pyruvic acid undergoes decarboxylation, a chemical reaction where a carbon atom is removed from a molecule, forming carbon dioxide as a byproduct. In this case, the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase removes a carboxyl group (COOH) from pyruvic acid, producing acetaldehyde and releasing carbon dioxide. 2. Reduction: Following decarboxylation, the acetaldehyde is reduced to ethanol, an alcohol. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. During this reduction, the two NADH molecules generated previously in glycolysis are used, transferring electrons and protons to acetaldehyde and converting it into ethanol. This process also regenerates NAD+, which is needed for glycolysis to continue. In summary, during alcoholic fermentation, it is pyruvic acid (IV) that changes into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process is essential in the production of alcoholic beverages, like beer and wine, and contributes to the leavening of dough in breadmaking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's a cliche of American presidential politics -- the president we elect is always a reaction to what came before. As in: Nixonian shenanigans eventually gave rise to Jimmy Carter's self-righteousness. Clintonesque parsing gave way to George W. Bush's plain speaking. Bush's plain speaking begat Barack Obama's lofty speechifying. Oversimplified? Yes. But true nonetheless. And so we head into 2016 (yes, already) and Chris Christie's ready-made narrative: If Obama is lofty, Christie is down to earth. If Obama wasn't tough enough, he's hard-hitting. If Obama couldn't run his complex health care rollout, he's a strong manager. If Obama was partisan, he's worked across party lines. In sum: Christie can lead in the precise ways that Obama disappointed. Until a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge. Then came another stark contrast: the vindictive -- and more important, petty -- Christie culture as opposed to the stature the presidency demands. So far, the New Jersey melodrama looks like the worst side of the Christie ethos. The apparent reprisals against Democratic mayors. The vanity of featuring the Christie family in taxpayer-funded commercials. The environment in which retribution reigned when Christie did not get what he wanted. The arrogance of believing he was deserving of it all, and to hell with the rest of 'em. The grand storyline behind all of this, of course, is the design on the presidency: Christie wanted to be re-elected by such an overwhelming margin that it would launch his national aspirations into the stratosphere. The plan was to get bipartisan support to show his viability as a national candidate. All who stood in the way were official enemies. This is not to say that presidents don't have enemies. Of course they do. You don't get elected to any office in this country, much less president of the United States, without accumulating political enemies. But the real question is WHY you consider someone an enemy, and then, how you deal with it. As president, LBJ had always had a bunch, but the enmity -- and payback -- generally came over issues, not self-aggrandizement. It's Politics 101: If you want to pass a civil rights bill and you don't get a \\"yes\\" vote from an opponent who wants a bridge in his state, no bridge. That's very different from saying if you don't endorse my candidacy I will shut down your bridge. That's not politics; it's puny payback. And, worse, the impact is felt not only by the opponent, but by his -- and your -- constituents. A bridge way too far. Then consider Bill Clinton, who had plenty of enemies. A former senior Clinton adviser reminds me that \\"it became a joke that the best thing to be was Clinton's enemy. If 99 people in a room were for him, and one was against him, he would spend all his time trying to persuade that one guy he was wrong. And he was always willing to argue the substance. Always. In fact, he enjoyed it.\\" This is not to turn Clinton and LBJ into saintly role models and Christie into the devil. But it is to say that Christie's staff shenanigans -- which he says he did not know about -- have raised enormous questions about his temperament and how he would run a White House. In fact, a Monmouth University poll released this week shows that only 44% of New Jersey voters believe that their governor has the right temperament for the Oval Office. The characterization of Christie and Obama as opposite numbers is accurate in many ways. There's this: When then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democrat-turned-independent, endorsed Republican Sen. John McCain for the presidency in 2008 -- and became his outspoken travel buddy -- there were calls for retribution after Obama won. So what did Obama do? He kept Lieberman on as chairman of an important committee. It kept an enemy close, not a bad strategy. Obama is cool and Christie is all drama. And now a line of argument against him as petty and vindictive has been opened up that will become the default narrative. But Christie will be defined as much by how he deals with this episode as the episode itself. No one expects -- or really wants -- Chris Christie to morph into a false version of himself. But how about some elevation -- and some perspective -- that flies way above the traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge?

Unfortunately, my experience was far from the exceptional dining experience I had anticipated. At first glance, the restaurant's decor is lovely and inviting, but upon closer inspection, the cleanliness leaves much to be desired. While it wasn't enough to put me off entirely, it definitely dampened the ambiance. The real disappointment came when we ordered our appetizers and entrees. It took more than 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive, and when they did, the food was lackluster. The shrimp cocktail tasted rubbery and the accompanying sauce was bland. I also found a hair in my Caesar salad, which was promptly replaced by the staff, but nevertheless made me question the cleanliness of the kitchen. The main courses were similarly disappointing. My filet mignon was overly salty and cooked past the medium-rare I had requested. My date's vegetarian dish was a tasteless medley of undercooked vegetables drowning in a pool of watery sauce. Service was another area where The Fancy Fork fell short. Our server was absent most of the time, making it difficult to request refills of water or inquire about our food's long wait times. This, combined with the high price tag of our disappointing meals, left us feeling unsatisfied. In the end, it is difficult to recommend The Fancy Fork, especially with so many other great dining options nearby.

Teens may look like young adults but their brain structure is similar to that of much younger children. \\"It is not always easy for teens to pay attention in class without letting their minds wander, or to ignore distractions from their younger brothers or sisters when trying to solve a maths problem,\\" said Dr Iroise Dumon-theil. \\"But it's not the fault of teenagers that they can't pay attention and are easily distracted.

The hits just keep coming for MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, the Obamacare architect under fire for his controversial statements about the health care reform law. Video unearthed today by veteran White House reporter Keith Koffler shows Gruber agreeing that states' opposition to the Medicaid expansion dictated by the federal health law may be race-related. He also claimed states that rejected federal funds for Medicaid wanted 'to punish poor people,' which he said 'really is just almost awesome in its evilness.' The video released by Koffler on his news site, White House Dossier, is the latest in a series of damning videos of Gruber talking about the health care law that have popped up online recently. The comments have top Democrats, including President Barack Obama, disavowing both him and his claims. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. In this March photo Economist Jonathan Gruber is seen speaking at a conference of the Workers Compensation Research Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. Gruber is a professor at MIT and the architect of the healthcare reform laws in Massachusetts and the Affordable Care Act. He's taken fire over recently over comments he made about the latter. In previously released videos, the economist stated that the health care law 'was written in a tortured way' to ensure that the Congressional Budget Office did not label the individual mandate portion of the law as a tax. 'If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. Okay, so it’s written to do that,' he said during an academic panel in 2013. 'In terms of risk rated subsidies, if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in – you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed… Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,' he continued. He then told the audience they could blame the 'stupidity of the American voter' for not seeing through Democratic spin. I wish 'we could make it all transparent, but I’d rather have this law than not,' he concluded. The video that emerged today features Gruber and the University of Chicago's Harold Pollack discussing the Obamacare Medicaid expansion on behalf of the website healthinsurance.org in April of this year. At one point in the conversation Pollack states that there's 'a politics of impunity towards poor people, particularly non-white poor people... it’s almost a feature rather than a bug in the internal politics in some of these states, not to cover people under Medicaid even if it’s financially very advantageous to do so.' Pollack goes on to say that it's an 'important principle to defeat' politically 'because it’s such a toxic political perspective.' 'It has to be shown that that approach to politics doesn’t work, because otherwise we will really be stuck with some very unjust policies that will be pursued with complete impunity in some of these places,' he said. To which Gruber replied, 'You know, that’s a great way to put it: There’s larger principles at stake here, when these states are not just turning down covering the poor people, but turning down the federal stimulus that would come with that. 'They’re not just not interested in covering poor people, they’re willing to sacrifice billions of dollars in injections into their economy in order to punish poor people. I mean, it really is just almost awesome in its evilness. And I agree, you have to recognize there’s larger principles at stake here.' Left unsaid in the discussion was that the states that rejected the Medicaid expansion and the federal dollars that came with it in the short term were steered in that direction by Republicans in the state legislature or in the governor's mansion. At a press conference during the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, last weekend President Barack Obama put as much distance between himself and Gruber as possible, arguing that the Obamacare consultant was never on staff at the White House. The White House has already addressed Gruber's other defamatory statements, with Obama spokesman Josh Earnest saying last week that he 'vigorously' disagrees with the 'stupidity' claim. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Sunday morning on Twitter that Gruber is the one who's stupid. 'As one who worked hard to make ACA and its benefits clear, let me say: if you looked up \\"stupid\\" in dictionary, you'd find Gruber's picture,' he wrote. And at a press conference this weekend in Brisbane, Australia, over the weekend, Obama made it clear to reporters that Gruber does not speak for his administration. 'The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run,' Obama said. 'I would just advise every press outlet here: Pull up every clip and every story. I think it’s fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent,' Obama said. 'It was a tough debate.' While it is true that Gruber, who claims he 'helped write' Obamacare, never served on the White House staff, records show that the Health and Human Services Department paid him 392,600 consulting fees during the time the Affordable Care Act was being drawn up. The economics professor's 'Gruber Microsimulation Model' aided the White House with estimations of how different aspects of the plan would be scored by CBO and whether it would consider affiliated costs taxes. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also tried to disassociate herself from the Obamacare consultant last week by claiming to not even 'know who he is.' In the next breath she claimed that, 'he didn't help write our bill.' That directly contradicts a 2011 claim from Gruber that 'helped design the reform' as well as 'implement' it. Likewise, he said he 'was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details as well.' A March 2012 New York Times article also credits him with that work. 'After Mr. Gruber helped the administration put together the basic principles of the proposal, the White House lent him to Capitol Hill to help Congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation,' the article says. After video surfaced of Pelosi citing Gruber at a Nov. 5, 2009 press conference her office was forced to back track slightly, telling the Washington Post that she 'meant that she didn't know Gruber personally.' 'She said she doesn’t \\"know who he is,\\" not that she’s \\"never heard of him,\\" ' Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill said. Facet-checking website Politifact rated her claim as false however, pointing to the press conference incident as evidence that she did in fact know who Gruber was before the unflattering videos became national news. 'Even if the latter is true, that’s not what she said at the press conference, so we rate her claim False,' it said in a piece dissecting her statements.

A long-lost Orson Welles film has finally had its U.S. premiere some 75 years after the unfinished silent movie was produced by the cinema genius. Too Much Johnson, which pre-dates his masterpiece debut Orson Welles, was recently discovered in an Italian warehouse and had its first ever American screening in Rochester, New York on October 16. The. film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a William Gillette. play and stars Joseph Cotten - who was to collaborate with Welles again. in the 1941 Citizen Kane and again in 1949's The Third Man. The play opened without the film in August 1938 and flopped. Scroll down for video. Welles made the silent slapstick comedy in New York City shortly before heading to Hollywood to film Citizen Kane, considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made. Welles died in 1985 and believed that the only remaining copy of the film had burned up in a 1970 fire that had destroyed his home in Spain. The U.S. screening took place at the Dryden Theater at the George Eastman House, where experts restored the 35 mm nitrate work print of the film. The U.S. screening took place at the Dryden Theater at the George Eastman House, where experts restored the 35 mm nitrate work print of the film. Italian film archivists announced in August that a copy of 'Too Much Johnson originally believed destroyed in a fire had been found in a box by a shipping company in Pordenone, a northeastern Italian city that's home to the Le Giornate del Cinema Muto silent film festival where the film had it global premier earlier this month. The film was turned over to a local film society, but the find seemed of no particular value and was left unopened for many years. Circo Giorgini, an Italian expert on Welles, identified the film about three years ago. The only remaining copy was believed to have been burned up in a 1970 fire that destroyed Welles' home in Madrid, Spain. Welles died in 1985. How the film arrived in Pordenone remains a mystery. The film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a William Gillette play, but the play opened without the film in August 1938 and flopped. Film accompaniment: Orson Welles wanted his 40-minute, three-act film to be prologues for the three acts of a William Gillette play he was putting on at the Mercury Theater. 'This is by far the most important film restoration by George Eastman House in a very long time,' said Paolo Cherchi Usai, senior curator of film, who supervised the project. 'Holding in one's hands the very same print that had been personally edited by Orson Welles 75 years ago provokes an emotion that's just impossible to describe.' Welles made the silent slapstick comedy in New York City shortly before heading to Hollywood to film Citizen Kane, considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made. Too Much Johnson, filmed in 1938, has nowhere near the complexity of Kane or the tense thrills of The Third Man but offers a never-before-seen glimpse at the skills of one of cinema's greats. It had never been shown in public and. was at one time lost to Welles himself, who expressed his shock at. finding a copy in storage at his home near Madrid, Spain. It. was this copy of the film, which most experts agreed was the only copy,. that was destroyed in a fire at Welles's home in the 1970s. The film was designed to run for 40 minutes, with 20 minutes devoted to the play's prologue and two 10-minute introductions for the second and third act. But a virtually pristine print was recently discovered in an Italian warehouse, and has now been restored by George Eastman House. The film was not intended to stand by. itself, but was designed as the cinematic aspect of Welles's Mercury. Theater stage presentation of William Gillette's 1894 comedy. The play follows the fortunes of a New. York playboy who flees from the violent husband of his mistress and. borrows the identity of a plantation owner in Cuba - who is expecting the. arrival of a mail-order bride. The film was designed to run for 40 minutes, with. 20 minutes devoted to the play's prologue and two 10-minute. introductions for the second and third act. Welles wanted it to be a. silent film in the tradition of the Mack Sennett slapstick comedies, in. order to enhance the various chases, duels and comic conflicts of the. Gillette play. In addition - and typical of Welles's innovation - live music and live sound effects would be synchronized with the footage to provide a 'surround sound' effect for the audience. But the film was never fully. finished. It was anticipated that the play would be a flop and Welles. let the film project die a natural death, putting the footage in. storage. He recalled in a. later interview that he was surprised to find a copy at his home,. saying: 'I can't remember whether I had it all along and dug it out of. the bottom of a trunk, or whether someone brought it to me, but there it. was. Long-time collaboration: The unseen film stars Joseph Cotten - seen here with Welles in 1949's The Third Man. Welles himself said Cotten's performance was amazing, but nonetheless did not want the film shown publicly. Masterpiece: Citizen Kane - the 1941 film written, directed by and starring Orson Welles - is widely regarded as the best film ever made. 'I screened it, and it was in perfect. condition, with not a scratch on it, as though it had only been through. a projector once or twice before. It had a fine quality. 'Cotten was magnificent, and I immediately made plans to edit it and send it to Joe as a birthday present.'. But Welles never allowed the footage to be seen publicly, stating the film would not make sense outside of the full context of the Gillette play. The recent copy was found in a warehouse by the staff of Pordenone arthouse Cinemazero. Other Mercury Theater actors that appear in the film include Eustace Wyatt, Edgar Barrier, Ruth Ford, Arlene Francis, Mary Wickes, Welles himself and his wife Virginia Nicholson. The play opened without the film on August 16, 1938 - and flopped. The unfinished nitrate work print was given by Cinemazero to Italian film archive Cineteca del Friuli, which transferred it to George Eastman House to be preserved with a grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation. Paolo Cherchi Usai, senior curator of film, who supervised the project for George Eastman House, said: 'This is by far the most important film restoration by George Eastman House in a very long time. Holding in one’s hands the very same print that had been personally edited by Orson Welles 75 years ago provokes an emotion that’s just impossible to describe.' Despite the fact that it pre-dates Citizen Kane, even Too Much Johnson is not Welles's directorial debut. In 1934, while still attending The Todd School for. Boys, he co-directed (with friend William Vance) a short avant garde. film called The Hearts Of Age.

Movie plot title: Sphere Movie plot: Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) is called to a location in the Pacific Ocean, for what he thinks is a plane crash. His specialty is psychiatry and dealing with crash survivors. The helicopter pilot (Huey Lewis - yes THAT Huey Lewis!) tells him they've been ferrying all kinds of scientists to this location.Onboard a naval ship, Norman sees astrophysicist Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schriber) and biochemist Dr. Beth Halperin (Sharon Stone), but is unable to talk to them. The ship's captain, Harold Barnes (Peter Coyote) briefs them - the plane crash is a spacecraft, a huge ship buried under 300 years of coral. In addition to Beth, Norman and Ted, mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson) is also on the contact team, which was recommended by Norman many years ago.The team goes through a medical examination, and a dive briefing by an instructor (James Pickens Jr.), who tells them there is \\"no quick return to the surface\\". The team takes a sub to the crash site habitat, and they all begin to exhibit signs of nervousness. It's clear that Norman and Beth have some history. The habitat is manned by Edmunds (Marga Gomez) and Alice Fletcher (Queen Latifah), who is directing a Navy dive team to set up a drone by the ship's door.The team puts on dive suits and walks on the seafloor to the spacecraft, and the door opens for them. Beth sees footprints in the dust, and Barnes splits them into 2 groups. Beth and Norman step onto an elevator, which takes them to the bridge.

Summarize this article: (CNN) For Agness Jonathan, every day is a gamble with her children's lives. Simple questions like whether they should go to school carry an unimaginable risk of death and dismemberment to satisfy a barbaric demand. This is because her daughters are living with albinism, a genetic condition resulting in little or no pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. And this makes them a target. Living in fear It is children like Agness' who, according to a newly released Amnesty International report , are being hunted like animals in Malawi where their bones are sold in the belief the body parts bring wealth, happiness and good luck. The report chronicles the day-to-day lives of those living with the condition, and details the extent of a recent surge in killings of albinos living in the landlocked country in southern Africa. The bloodiest month was April this year, when Amnesty says four people were murdered, including a baby. One of the victims was 17-year-old Davis Fletcher Machinjiri, who left his home to watch a soccer game with a friend, but never returned. The Malawian police say he was abducted by \\"about four men who trafficked him to Mozambique and killed him.\\" Describing his gruesome death, they say \\"the men chopped off both his arms and legs and removed bones. They then buried the rest of his body in a shallow grave.\\" Selling body parts JUST WATCHED Albino teen attacked for her body parts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Albino teen attacked for her body parts 02:57 Since 2014 at least 18 albinos have been killed, another five have been abducted and are still missing. And if it weren't for alert locals, Agness' youngest daughter Chakuputsa would be one of them. She was grabbed by three men while her mother was out working the fields. Agness describes how villagers chased after the men who eventually dumped the child in the bushes nearby. It turned out one of the attackers was a relative, someone, Agness tells Amnesty, she had considered like a brother. This, the community says, is all too common. Attackers are known to sell body parts to witchdoctors in Malawi and neighboring Mozambique, hoping to make quick money. Amnesty says \\"thousands of people with albinism are at severe risk of abduction and killing by individuals and criminal gangs,\\" while the United Nations warns that Malawi's albinos are at risk of \\"total extinction.\\" Grace Mazzah, a board member of the Association of People with Albinism in Malawi, is always aware of the price on her head. \\"It really raises fear,\\" she says. \\"Why should people hunt me like they're hunting for animals to eat?\\" ||||| They are taunted, hunted and mutilated. Over the past two years, at least 65 people with albinism have been attacked in Malawi - sometimes mutilated and dismembered alive by machete-wielding assailants. Amnesty International has documented what it calls \\"ritual killings\\" of people with albinism in Malawi. And on Tuesday, a Malawi newspaper said that \\"two days cannot pass without hearing on the local media cases of people with albinism being killed\\". Last week, a local activist told Al Jazeera that the situation is \\"a crisis\\". Albinism, a congenital disorder where people lack pigment in their skin, hair and eyes, affects about one in every 20,000 people. It is more common, however, in sub-Saharan Africa. There are an estimated 10,000 people with albinism in Malawi - a country of 16.5 million people. There have also been a number of attacks reported on people with albinism in Tanzania, Kenya and Burundi so far this year. Some in southern and eastern Africa believe that body parts belonging to people with albinism have magical powers, leading to them allegedly being sold on a black market run by criminal gangs across southern and central African countries. Last month, Ikponwosa Ero, a United Nations independent expert on human rights and albinism, said the community faced \\"systematic extinction\\". But, she says, this can be stopped. Al Jazeera: You recently said people with albinism in Malawi face systematic extinction. Ikponwosa Ero: I said that this will happen over time if nothing is done. The situation is a potent mix of poverty, witchcraft beliefs and market forces which push people to do things for profit. This is all happening in a context of long-term neglect of these people. There is a lack of understanding about people with albinism, not only in developing countries but also in developed nations. You find the albino trope used in movies where they are presented as supernatural beings or strange creatures or as idiotic. So when they bring in this lack of knowledge in the context of poverty, witchcraft beliefs and economic factors, you get a dangerous combination. This is what has led to this current situation. Al Jazeera: There seems to be a lot of money in this business. Ero: I say there is allegedly a lot of money in this business. And I say allegedly because people keep on repeating the idea that there is a lot of money in this, and it would seem that the media is part of the reason some people have gotten involved. People are like, \\"The media are reporting that body parts bring a lot of money, so it must be true\\", but it is allegedly. It could have some market value, which could explain why the attacks are happening. But then some countries have witnessed a reduction in the number of attacks, maybe because people are realising there is no value. There is a set of perplexing themes going on here. And this is why I say an in-depth study is really needed. But that being said, there are other indicators that seem to aggravate the attacks. Last year, for example, was an election year for many countries in the region and the attacks went up overall. This fed into the suspicion that powerful people are behind these attacks. The logic goes that powerful people go to witch doctors to win elections and to make money in their business. And witch doctors [might] say, \\"To get that, you need to do magic, have powerful potions with rare species of people or rare animals\\". This is how people with albinism become a target. So it's possible. I don't have concrete evidence, but given what happened last year, powerful people are involved, at least indirectly. We need to do more to get to the bottom of this. Al Jazeera: You have travelled across Malawi to meet people with albinism. How have the threats they face affected their ability to lead a normal life? Ero: What really struck me was how much fear they have. I guess you could imagine it but I saw it on their faces and heard it as they talked. I felt it myself. I felt scared being in the village and I couldn't wait to get back to my vehicle. I sensed the fear. And people should not be living like this. It is completely wrong. People said they did not know who to trust. People with albinism usually do well if their family look after or protect them. But when your protectors turn against you, or could turn against you, the fear goes to another level. Watching that play out was frightening. One lady told me about her son whose body was dug out from his grave 10 to 15 years after he was buried. It meant that someone close to the family knows that a person with albinism was buried there. How else would you find out? Another woman, who gave birth to a girl with albinism, has her sister harassing her and asking \\"Why did you have this baby?\\" Another man I met had survived an attack but has completely lost his mental balance. He can barely speak. There are others who say that having children with albinism means they cannot go to the farm because they have to protect them. As a result, they are struggling with even more poverty. The extent of the fear is high and the scope is very wide. Al Jazeera: We are talking about witch doctors, magical potions and mutilations in the context of the African continent, but how do we discuss these issues without raising other tropes about Africa? Ero: As the media, it's important to report on the issues, but its also important to try to humanise the story. Some journalists do that, but a lot of them do not, unfortunately. For instance, it's important to move away from the word \\"albino\\" to describe the community. Rather, it should be \\"people with albinism\\" because it puts the person before the condition, instead of equating them with it. They are not albinos, they are people. It's more humanising, like moving from \\"disabled\\" to \\"people with disabilities\\". So language is a key advocacy tool. It is also important to consider the facts. For instance, albinism exists in every race, every part of the world and in every gender. The frequency of occurrence varies: In the developed world, it's one in 17,000. In some places in Africa, it is one in 5,000, and in other places it is higher, like one in 1,000. Among aboriginal groups, in Panama or the south Pacific, it can be one in 70. When reporters say that body parts are sold, it is important to say \\"allegedly sold\\". There is no proof of this yet. Also, showcasing successful people with albinism will go a long way. AFRICA INVESTIGATES: The trade in body parts of people with albinism Al Jazeera: What is required for this issue to be taken seriously? Ero: This issue may be seen as another problem from the region, but the main difference is that this can be solved. We can focus resources and energy and elevate the issue for just a couple of years and the difference will be massive. Look at Kenya and Tanzania. They focused energies and there have been massive improvements. I think this is one of the human rights issues that is possible in a short to medium term. Not all the countries in the region are poor. It's a case of shifting priorities to make sure this issue gets the attention it needs. In countries like Malawi, currently struggling with an economic crisis, food crisis and drought, international aid should come forward to help. In Kenya, it was the government that took charge. In Tanzania, the people who took over were the aid agencies. The success in these countries illustrates how government and civil society can change this.

Process: - Sunlight shines on plants - Cells with chlorophyll in them capture the light energy - Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stoma - Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts of themselves - Plants absorb minerals through their roots - Plants convert these inputs into sugars - Sugars can be used as energy sources - Oxygen and water are also produced - Excess water and oxygen are released through stoma and other parts of the plant. Question: suppose more conversion into sugars happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If more conversion into sugars happens, there will be an increase in the production of sugar and oxygen in the plants. The perturbation of increased sugar conversion would have a direct impact on the creation of these energy sources and by-products. When plants receive more sunlight or have higher chlorophyll levels, there is an increased efficiency in the photosynthesis process. As a result, plants can capture more light energy and convert it into chemical energy, primarily in the form of sugars such as glucose. These sugars are then used by plants for growth, reproduction, and other essential functions. More conversion into sugars also means that more carbon dioxide will be absorbed by the plants during the process of photosynthesis since carbon dioxide is a vital input in the production of sugars. Consequently, the increased intake of carbon dioxide will lead to a higher rate of sugar production, and in turn, an increased rate of oxygen being produced as a by-product. The relationship between the production of sugar and the release of oxygen is directly proportional. In simple terms, if more sugar is being produced, then more oxygen will be generated as a result of the increased photosynthesis activity. This occurs because oxygen is released as a by-product when water molecules are split within the plant cells during the process of photosynthesis. So, in conclusion, if there is more conversion into sugars, it will have a positive effect on the production of both sugar and oxygen in plants. The increased sugar and oxygen production can then lead to improved plant growth, better resistance to environmental stresses, and enhanced overall ecosystem productivity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - The Krupp family (see pronunciation), a prominent 400-year-old German dynasty from Essen, have become famous for their production of steel, artillery, ammunition, and other armaments. The family business, known as Friedrich Krupp AG, was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. It was important to weapons development and production in both world wars. One of the most powerful dynasties in European history, for 400 years Krupp flourished as the premier weapons manufacturer for Germany. From the Thirty Years' War until the end of the Second World War, they produced everything from battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities. - A railway gun, also called a railroad gun, is a large artillery piece, often surplus naval artillery, mounted on, transported by, and fired from a specially designed railway wagon. Many countries have built railway guns, but the best known are the large Krupp-built pieces used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Smaller guns were often part of an armoured train. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The 38 cm Siegfried K ( E ) ( K - Kanone ( cannon ) , E - in Eisenbahnlafette ( on railroad mounting ) ) was a German World War II railway gun based on the 38 cm SK C / 34 naval gun that served as the main armament of the Bismarck - class battleships . Only four were produced . - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: His career spanned six decades; in that time he produced more than 700 records, wrote film scores and worked with music's greatest talents. His technical knowledge and love of experimentation saw him produce incredible sounds from equipment that modern musicians would consider primitive. His greatest success came with the Beatles; from the loveable mop-top recordings of the early 1960s to the acid-drenched psychedelia of Sergeant Pepper. George Henry Martin was born on 3 January 1926 into a working-class family in north London. His parents, a carpenter and a cleaner, wanted \\"a safe civil servant's job\\" for their son. He won a scholarship to St Ignatius' College in Stamford Hill, but when war broke out his parents moved out of London and he went to Bromley Grammar School. His passion for music really began when The London Symphony Orchestra, under Sir Adrian Boult, arrived to play a concert in the school hall. \\"It was absolutely magical. Hearing such glorious sounds, I found it difficult to connect them with 90 men and women blowing into brass and wooden instruments or scraping away at strings with horsehair bows. I could not believe my ears.\\" He harboured secret ambitions to be a composer but, in the event, took a job as a quantity surveyor before joining the Fleet Air Arm in 1943 where he qualified as a pilot. By 1947 Martin was playing the oboe professionally and had been accepted to study at the Guildhall School of Music, despite being unable to read or write a note. After graduation he spent a brief spell at the BBC's classical music department before walking through the doors of EMI in Abbey Road as a record producer. He took to the mixing desk like \\"a duck to water\\". Five years later, at the age of 29, as head of the Parlophone label, he worked with artists such as Shirley Bassey, Matt Monro and the jazz bands of Johnny Dankworth and Humphrey Lyttelton. Martin also produced catchy, comic numbers, and enjoyed such successes as Right Said Fred with Bernard Cribbins and Goodness Gracious Me with Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren. In 1962, Brian Epstein introduced him to four Liverpudlians. They had been rejected by every major record label in the country and Martin himself was more impressed by their strong personalities and natural wit than by their music. \\"They were raucous,\\" he later remembered. \\"Not very in tune. They weren't very good.\\" Nevertheless, he signed the Beatles and Love Me Do became their first hit later in 1962. Thus began the most successful recording studio partnership of all time. For the next eight years, Martin guided the Fab Four from the frothy pop sound of I Want To Hold Your Hand to the ambitious experimentation of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road. It was a steep learning curve for both producer and musicians. Martin had very little experience of pop music and the band had no idea how a recording studio worked. Martin's main talent lay in his ability to translate the adventurous ideas of Lennon and McCartney into practical recording terms. While McCartney could express his requirements, Lennon was often more vague. If he was searching for what he called \\"an orange sound\\", it became Martin's task to find it. But it all worked. In a 1975 interview with the BBC's Old Grey Whistle Test, John Lennon said that it was a true partnership. \\"Some people say George Martin did all of it, some say The Beatles did everything. It was neither one. We did a lot of learning together.\\" Martin's classical training became ever more valuable as the Beatles continued to push the boundaries of their music. He wrote and conducted the strings on Eleanor Rigby and the eclectic backing to I Am The Walrus. All this was being achieved on what would now be considered basic recording equipment, which would be pushed to the limit for the recording of the Sgt Pepper album. At the time, EMI had only four-track tape machines so Martin, and his engineers, devised a technique whereby a number of tracks were recorded and then mixed down on to one single track, giving the flexibility of a modern multi-tracked studio. He also made much use of recording different tracks at various tape speeds to change the texture of the final sound, a technique used to good effect on Lucy in the Sky. The harmony between band and producer suffered one of its rare hiccups when George Martin was temporarily unavailable and McCartney brought in another producer to arrange the strings on She's Leaving Home. By the time The White Album came to be recorded, Martin was working with a number of different artists and The Beatles produced many of the tracks themselves. Following the 1970 break-up of The Beatles, Martin worked with artists such as Sting, Jose Carreras, Celine Dion and Stan Getz, as well as Lennon and McCartney on their solo projects. By then he had set up his own company, AIR studios, which enabled him, for the very first time, to be able to receive royalties for his work. In the late 1970s, Martin built a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, and artists including Dire Straits and The Rolling Stones travelled there to record albums under Martin's respected guidance. When Hurricane Hugo devastated both island and studio in 1989, Martin produced a benefit album to help raise funds for the victims. Martin received a knighthood in 1996, and a year later, Elton John asked him to produce the reworking of his song Candle in the Wind for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. He persuaded the singer just to sit down in the studio and record it exactly as he had played it in Westminster Abbey. The resulting single was Martin's 30th number one record, the highest of any musical producer. He retired two years later after producing what he decreed would be his final album, In My Life, a collection of Beatles songs, rearranged and recorded by a collection of singers, film actors and musicians. However, he was not able to completely relax. In 2002 he was part of the team which put together the Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace and in 2006 he supervised the remixing of 80 Beatles tracks for use by Cirque de Soleil in a Las Vegas stage show called Love. In his career, George Martin worked with some of the best-known names in popular music - ranging from Jeff Beck, through Ultravox to the Mahavishnu Orchestra. But his enduring legacy will be his work with The Beatles whose timeless sounds, as acknowledged by the band members themselves, owe much to his input as a musician, arranger and producer.","completion":"George Martin was a very talented man who worked with music for a long time - 60 years!

When Karabakhis got hold of small arms to replace hunting rifles and crossbows, casualties began to mount; bridges were blown up, roads were blockaded, and hostages were taken.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"An arbalist is a type of soldier who specializes in using a crossbow as their primary weapon. The crossbow is a historical ranged weapon that utilizes an elastic launching device, consisting of a bow-like assembly mounted horizontally on a stock. It operates by pulling back the string of the bow, placing a projectile called a bolt or quarrel in the groove, and releasing the string to launch the projectile. The mention of arbalists in the context provided is significant, as it highlights the progression of the weaponry employed during the conflict surrounding the Nagorno-Karabakh region involving Azerbaijan and Armenia. In the late 1980s, tension between the two countries escalated, and the Popular Front of Azerbaijan was a political movement that sought for greater autonomy and independence from the Soviet Union. During that time, weapons were distributed among the local population in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Initially, the Karabakhis were only equipped with rudimentary weapons like hunting rifles and crossbows. However, as the conflict intensified, they began to obtain and utilize more advanced small arms. As a result, the levels of violence and casualties increased, leading to the destruction of infrastructure and hostage-taking incidents. The arbalist's valuable role in warfare predates this conflict by several centuries, with the crossbow playing a crucial role throughout the Middle Ages all the way up to the Early Modern period. The effectiveness of this weapon derives from its ability to launch projectiles with significant force and accuracy over long distances, which made it a fearsome and sought-after weapon during battles and sieges. In the Nagorno-Karabakh context, the arbalists and crossbowmen would have offered an effective method of engaging enemies from a distance before the introduction of more sophisticated firearms. Although crossbows eventually became outdated due to advancements in gunpowder technology, their early use in the conflict demonstrated the diverse range of arms employed to defend territories and uphold the interests of the local populace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While both actions involve planting something in the past, the items being planted are different. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is a necessary consequence of the first sentence. The first sentence states that a rosebed was planted last year, but it does not mention anything about planting pumpkin seeds. The second sentence states the planting of pumpkin seeds, which is an independent action that doesn't rely on the information provided in the first sentence. Step 4: Draw a conclusion. Based on the analysis, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence because the information in the second sentence is not a necessary consequence of the first sentence.

To come up with the answer, I used the definition of the given English terms and translated them into their Hebrew equivalents. Here's how I translated each part of the sentence into Hebrew: 1. We use: אנו משתמשים - The subject \\"we\\" was translated to אנו and the verb \\"use\\" was translated as משתמשים. 2. Over five billion tons: בלמעלה מחמישה ביליון טון - The phrase \\"over\\" was translated as בלמעלה מ, \\"five\\" as חמישה, \\"billion\\" as ביליון and \\"tons\\" as טון. 3. Of coal: פחם - The noun \\"coal\\" was directly translated as פחם. 4. 30 billion-plus barrels of oil: 30 ביליון ויותר חביות שמן - \\"30 billion\\" was translated as 30 ביליון, \\"plus\\" as ויותר, \\"barrels\\" as חביות, and \\"oil\\" as שמן. 5.

Article:Dale Bolinger, 58, bought an axe the day before he was due to meet a girl he chatted with online. He was found guilty in July of attempting to meet a girl under the age of 16 following sexual grooming. During online conversations, Bolinger described sex acts he wanted to perform on her and how he would kill her. Canterbury Crown Court heard he had online chats with someone he believed to be a 14-year-old Mexican girl called \\"Eva\\", who at other times claimed to be 16, with the name Nada. He arranged to meet her at Ashford International railway station on 18 September 2012 but she did not turn up.

Bolinger, formerly of Davidson Road, Canterbury, confessed to having cannibalistic thoughts from the age of six but claimed his interest was all \\"in fantasy\\". At his trial, Judge Adele Williams described his behaviour as \\"abhorrent, shocking and dangerous\\".

And do they masturbate? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from: - no; - yes;","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question is asking whether an underage teenager watching porn involving underage teenagers would be considered a pedophile. Legally, production, distribution, and possession of underage pornography is illegal regardless of the viewer's age. The term \\"pedophile\\" is often used to describe an adult who is sexually attracted to children. In this specific context, if the underage teen is attracted to individuals around their age range, it may not be accurate to label them as a pedophile. However, it is crucial to understand that underage pornography is illegal and should not be watched or shared by anyone. The second part of the first question concerns the sexual behaviors of teen girls. It's important to remember that people's experiences and behaviors are diverse, and making generalized statements about a whole cross-section of the population can be misleading. That being said, some teen girls do watch pornographic material and may masturbate. It's essential to recognize that sexuality is a natural part of human development, and teenagers need age-appropriate resources and education to help them navigate their burgeoning sexual identities in a healthy way. The second question is essentially asking if the behaviors mentioned in the first question are standard or typical for teenage girls. While it acknowledges that some teenagers watch pornographic material, it does not focus solely on underage porn as the first question does. It also mentions masturbation, which is a separate aspect of sexual exploration not explicitly discussed in the first question. The two questions address different specific aspects of teenage sexuality and are not paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Stephen Gregory Yzerman (; born May 9, 1965) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey player who spent his entire NHL playing career with the Detroit Red Wings and is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is currently the general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning. In 2017, Yzerman was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. Following the departure of Red Wings captain Danny Gare after the 1985-86 season, then-Head Coach Jacques Demers named Yzerman captain of the team on October 7, 1986, making him the youngest captain in the team's history. Demers said he \\"wanted a guy with the Red Wings crest tattooed on his chest.\\" The next season, Yzerman led the Wings to their first division title in 23 years. During the 1988-89 season, Yzerman recorded 155 points (65 goals and 90 assists), finishing third in regular season scoring behind Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky and also winning the Lester B. Pearson Award (MVP as voted by the National Hockey League Players' Association), and was a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP as voted by the NHL writers). When Scotty Bowman took over as coach in 1993, Yzerman initially chafed under Bowman's stern coaching style. Bowman, for his part, felt that Yzerman was not concentrating enough on defence; Bowman had long expected his forwards to be good back-checkers as well. Relations between the two became so strained that at one point, the Red Wings seriously considered trading him to the then-moribund Ottawa Senators. Yzerman, however, gradually became a better defender and is now considered one of the best two-way forwards in the history of the game. In 1995, Yzerman led Detroit to its first Stanley Cup finals series since 1966, but the Red Wings were swept by the New Jersey Devils. Before the start of the 1995-96 NHL season, Yzerman's leadership was called into question and soon he had to deal with rumours that he was to be traded to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Mathieu Schneider and a first-round draft pick, a deal that was publicized in Le Journal de Montreal as being pushed for hard by Yzerman's former coach Jacques Demers. Detroit finished the season with an NHL-record 62 regular season wins and were heavily favoured to win the Stanley Cup. Yzerman scored perhaps the most memorable goal of his career in the 1996 playoffs, stealing the puck from Wayne Gretzky and beating St. Louis Blues goaltender Jon Casey with a slap shot from the blue line to win the Western Conference Semifinals in double overtime of Game 7. The Red Wings, however, fell short of their ultimate goal, losing in six games to the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals. Was he a Hockey captian?","completion":"Yes, Stephen Gregory Yzerman was a hockey captain. Following the departure of Red Wings captain Danny Gare after the 1985-86 season, then-Head Coach Jacques Demers named Yzerman as the captain of the team on October 7, 1986. This appointment made him the youngest captain in the team's history.

Question: A beaver builds structures to block what sort of feature? Options: A. books B. zoo C. body of water D. wooded area E. animals","completion":"The answer to the question is C. body of water. A beaver is an industrious, primarily nocturnal, and semi-aquatic rodent known for its remarkable ability to modify its environment by building structures like dams, lodges, and canals. The primary reason behind the beaver's construction of dams is to create a stable environment to allow for the creation of a pond or water body that the beaver will use for both its shelter and as a means of food procurement. Beavers build dams using materials like sticks, stones, mud, and other available natural resources. The purpose of building these structures is to control and manipulate the flow of water, enabling them to create a safe and comfortable habitat that is less likely to be penetrated by predators. These dam structures also serve various essential purposes for the ecosystem. First, they trap sediment and impurities, leading to improved water quality downstream. Second, beaver ponds provide habitats for a wide variety of plants and animals, promoting biodiversity and the overall health of the ecosystem. Third, the built ecosystems help to slow down the rate of water flow, playing a crucial role in flood control and maintaining the water table at a more stable level. In summary, beavers build structures like dams to block and control the flow of a body of water, ultimately utilizing the created pond to establish a safe and sustainable habitat that benefits both themselves and the surrounding ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He left advanced base camp, on the northern, Chinese side of the mountain, at 2 a.m. and reached the peak at 9 p.m. This was just five days after he set a fastest known time up the mountain from base camp, completing the journey in 26 hours. Let’s start with this: Kilian Jornet is a freak of nature. Compare his ascent, which was made without the use of fixed ropes or supplemental oxygen, to that of climber Adrian Ballinger, who summited on the same day, also without oxygen. Ballinger is a talented mountaineer. This is his seventh summit of Everest and he has six other summits on 8,000-meter peaks. Ballinger left advanced base camp on May 24th and it took him three days to reach the summit. That’s not because he’s weak—he’s an extraordinarily strong climber. (It takes many climbers four days to make it to the summit.) That’s just to say that Jornet is absurdly gifted. Jornet’s most recent attempt isn’t exactly an apples-to-apples comparison of his initial climb, which left from base camp rather than advanced base camp, a difference of 4,265 vertical feet. Even still, he just barely missed setting the fastest known time from advanced base camp to the summit, a record held by Hans Kammerlander, who did the route in 16 hours and 45 minutes in 1996. But that shouldn’t take away from the fact that Jornet just ran 8,000 vertical feet up the world’s highest mountain—a mountain on which it’s hard to breathe, period, for the last third of it—in less than a day. ||||| Trail running Refused supplemental oxygen For the second time in a week, Kilian Jornet reached Mount Everest's summit, climbing all the way up from the advanced base camp, located at 6,500 metres of altitude in Tibet. It took the Catalan climber only 17 hours to cover the distance after departing the camp on May 27. Jornet, who refused to use supplemental oxygen and fixed ropes, overcame the strong winds and returned to the advanced base camp upon completion of the ascension, as announced by his 'Summits of my Life' team. This second attempt had been put in doubt because Jornet had to deal with an untimely stomach ache, but the star climber still managed to conquer the challenge. Austria's Christian Stangl holds the record for the fastest climb; 16 hours and 42 minutes to make it to the peak in 2016. Italian mountaineer Hans Kammerlander needed three more minutes in 2006 using the North Face route. ||||| Kilian Jornet claims to have raced up the world’s highest mountain in 17 hours just five days after summiting in 26 hours A Spanish climber and long-distance runner claims to have raced up Mount Everest twice in one week without using supplemental oxygen or fixed ropes, opening up what he calls “a new realm of possibilities in alpinism”. Kilian Jornet, a 29-year-old mountaineer from Catalonia, says he reached the 8,848-metre (29,029ft) summit of the world’s highest mountain at 9pm local time on Saturday after a 17-hour ascent. The time, which has yet to be officially confirmed, is just 15 minutes off the record set by the Italian climber Hans Kammerlander, who climbed Everest in 16 hours and 45 minutes in 1996. Five days earlier, Jornet claimed to have scaled Everest in 26 hours. He had been planning to set a round-trip record but was forced to slow his pace after coming down with stomach cramps and vomiting. In tweets and a blogpost on Sunday, Jornet said it was “cool to summit Everest twice in one season” without using oxygen. “Today I felt good, although it was really windy so it was hard to move fast,” he said. “I think summiting Everest twice in one week without oxygen opens up a new realm of possibilities in alpinism and I’m really happy to have done it.” According to his blog, Jornet left advanced based camp at 6,500 metres and ascended using the normal route, passing the three high-altitude camps used by climbers attempting to scale Everest. “The climb to the summit was slow but continuous,” read a statement. “The wind was the main obstacle Jornet had to overcome, on an extremely windy Himalayan day. Weather conditions improved throughout the night in the latter part of the route and he returned to advanced base camp 29 hours 30 minutes after leaving.” Agence France-Presse reported that the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, which validates all Everest summits on the north side of the mountain, had yet to confirm Jornet’s feat. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The China Tibet Mountaineering Association, which validates all summits on Everest’s north side, has yet to confirm Jornet’s feat. Photograph: Alamy Ten people have died attempting to climb Everest this season. A record 509 permits have been issued to foreign climbers. Jornet, who was accompanied on his Everest expedition by Sébastien Montaz-Rosset, a mountain guide and cameraman, is on a quest to set new records for the fastest ascents of some of the world’s best-known mountains. His Summits of My Life project has already seen him scale Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn in Europe, Denali in North America and Aconcagua in South America. Jornet, who describes himself as a “semi-nomadic” mountain lover, said he saw competing as a way to meet friends and better himself. “But, above all, I conceive sport as a way to discover landscapes both inside and outside you,” he said on his website. “I love silence and solitude, but communication, listening, reading, writing and travelling also appeal to me … My life is spent pursuing and fighting for my dreams.” In 1986 two Swiss climbers, Jean Troillet and Erhard Loretan, ascended and descended Everest in less than two days without oxygen and ropes. ||||| Kilian Jornet climbed in a single push the north face of Mount Everest (8.848m) for the second time in a week. For this he did not use oxygen nor fixed ropes. Jornet had already reached the summit on 22nd May but stomach cramps had prevented him from completing the route as planned. He said: “I’m so happy to have made the summit again! Today I felt good although it was really windy so it was hard to move fast. I think summiting Everest twice in one week without oxygen opens up a new realm of possibilities in alpinism and I’m really happy to have done it” One week, two summits Jornet reached the summit via the North Face of Everest on 27th May at 9pm (+5.45GMT). He left Advanced Base Camp at 6500m. He climbed to the summit on the ‘normal’ route passing the three high altitude camps used by climbers attempting the world’s highest mountain, a climb which takes on average four days. The climb to the summit was slow but continuous. The wind was the main obstacle Jornet had to overcome, on an extremely windy Himalayan day. Weather conditions improved throughout the night in the latter part of the route and he returned to Advanced Base Camp 29 hours 30 minutes after leaving. With this ascent Jornet repeats the feat of reaching the world’s highest point after having climbed to the summit six days previously. On the previous climb he reached the summit in 26 hours, leaving from Base Camp at Rongbuk monastery at 5100m. The climb had begun well but he was hampered by stomach problems from 7500m, which slowed him down considerably and forced him to make repeated stops. Returning to Base Camp Jornet explained that: I didn’t feel great and was moving very slowly. I had to stop every few metres with cramps and vomiting. But I felt ok with the altitude and decided to continue. When I got back down I thought I would like to try another attempt if I felt well enough. The two ascents are part of the Summits of My Life project, in which Jornet has travelled to some of the most emblematic mountains across the globe setting records for fastest known ascents. He began in the Mont Blanc range in 2012 and has since climbed in Europe (Mont Blanc & Matterhorn), in North America (Denali) and in South America (Aconcagua). Jornet has been accompanied on this Everest expedition by Sébastien Montaz-Rosset, mountain guide and cameraman. Jornet is currently resting in Everest Base Camp before returning to Europe.

Several years later, a much older Meggie (Eliza Bennett) travels with her father Mo to visit an old book shop in Italy, unaware that he is secretly looking for a copy of the book, Inkheart. Shortly after finding one, Meggie comes across a marten with horns outside the shop, who tries to bite her fingers. Suddenly, a man (Paul Bettany) appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend while revealing the marten's name as Gwin. When Mo comes out of the book shop, he quickly recognizes the man as a person called Dustfinger, whom quickly asks to be read back into the book, only for Mo to flee with Meggie from him. Travelling across Italy, Mo takes Meggie on a visit to Meggie's great aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren), whereupon he reveals to Meggie why he fled from Dustfinger. While she was young, Mo read to her from Inkheart, inadvertently freeing Dustfinger as a result, due to a gift he possessed from birth, that marks him as a \\"Silver Tongue\\". Unfortunately, his gift also freed the book's villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis) and several of his henchman, but at the same time, losing Resa after being forced to flee with his infant daughter. Soon, Dustfinger reappears seeking Mo, accompanied by Capricorn's minion, Basta (Jamie Foreman), who quickly captures Mo and his family and takes back Inkheart, destroying Elinor's valuable library in the process.

After the ants were in the glass farm, they started to make tunnels . I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. Each had its own job. On the fifth day a tragedy happened. I put my face so close to the glass farm that I knocked it over. All the tunnels fell down. Although the ants remained alive after their earthquake, one by one began to die. I was scared as I watched them give up building their tunnels to carry the bodies to a corner the farm. My mother said that the ants were dying of sadness. They simply could not stand that their tunnels were gone. Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Mom had hoped it would teach me about the natural world, but it taught me much more. Over the years, I came to realize the importance of teamwork. Working together, the ants were able to make an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently: Adversity is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, we cannot give up when we are sad. We have to realize that if a tunnel is gone, we must build another. Giving up, I say, is not a good choice. Question: What did the writer learn from the ant tragedy a few years later?

How to take care of a german shepherd Make sure your german shepherd is getting proper nutrition. Since german shepherds large, active dogs and are known to have hips that give out, it's important to make sure they have good nutrition throughout their lives. Make sure to buy healthy food that is not full of filler ingredients. Select from the following. (I). You can buy fresh vegetables, dairy products, and leafy greens at your local pet store, farm-supply store, or online. As humans, they require an occasional meal consisting of processed grains, cakes, rice, and beans. (II). Make sure your dog's fur is not wet and he has plenty of room for movement and play. German shepherds have two basic body functions: eating and walking. (III). For example, make sure you are feeding a quality food that contains animal protein and doesn't use corn for protein. You can feed your german shepherd dry or wet food, or a combination of both. (IV). Ensure your dog is drinking at least 6 ounces of water a day and is with its mother regularly. German shepherds need between 7.5-9 hours of sleep every night.","completion":"Step 1: Choose high-quality dog food Go with option III: Select a high-quality dog food with animal protein as the primary ingredient, as it is vital for your German shepherd's overall health. Avoid foods that use corn for protein, as they may not provide adequate nourishment. You can feed your German shepherd a mix of dry and wet food to satisfy their dietary needs. Step 2: Ensure your dog gets proper exercise and playtime Choose option II: Since German shepherds are active dogs, it's essential to give them plenty of room for movement and play. Ensure their fur is dry to avoid any hygiene-related issues. Regular exercise is vital for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing potential problems, such as hip dysplasia. Step 3: Provide fresh water and an adequate sleeping schedule Incorporate aspects of option IV: Ensure your German shepherd has access to at least 6 ounces of fresh water daily to stay hydrated. While the requirement to be with its mother applies only to puppies, it's essential to provide a comfortable and safe environment for your dog. Make sure your German shepherd gets between 7.5-9 hours of sleep every night for proper rest and recovery. Step 4: Monitor health and provide occasional treats While option I suggests providing your German Shepherd with vegetables, dairy products, leafy greens, processed grains, cakes, rice, and beans, it is more suitable for humans. However, you may offer your German shepherd occasional healthy treats and vegetables like carrots or green beans, which can serve as low-calorie snacks. Always consult with your veterinarian before introducing new food items to ensure they are safe for your dog."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You are presented with the question \\"what is plasma created with?\\" and the following answer choices: - heat - Urea - Gases - oxygen - energy - a star - immune - cells Now knowing that heat can change the state of matter and plasma, the fourth state of matter, can be created on earth by supplying sufficient heat, choose the best answer.","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"what is plasma created with?\\" is heat. Plasma, often referred to as the fourth state of matter, can be created with the application of sufficient heat to substances, particularly gases. This process involves providing enough thermal energy to a gas, which causes its atoms and molecules to become highly ionized, resulting in the formation of plasma. Plasma can be found in many places, both on Earth and in the universe. For instance, stars, including our Sun, are composed mostly of plasma, as the extreme temperatures and pressures within their cores cause the gases they are made up of to ionize and exhibit plasma-like properties. On Earth, plasma can be observed in phenomena such as lightning, neon signs, and fluorescent lights. Let's examine the other answer choices: 1. Urea: Urea is an organic compound and is the primary nitrogenous waste product excreted in the urine of mammals. Urea is not involved in the creation of plasma. 2. Gases: While gases can be transformed into plasma with sufficient heat, the term 'gases' itself does not encompass the process of creating plasma. Therefore, this answer is not the best choice. 3. Oxygen: Oxygen is a naturally occurring element and a necessary component for the process of cellular respiration. It is not directly involved in the creation of plasma, although, as a gas, it can transform into plasma under certain conditions such as extreme heat. 4. Energy: Though energy is a key requirement for transforming matter into plasma, the term 'energy' is quite broad and may not specifically represent the process of creating plasma. Therefore, this answer is not the best choice. 5. A star: Stars, as mentioned earlier, mainly consist of plasma; however, they are the result of plasma, not the actual cause or process behind creating plasma. 6. Immune: This term typically refers to the immune system, a bodily defense mechanism that protects organisms from harmful pathogens and diseases. It is not related to the creation of plasma. 7. Cells: Cells are the basic unit of life for living organisms and are not directly related to the creation of plasma. In conclusion, the best answer to the question \\"what is plasma created with?\\" is heat, as the application of substantial heat to substances, particularly gases, can ionize their atoms and molecules, resulting in plasma formation. This process demonstrates the powerful effect of heat on changing the state of matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Education is the foundation upon which individuals build their futures, opening doors to numerous opportunities and paving the way for success. It enables people to develop their potential, leading ultimately to greater social and economic prosperity. This article delves into the importance of education for children and how it shapes their futures in profound ways. The Role of Education in a Child's Life Education is crucial for instilling a sense of curiosity and enthusiasm for learning in children. Starting from an early age, a good education introduces a child to the world, allowing them to explore their interests, talents, and passions. By acquiring necessary skills such as reading, writing, and critical thinking, a child's ability to navigate through life is significantly improved. Education also plays a vital role in teaching children about cultural, social, and moral values, which help them interact with others and contribute positively to society. The Connection Between Education and Opportunity Quality education is synonymous with opportunity. With the right foundation, children can make informed decisions about their lives, enabling them to pursue their aspirations and goals. Furthermore, by ensuring access to a plethora of opportunities, education reduces the likelihood of life-altering obstacles that might otherwise limit a child's potential. For instance, educated individuals are more likely to secure higher-paying jobs and enjoy overall financial stability. This financial stability not only guarantees a better quality of life but also allows them to invest in their children's education, creating a positive cycle of success. Additionally, education plays a unique role in bolstering social mobility, giving children from disadvantaged backgrounds a chance to break free from the cycle of poverty. The Long-Term Effects on Society The benefits of a good education also extend to society at large. As children grow up to become skilled and knowledgeable adults, they contribute substantially to the development of their communities. An educated populace is more likely to engage in civic duties, fostering a healthy democracy and leading to greater social cohesion. Moreover, education is key to addressing various global challenges, including poverty, inequality, and climate change. By producing leaders who are well-equipped to find innovative solutions to these issues, education directly influences the course of our future. Ensuring Equal Access to Education Considering the profound impact education has on a child's life, it is crucial that all children, regardless of their background, have equal access to quality education. Unfortunately, disparities still exist, particularly in developing nations where poverty poses significant barriers to education. Investing in robust policies to protect and empower vulnerable and marginalized children, and promoting inclusivity in education, is of paramount importance. Furthermore, educational reforms are necessary to ensure the system meets the diverse needs of all children. Emphasizing skills-based learning, character development, and creativity can help nurture well-rounded individuals, enhancing the overall impact of education. Conclusion In conclusion, the transformative power of education is undeniable. By providing children with the necessary tools and opportunities to succeed in life, education ultimately shapes the course of their futures and the society they live in. As we strive to create a more equitable and sustainable world, ensuring that every child has access to quality education must remain a top priority. By doing so, we can create a bright future for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it.

Article: The big four gluten culprits are wheat, rye, barley, and triticale. Avoid these in all cases, whether you are only gluten-intolerant or have celiac. Wheat to avoid includes kamut and spelt. Because wheat often goes by another name, here are varieties of wheat to also definitely avoid: Bulgur Durum flour Farina Graham flour Kamut Semolina Rye contains a protein called secalin, which is a form of gluten. Triticale, a cross between rye and wheat, is actually a hybrid designed in laboratories in the late 19th century. Barley is the last big gluten cereal to avoid. It is commonly made into meals and used in alcohol production, among others. White oats themselves do not contain gluten, they are often cross-contaminated with wheat because both are commonly processed in the same facilities. Avoid eating oats and oatmeal unless the packaging specifically designates the product as gluten-free. In theory, the distillation process removes all gluten proteins if done properly, even if the alcohol was manufactured using a glutinous grain (such as wheat, barley, or rye). You can safely drink alcohols such as vodka manufactured from wheat, but be wary of beer. Look for beer that is specifically designated gluten-free. In theory, the distillation process removes all glutinous proteins. But in reality, cross-contamination may occur. Not only this, but some distillers may add mash to alcohols after distillation as a filler. This may cast doubt on alcohol's ability to deliver truly safe results. If you really want to be careful, stick with potato-based vodkas, tequilas and mescals, or rums. These all contain non-gluten grain sources, so they should be fine to drink. Checking labels is important. While many of the following kinds of foods have been and are being made gluten-free, many of them aren't. It's better to be safe than sorry. Avoid: Breads, croutons, cereals, and crackers Cookies, cakes, and candies Imitation meat, imitation seafood, processed lunch meats, and \\"self-basting\\" poultry Salad dressings, gravies, sauces (such as soy sauce), and vegetables in sauces Pastas and \\"seasoned\\" rice mixes Soups, matzo, and processed snacks like chips (potato chips and tortilla chips) What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: The big four gluten culprits to avoid are wheat, rye, barley, and triticale.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who returned to Australia in 1917? ? Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

Praxis Answer:","completion":"Title: Praxis: The Final Strike Genre: Sci-Fi/Action Plot: In the year 2293, deep within Klingon territories, tension brews as the valuable energy-producing moon Praxis falls into a critical state. As tales of natural disasters on the moon increase, the Klingon High Council desperately seeks a way to stabilize Praxis and preserve their most significant source of dilithium, a mineral crucial to all spacefaring civilizations. Dr. Toral, a renowned Klingon scientist, who believes that drilling into the moon's core will save it, receives constant pushback. His daughter, K'Lara, desperate to save her people, decides to gather a team of specialists from both the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets, led by Captain James T. Kirk. The powerful alliance between Klingon and human characters marks a unique break in age-old hostilities, in the name of survival. In their dangerous journey to the unstable moon, the team faces multiple challenges, including hostile Klingon factions who see this collaboration as defiance: a challenge to their way of life. The crew must fend off these threats while racing against the clock to save Praxis from collapsing. As they drill into the core, they make an unexpected discovery: the energy fluctuations in Praxis's core aren't natural. Instead, they are man-made, orchestrated by a rogue faction of Romulans seeking to destabilize the balance of power in the galaxy. As the energy fluctuations continue, the moon's inevitable explosion draws near with little time to spare. In a climactic battle, Kirk and K'Lara's team face off against the cunning Romulan threat, who were using the moon as a weapon to trigger a war between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets. The team defeats the Romulans and uses the knowledge and technology of both the Klingons and the Federation to devise a desperate plan to stabilize Praxis's core. Their efforts succeed, albeit at great personal cost, as several crew members heroically sacrifice themselves to save millions. In the aftermath, the universe slowly begins to heal from the brink of annihilation. K'Lara earns distinction in the Klingon Empire, and her father's reputation is vindicated. With Praxis saved, dedicated to those who died in the struggle for peace, the Federation and the Klingon Empire forge a new, tentative alliance, honoring the brave individuals that laid the foundation for a potential future of unity and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rob Smith (@robsmithonline) has all the details. Buzz60 Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Twitter attends the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 6, 2016 in Sun Valley, Idaho. (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey started a social media firestorm and then apologized after he tweeted that he ordered food from Chick-fil-A. Critics jumped on Dorsey for supporting Chick-fil-A during the month of June, which is Pride Month for the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning) community. Chick-fil-A came under fire from gay rights supporters in 2012 because of comments made by the fast food chicken chain’s CEO, Dan Cathay, expressing opposition to same-sex marriage. The company had also donated millions to anti-gay groups. The controversy spurred angry protests at stores by activists as well as supporters who came to rally behind the the company. Dorsey's tweet reignited the debate. The backlash included comments like: “Why is Twitter boosting a notoriously anti-gay company during #PrideMonth” “Wow, I thought better of you @jack Way to support a homophobic company during Pride month.” “Did your meal come with a side-order of homophonic bigotry or did you pay extra for it?” FACES OF PRIDE: Memebers of the LGBTQ community and their allies sound off from all 50 states Dorsey acknowledged the situation after former CNN host Soledad O’Brien tweeted :\\"This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack.\\" Dorsey responded in a tweet: “You’re right. Completley forgot about their background.” You’re right. Completely forgot about their background — jack (@jack) June 10, 2018 Not all the responses were negative as some on social media rushed to support Dorsey and Chick-fil-A. \\"Don't give in to these people and their complaints. I'm gay and I LOVE ChickfilA. Ridiculous. Go on and eat that ChickfilA and post as much as you want about it!\\" “I don’t let politics dictate my food choices. The LGBTQ community is free to make equally tasty and “hate-free” chicken. Until it happens, there’s Chick-fil-a.” “This just shows what a sad world we live in...when a guy feels he has to apologize for eating a chicken sandwich?!” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2JAtfoB ||||| Twitter's Jack Dorsey Isn't the Only One Who Forgot Chick-fil-A Is Anti-LGBT The CEO of Twitter got a public shaming for promoting Chick-fil-A during Pride Month. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is getting a very public reminding that Chick-fil-A is not an LGBT-supportive company — though he’s far from the only one who has forgotten. If the crowds at your local Chick-fil-A are any indication, much of the United States, even in progressive cities and on college campuses, has forgotten that management of the restaurant chain is opposed to marriage equality and has kept right on giving money to anti-LGBT causes. Dorsey forgot that when he posted this tweet: The reaction was quick: This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack https://t.co/Wmhq6Obrp1 — Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) June 10, 2018 Dorsey issued his regrets: You’re right. Completely forgot about their background — jack (@jack) June 10, 2018 Dorsey is far from the first to forget about that background. None other than BuzzFeed posted a fawning story in October headlined \\"15 Facts About Chick-fil-A That'll Make You Say, 'Woah, That's Crazy,” and it never mentioned its anti-LGBT history. The piece just talked about how delicious everything tastes. Even Democrats have sometimes forgotten, as evidenced during a sit-in for gun control in 2016, when they ordered out for Chick-fil-A. Aside from its record of questionable donations via its foundation, Chick-fil-A also scores a zero on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Although it has some vocal queer defenders, the company has taken no action that would show it welcomes LGBT customers — not a commercial, not a Pride proclamation, nothing. Last year, ThinkProgress reported on Chick-fil-A’s most recent financial disclosures that showed it was still giving in 2015 to anti-LGBT causes. That’s two years after CEO Dan Cathy swore he would stop. The mix of donations changed, with money going to less overtly anti-LGBT groups. But the theme remains. ThinkProgress noted 1 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which has a “sexual purity” policy that bans “homosexual acts.” Another 200,000 went to the Paul Anderson Youth Home, which teaches boys that abuse they faced as children “has produced all kinds of evil throughout the culture to include the explosion of homosexuality in the last century.” The Salvation Army got 130,000 — and yes, it’s still openly opposed to marriage equality. The restaurant chain was recently in the news again because Scott Pruitt, the anti-LGBT head of the Environmental Protection Agency, tried (and failed) to win a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife. He praised the company as a “franchise of faith.” In other words, the right wing has not forgotten what Chick-fil-A stands for. Just the opposite. Mike Huckabee once hosted a national Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day in response to the backlash over its anti-LGBT donations. Now conservatives enjoy ordering Chick-fil-A just to show allegiance. They eat it so often that Sen. Lisa Murkowski once complained it was getting a little tedious to attend meetings. With this latest incident, the use of Chick-fil-A as symbology for social conservatism continues. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio jumped into the Twitter debate to claim the left has gone too far with its dislike for Chick-fil-A. This lunacy has gone too far. The CEO of @Twitter bullied into apology for patronizing @ChickfilA because owners support “biblical definition of marriage”. Holding a personal view taught by mainstream Christianity is now boycott worthy. https://t.co/EnChlPBStc via @cbsmoneywatch — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 11, 2018 At least one famous Twitter user gets the sense that Republicans use Chick-fil-A as a political football. ||||| Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey ignited a backlash after eating at Chick-fil-A. Getty Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey ignited a backlash online after revealing that he ate at Chick-fil-A this month. On Saturday, Dorsey posted a photo on Twitter with the caption \\"Boost @ChickfilA,\\" showing he had saved 10% on a 31.58 order at the fast-food chain. A \\"boost\\" is a cashback reward Square users can earn when using a Cash Card, which is a debit card from the payment platform. Critics immediately seized on Dorsey's support of Chick-fil-A — whose CEO has come under fire for his views on same-sex marriage in the past — during Pride Month. Twitter/@jack \\"You must love the taste of bigotry!\\" one person wrote in response. \\"Why is Twitter boosting a notoriously anti-gay company during #PrideMonth?\\" another person wrote. Among the critics was the former CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien, who said, \\"This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack.\\" Dorsey responded: \\"You're right. Completely forgot about their background.\\" Twitter/@jack Some people supported Dorsey's decision to eat at Chick-fil-A, saying that it's \\"great\\" and that he shouldn't have to apologize for eating a chicken sandwich. One person tweeted: \\"Don't give in to these people and their complaints. I'm gay and I LOVE ChickfilA. Ridiculous. Go on and eat that ChickfilA and post as much as you want about it!\\" The backlash shows Chick-fil-A still has lingering problems with its brand image following remarks six years ago by the company's CEO, Dan Cathy, regarding his views on same-sex marriage. Cathy set off a fury among gay-rights supporters in 2012 that led to nationwide protests after he told the Baptist Press that the company was \\"guilty as charged\\" for backing \\"the biblical definition of the family unit.\\" Reports soon emerged detailing Chick-fil-A's many charitable donations to anti-LGBTQ organizations. For months afterward, protesters rallied outside Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country and held \\"kiss-ins,\\" where same-sex couples kissed in front of onlookers and TV cameras covering the backlash. Since then, Chick-fil-A has worked to shed its controversial image, and over time, protests against the chain have largely dissipated. Given the backlash against Dorsey's Chick-fil-A meal, however, it seems the fast-food chain still has some work to do to move past Cathy's comments. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey faced a strong backlash and subsequent apology after tweeting about a meal he had purchased at fast-food chain Chick-fil-A during Pride Month, prompting critics to point out the restaurant's history of anti-LGBTQ actions.

He is about to be released but Clouseau (Peter Sellers), who is now Chief Inspector and has arrived to speak on Dreyfus's behalf, comes to visit and his clumsiness and proneness to accidents drive Dreyfus insane again.Soon thereafter, Dreyfus escapes from the asylum, intent on killing Clouseau, who apparently had become a deranged good-cop-gone-bad. His first attempt involves planting a bomb under Clouseau's apartment whilst Clouseau destructively duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk), who is under orders to keep Clouseau alert by randomly attacking him. The bomb merely destroys Clouseau's apartment whilst Clouseau himself is unharmed, largely because Clouseau has been distracted by an inflatable costume and a telephone call. Cato ends up in the hospital.Using his knowledge of the underworld, Dreyfus frees Anthony Tournier (John Sullivan), a bank robber Clouseau had recently arrested, from prison. Other criminals with a grudge against Clouseau flock under their banner.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Floyd Mayweather Will Earn More Than 80 Million For Record Breaking Fight Showtime Networks announced Thursday that Saturday’s fight between Floyd Mayweather and Saul “Canelo” Alvarez, billed as “The One,” generated a record 150 million in pay-per-view revenue on 2.2 million buys. It breaks the record of 136 million for Mayweather’s 2007 fight against Oscar De La Hoya, but falls short of the 2.5 buys for that bout. “It shows the health of boxing and that it can deliver at the highest level,” says Richard Schaefer, CEO of Golden Boy which promoted both Mayweather fights. Showtime, owned by CBS CBS, is still counting PPV receipts from distributors and says “The One” has a shot at catching the 2007 De La Hoya fight in terms of total buys. The initial report had the 2007 fight at 2.15 million buys, but the total has grown over the years as more distributors reported sales of the event. Schaefer says money was still coming in last year for the 2007 fight. “It is the gift that keeps on giving,” he says. Mayweather received a record guaranteed purse of 41.5 million purse for the fight, and as co-promoter with Golden Boy, he will also reap the spoils of the PPV haul. Mayweather is set to earn more than 80 million from the fight based on the current PPV estimates, and his final take could approach 100 million if the ultimate PPV tally exceeds 2.5 million buys. The one night payday tops the previous record in boxing of 52 million that De La Hoya received for the 2007 Mayweather fight. The Canelo fight pushes Mayweather’s career earnings over the 350 million mark. And despite his free-spending ways and penchant for gambling, Mayweather showed that he has built up a sizable nest egg in a recent ESPN The Magazine story when he displayed his 123 million balance on a bank receipt. “This is everything we expected when Floyd made the move to CBS and Showtime. The best working with the best and record-breaking results,” says Leonard Ellerbe, head of Mayweather Promotions. Whether “The One” ultimately breaks the PPV buy record or not, it is a huge win for Showtime, which signed Mayweather to a blockbuster six-fight deal in February that will net the boxer more than 250 million. Showtime signed Mayweather to raise the profile of the network and help close the subscription gap with HBO. Mayweather’s first bout under the contract against Roberto Guerrero in May drew a disappointing PPV audience that Showtime announced was one million buys. But the Canelo fight generated an unprecedented amount of coverage and was breaking records long before the pay-per-view total was counted. “The One” set a record for largest gate for a boxing match at 20 million with the MGM Grand Arena selling out in less than 24 hours. It was also the largest closed circuit viewing audience for a bout with more than 26,000 tickets sold in Las Veagas at 100 a pop and more than 500 movie theaters showing the fight. Merchandise and sponsorships also hit record levels. Schaefer says the fight will exceed 200 million in total revenue when all revenue streams are counted. Speculation is swirling on Mayweather’s next opponent with Danny Garcia, Amir Khan and Adrian Broner the popular names. And then there is the ever elusive possibility of Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao finally squaring off. Floyd is expected to be back in the ring in May for the third bout of his six-fight Showtime deal. Ellerbe says they don’t know what is going to happen next and adds, “Floyd is going to take some time off and take a much deserved vacation.” He can certainly afford it.

Summary:","completion":"Floyd Mayweather had a boxing match with Saul \\"Canelo\\" Alvarez that was watched by many people on TV. Because so many people watched, they made a lot of money - around 150 million! This was a new record, which means it hasn't happened before. Floyd was paid at least 80 million for this fight alone, which is a lot of money, even for a big-time boxer like him. This fight made more money than Floyd's fight in 2007 with Oscar De La Hoya. This shows that boxing is still very popular. Because of all the money he's earned, Floyd can relax and take a nice vacation if he wants to.

PUBLISHED:. 11:55 EST, 21 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 12:15 EST, 21 January 2014. Smog blowing across the Pacific towards the United States from China is often caused by the manufacture of goods for export to America, a new study has claimed. Researchers found pollution choking the American West Coast comes from China's production of mobile phones, televisions and other consumer goods for export. Dr Steve Davis, from the University of. California, Irvine said: ‘We've outsourced our manufacturing and much of. our pollution, but some of it is blowing back across the Pacific to. haunt us. Cities like Los Angeles (pictured) received at least an extra day of smog a year from nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide from China's export-dependent factories, a report said. ‘Given the complaints about how Chinese pollution is corrupting other countries' air, this paper shows that there may be plenty of blame to go around.’ The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to work out how much pollution reaching the West Coast originates from China. Los Angeles, for example, experiences at least one extra day of smog that exceeds legal limits because of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emitted by Chinese factories producing goods for export. Black carbon has been linked to numerous health problems including athsma, emphysema, heart and lung disease and even cancer. It can be problematic because rain doesn't easily wash it out of the atmosphere. The study also revealed that as much as a quarter of the sulphate pollution on the US West Coast is tied to Chinese exports. Chinese citizens wear masks on their faces on a hazy day while walking to their respective destinations in Beijing. However, China is not responsible for the lion's share of pollution in the U.S. - cars, trucks and refineries pump out far more. Japan and South Korea have regularly suffered noxious clouds from their neighbour in the last couple of decades as environmental regulations have been sacrificed for economic and industrial growth. But powerful global winds known as ‘westerlies’ can carry chemicals over the ocean to the U.S in days, particularly during spring, causing dangerous spikes in contaminants. And dust, ozone and carbon can accumulate in valleys and basins in California and other Western states. The authors believe the findings could play an important role in the future negotiation of clean air treaties. China's huge surge in industrial activity in recent years, as well as poor pollution controls, has led to often fierce international debates. The researchers wrote: ‘International cooperation to reduce transboundary transport of air pollution must confront the question of who is responsible for emissions in one country during production of goods to support consumption in another.’ Dr Davis said: ‘When you buy a product at Wal-Mart, it has to be manufactured somewhere. ‘The product doesn't contain the pollution, but creating it caused the pollution.’ Pollution has been so bad in China recently that flights have been diverted. This picture shows cars in a haze in Beijing. Air quality is of increasing concern to China's stability-obsessed leaders, anxious to douse potential unrest as a more affluent urban population turns against a growth-at-all-costs economic model that has poisoned much of the country's air, water and soil. Authorities have invested in various projects to fight pollution, but none has worked so far. In Shanghai the smog has been so severe recently that flights have been diverted, schools closed and authorities left mulling whether to distribute gas masks to the mega-city’s residents. The population stands at 23million and it’s not been made clear whether every person would receive a mask, but officials are becoming increasingly concerned at pollution levels and may at least give one to people who work outside. Last year authorities claimed that illegal barbecues were contributing to the air pollution in Beijing and seized and subsequently destroyed 500 of them, according to Shanghai Daily. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A study claims that smog from China, often caused by the manufacturing of goods for export to the U.S., is blowing across the Pacific towards the U.S. West Coast.

The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on the earth,but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in lifestyles and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization \\".Many cancers and diseases of the blood system,including heart attacks and strokes are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stoneage people used very little alcohol or tobacco ,probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise,but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stoneage people hunted wild animals for their meat ,which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products ,and they made very little use of grains . But today,we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stoneage people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C.

First, you say you want to do something about the ice cream (that's like Medicare). Then, you say it's time to do something about the cookies (that's like Social Security). Now, someone comes along and says they want a candy solution (that's like Medicaid). Since you were talking about ice cream and cookies, the candy solution doesn't exactly follow what you were discussing before. They're all sweet treats, but the candy is a different topic.

Mr Hendry led the independent review which supported the plans. He met business leaders and assembly members about the plan. Mr Hendry said he had never seen such enthusiasm among local people and businesses about a project of this scale. The UK Government is considering the findings of his year-long review into the viability of tidal lagoons. Ministers were, he said, being \\"quite tight lipped\\" about where they stand, but Mr Hendry repeated his view that backing the concept was \\"in the national interest\\". \\"We need to make decisions now for how we generate the power which we know we're going to need in 2020s,\\" he said. \\"We know we've got £100bn to invest in new energy infrastructure - and if we don't get on with that work we are going to to have real crisis as we won't have demand. \\"So if we want that investment to happen, if we want supply chain to invest in creating new jobs then we have to give them the signals to go forward. \\"We can always wait for something better to come along but actually eventually you have to get on a bus - and you've got to say 'I want to get there, I want to go to that destination'.

Gower MP Byron Davies said the project \\"breaks the mould\\" in cross-party support and echoed the call. \\"It is imperative that it is now given a green light so that construction can begin as soon as is possible,\\" he said. Mr Davies, who introduced Mr Hendry at the business and council briefing, said there were \\"no points to be scored here - this is one issue on which we are united\\".

There are several factors to consider while assessing and rating a review, which include clarity, information, specificity, relevance, and balance. 1. Clarity: The review is clear in the sense that it portrays a positive sentiment. The use of the word \\"Nice\\" communicates that the reviewer has a favorable opinion of the subject. However, it is not clear enough to understand the specific aspects that the reviewer finds nice. Consequently, the reader might struggle to make an informed decision based on this review. 2. Information: The review is brief and lacks any detailed information regarding the subject. It does not provide any context, making it difficult for potential customers to understand the aspects that contributed to the reviewer's positive experience. A more informative review would describe particular features, explain whether they met expectations, and mention any outstanding aspects that made it unique or valuable. 3. Specificity: The review does not offer any specific details about the subject. The use of the word \\"Nice\\" is vague, and it does not provide any information about the strengths or weaknesses of the product or service. More specific terms and examples could help potential customers and the business to understand the reviewer's experience and opinion better. 4. Relevance: Since the review does not provide any context or details about the subject, it does not offer any useful information for prospective customers or the business to help them in decision-making. Additionally, it does not address any specific aspects, making it challenging to determine its relevance to the subject. 5. Balance: A well-rounded review should discuss both positive and negative aspects of a product or service. This review only provides a single positive word without elaborating on any weaknesses or areas in which the product or service could be improved, giving it an unbalanced perspective. In conclusion, although the review implies a favorable opinion, it does not provide enough information for the reader to make an informed decision. The lack of context, detail, specificity, relevance, and balance render it of limited use. Therefore, I rate this review a 2 on a scale of 1-5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The service was AWFUL. I manage a restaurant and have also been a server for over 7 years so I know how hard you have to work as a server sometimes. I'm not sure if since it was the end of the night she was grumpy and wanted to go home (I have felt that way many times), not making good money (again I get it), or just not a nice person. Our server's name was Chelsea and whatever was going on she clearly didn't want to be serving us. Our drinks took a long time to come out, so long in fact that we had our appetizer before our cocktails. Once we had them they were very good. When we arrived we had wanted to sit outside but it was full, once we finished our appetizer we saw the outside table leave and asked to move outside. I have had tables do this a million times and while its annoying, you accommodate with a smile because thats your job. We move outside and take as much of our table settings and drinks with us but cannot carry it all-- so Chelsea throws the rest down like she would like to actually be throwing them at our faces. We next ask if there is smoking permitted outside. She very rudely said no as she was hastily walking away. Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you by asking if smoking is aloud outside. We got our food which again was amazing but then we sat for a very long time. Just hanging out hoping someone would help us. I kept looking for our server but couldn't find her so I assumed she had gone home and maybe another server would take care of us. Just then she came over and we asked for our check. Evening finally over. I have never written a bad review before. I work in the restaurant industry and know how frustrating, hard, exhausting it can be. BUT that is NEVER an excuse to be rude to customers. Period.","completion":"The review is a mix of both positive and negative sentiments. On the positive side, the reviewer praises the quality of the food and drinks, stating that they were \\"awesome\\" and \\"great,\\" respectively. They emphasize that they were very pleased with what was served and found that aspect of their experience to be enjoyable. However, on the negative side, the reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction with the service they received, specifically highlighting the poor attitude and behavior of their server, Chelsea. They describe Chelsea's service as \\"AWFUL,\\" mentioning that she seemed grumpy, potentially due to it being the end of her shift or not making good money. The reviewer understands the difficulties of working in the restaurant industry, as they have firsthand experience, but feels that being rude to customers is never excusable. They recount specific incidents, such as the drinks taking a long time to be served, their request to move outside being met with annoyance, and rude behavior when they asked about smoking outside. Additionally, they mention waiting for a long time for service toward the end of their meal, which left them feeling frustrated. In conclusion, the reviewer is torn between their appreciation for the food and drinks and their disappointment with the service they received, specifically from their server. While the review contains both positive and negative elements, the focus on the negative aspects of their experience — particularly the server's attitude and actions — suggests that the overall tone of the review leans more negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Which two tribes combined to defeat General Custer's forces at the Battle of Little Big Horn?","completion":"The Battle of Little Big Horn, also known as Custer's Last Stand, took place on June 25-26, 1876, near the Little Big Horn River in eastern Montana Territory. The battle took place between the U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer, and a combined force of Native American tribes, primarily the Lakota Sioux and the Cheyenne. Custer and his forces suffered a devastating defeat, resulting in the deaths of Custer and all the men under his immediate command. The two tribes that combined to defeat General Custer's forces at the Battle of Little Big Horn comprised: 1. The Lakota Sioux: The Sioux or the Dakota are a large group of Native Americans who are historically divided into three major divisions - the Dakota, the Nakota, and the Lakota. The Lakota Sioux division comprised of several individual tribes, and they resided mainly in what is today known as South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. The Lakota Sioux were fierce and skilled warriors who fiercely defended their territory from settlers and the U.S. military. In the Battle of the Little Big Horn, the Lakota Sioux united under the leadership of iconic chiefs, including Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. They were determined to protect their lands from encroachment and uphold their way of life. 2. The Cheyenne: The Cheyenne Nation, native to the Great Plains area, was another indigenous tribe that joined forces with the Lakota Sioux to battle against Custer's forces. Traditionally living in semi-permanent villages, the Cheyenne moved toward a nomadic lifestyle following the acquisition of horses and the expansion westward. Their society became focused on hunting bison and engaging in trade, both of which required unrestricted access to their lands. At Little Big Horn, the Cheyenne were led by skilled warriors and chiefs such as Two Moon and Lame White Man. The Cheyenne combined forces with the Lakota Sioux to form a large and unified Native American army, which brought together thousands of warriors to defend their lands and way of life. The combination of the Lakota Sioux and the Cheyenne played a crucial role in the outcome of the Battle of Little Big Horn. Both tribes had a strong motivation to protect their territory and their rights to hunt and live according to their ancestral ways. The unity and cooperation between these tribes, along with their familiarity with the terrain and superior numbers, contributed significantly to their victory over Custer's forces. In conclusion, it was the joint forces of the Lakota Sioux and the Cheyenne tribes that defeated General Custer's forces at the Battle of Little Big Horn. The unity and strategic organization of these Native American tribes, along with their determination to maintain their lands and their way of life, successfully led them to overcome the U.S. Army in one of the most infamous battles in American history. The battle served as a symbol of Native American resistance and as a turning point in U.S. government policy toward Native American nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The main part of the brain is the cerebral cortex."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who held a position for 33 years? ? Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years. His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the Hôtel-Dieu in Beaune. It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440. Furthermore, when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from écorcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s. The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \\"Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune\\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages. In the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that \\"disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\" In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily. Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece,...

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state. Rarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum. It is...

Justification: The provided text states that Trump was elated after their meeting, and he felt a great chemistry with Kim. This suggests that Trump might be interested in meeting with Kim Jong Un again to continue their discussions and build upon their relationship. Additionally, Trump has made a surprising announcement about suspending joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula, which also indicates a willingness to cooperate and engage with North Korea in future discussions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid.

If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Story: Two neighboring regions were exposed to different levels of abiotic stress. Eastern region was exposed to high levels of abiotic stress, while Western region was almost stress-free.

Usage: \\"If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.\\" This means that there is a relationship between abiotic stress and biodiversity - if the environment is highly stressful, there will be fewer species living in that area. Part #2: Read the story and identify the key information regarding abiotic stress. Usage: \\"Eastern region was exposed to high levels of abiotic stress, while Western region was almost stress-free.\\" This tells us that Eastern region has high abiotic stress, and Western region has low abiotic stress. Part #3: Understand the question and connect it with the relationship described in the background paragraph. Usage: \\"Which region had fewer animal species inhabiting it?\\" This question asks which region has lower biodiversity, which can be answered by applying the understanding of the relationship between abiotic stress and biodiversity. Part #4: Combine the knowledge acquired in the previous parts to formulate an answer using a span from either the story or the question. Usage: \\"Eastern region\\" - this region had high levels of abiotic stress, which, according to the background paragraph, leads to lower biodiversity. Therefore, Eastern region had fewer animal species inhabiting it."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: First Spaceship on Venus Movie plot: In 1985 engineers involved in an industrial project to irrigate the Gobi Desert accidentally unearth a mysterious and apparently artificial \\"spool\\". When found to be made of a material unknown on Earth, the spool is circumstantially linked to the Tunguska explosion of 1908. The spool is seized on as evidence that the explosion, originally blamed on a meteor, was actually caused by an alien spaceship. Professor Harringway deduces the craft must have come from Venus. The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tchen Yu. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer. When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna's efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth's surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to an invasion. Rather than containing a \\"cosmic document\\", as had been expected, the spool bears a cold-blooded message of destruction. Harringway convinces the crew to press on towards Venus rather than return to Earth with news that would panic mankind. With the ship's robot, Omega, American astronaut Brinkman pilots a one-man landing craft. On the ground, he encounters an industrial complex and finds small recording devices that look like insects. The rest of the crew follows when Cosmostrator lands, but they find no Venusian life forms. Journeying across the planet, they find the remains of a deserted and blasted city centered around a huge crater, signs of a catastrophic explosion so intense that shadowy forms of humanoid Venusians are permanently burned on to...

The opening scene sees \\"The Man\\" being approached and attacked by two muggers in a dark alley of London. As the muggers check their seemingly unconscious victim for cash, The Man regains consciousness and brutally kills them. Around that time, Inspector Peter Neilson is investigating the apparent murder scene of the young Melissa and Nikki. In a flashback, the two girls are shown in a goth club looking to pick up men. Melissa spotted The Man and took him home. After spending the night with him, she began hallucinating about the people around turning to her with monstrous faces and voices. Melissa went to Nikki's house to seek help, then a creature burst out of Melissa's womb and attacked Nikki, killing both. Sophie and Emma break into a house in a burglary attempt. When Emma finds a box of money under a bed, a bony old man pops up from the bedcovers and attacks her. The girls stab and bludgeon the old man multiple times before he finally dies. Intending to keep the loot to herself and seeing Emma as a liability for revealing their plan to her sister, Sophie kills Emma and runs home. There, the re-animated bodies of Emma and the old man appear and stab Sophie to death. As the dead bodies are identified, Inspector Neilson links them to an earlier case he had solved in the past. The case involved a man named Kemper, former hypnotist and son of an infamous Satanist. Kemper had been using his skills to manipulate, abduct and kill children for over 25 years until he was apprehended by Neilson, tried and committed to a lunatic asylum.

It expresses an opinion or belief about something without being certain. - \\"you're going to\\" is a future tense construction in English, which implies an intention or plan to perform an action in the future. In Czech, this meaning can be conveyed using the future form of the verb \\"to be\\" (\\"být\\") combined with the infinitive form of the main verb. In this context, we use \\"napravíte\\", which is the future form of \\"napravit\\" (meaning: to put right, to correct, to fix). - \\"put things right\\" is translated as \\"věci napravíte\\" (meaning: to fix or correct things, to make things right). It's a general expression indicating the intention to solve problems or make amends.

In the first sentence, \\"He lost his place on the page,\\" the term \\"place\\" refers to the location or position of something, in this case, the particular line or section of the page that the person was reading or focusing on. When someone loses their place on the page, it usually means they have become distracted or have temporarily forgotten where they were in the text and need to find the last point they remember. In this context, \\"place\\" has a spatial connotation, as it is concerned with one's position within the text. In the second sentence, \\"A political system with no place for the less prominent groups,\\" the word \\"place\\" takes on a more metaphorical and abstract meaning. Here, it is used to describe the role, presence or significance of the less prominent groups within the political system.

Possible answers: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","completion":"(a). yes; Alright, let me explain this to you like you are 5 years old: Premise means a fact or situation that is the starting point for an idea or story. So, when we say \\"Look out for the remains of a marble-covered Byzantine road (fourth- to 14th-century) that once connected Lefkes with the nearby village of Karampoli down in the valley,\\" it means that a long time ago, there was a pretty marble road that used to help people go from one village called Lefkes to another village called Karampoli. Hypothesis means a smart guess or idea that we can find out by checking if the premise (fact) is true. The hypothesis here is: \\"There used to be a road connecting Lefkes with Karampoli.\\" So, we got this guess from the premise that says there was a road between those villages.

What was supposed to be a fun night out with friends quickly turned into a subpar dining experience that left me questioning the hype around this place. From the lackluster customer service to the forgettable dishes, XYZ restaurant definitely missed the mark. Upon entering the establishment, no one was there to greet us or guide us to our reserved table. It took a good five minutes for a staff member to casually stroll by, and even then, they barely acknowledged us. We were eventually seated in a cramped, noisy spot where our elbows continuously bumped into the people at the neighboring table. As we browsed through the menu, it struck us how limited the choices were. After waiting an unreasonable amount of time for our server to arrive, we were met with an unenthusiastic and uninformed staff member who seemed just as unimpressed with XYZ restaurant as we were! They couldn't answer basic questions about the dishes or make any recommendations when asked. This really should have been our first red flag. When our food finally arrived, it was nothing but a sheer disappointment. The presentation of the dishes was amateurish at best, with no attention to detail or thought given to enhancing the dining experience. Not only that, but the portions were minuscule and the taste was far from what one would expect from a supposedly \\"high-end\\" establishment. My dish, the Grilled Chicken with Seasonal Vegetables, was overcooked with a chewy texture and bland seasoning. The vegetables were soggy, and it seemed as though they had been boiled instead of grilled, completely missing the mark on the flavors we were expecting. Others in our party were equally disappointed with their selections, whether it was the watery risotto or a flavorless pasta dish that was drowning in sauce. The restaurant's atmosphere did not save the experience either. The noise level was unbearable, making it difficult for us to listen to each other, let alone enjoy any semblance of a conversation. The decor seemed outdated and uninspired, with no unique nor charming aspects to it, creating an unpleasant dining ambiance. To add to our frustration, the service continued to decline throughout the evening. Waitstaff often seemed to disappear, leaving our water glasses empty and dirty dishes on our table long after we'd finished eating. When it came time to settle the check, we had to wait twenty minutes just to get our server's attention. Overall, my experience at XYZ restaurant was a major letdown. What was meant to be a lovely evening out was marred by poor service, an unappealing atmosphere, and, above all, substandard food. It is safe to say that I will not be recommending XYZ restaurant to anyone and certainly won't be returning anytime soon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stephen is researching some very big questions, such as: How did the universe begin? How will it end? Stephen was a student at Oxford University. He studied math and science. Then, at the age of twenty, he became sick. He was so young, but the doctors said to his family, \\"He has only two more years to live.\\" As a matter of fact, the doctors were wrong---- he didn't die. He can't walk now but he uses a wheelchair . He can't feed himself and get in or out of bed himself. But he refused to give in to the condition. He talks with the help of a computer. After Oxford, Stephen went to Cambridge University. Three years later, in 1965, he became a doctor of philosophy . Because of his serious health problems, it was difficult for him to draw diagrams or to write. So he started to think in pictures. With this new way of thinking, he became one of the most famous scientists in the world. In 1991, he met the Pope in Rome. They talked about his ideas. Then in 1998, he wrote his first important book, A Brief History of Time. It sold more than 5.5 million copies in 33 different languages.

Twelve three-hundredths (12/300) expresssed as a percentage is?","completion":"To express the fraction twelve three-hundredths (12/300) as a percentage, you'll need to follow these steps: 1. Simplify the fraction: Twelve three-hundredths written as a fraction is 12/300. The first step in converting this fraction to a percentage is to simplify it. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator (12) and denominator (300). The GCD of 12 and 300 is 12. Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (12), which will simplify the fraction: 12 ÷ 12 = 1 300 ÷ 12 = 25 So, the simplified fraction is 1/25. 2. Convert the simplified fraction to a decimal: To convert a fraction to a decimal, you'll need to divide the numerator (1) by the denominator (25). 1 ÷ 25 = 0.04 This means that the simplified fraction 1/25 is equal to the decimal 0.04. 3. Convert the decimal to a percentage: To convert a decimal to a percentage, simply multiply it by 100 and add the percentage sign (%). 0.04 × 100 = 4% So, twelve three-hundredths (12/300) expressed as a percentage is 4%."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county. - Montesquieu University ( French : Université Montesquieu ) is a French university , based in Pessac , the suburbs of Bordeaux , in the domaine universitaire .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In the twinkle of an eye, Israel Folau has accomplished what most athletes would be happy to achieve in an entire career -- and in his case he has done it in three sports. Since bursting onto the scene in 2007, the Australian has made his considerable presence felt in not one but three oval-ball codes, weighing in with match-winning performances in Rugby League, Aussie Rules football and, most recently, Rugby Union. Still only 25, Folau is now reaching his athletic peak and keen for the second half of his career to be just as successful as the first in which he has become a try scorer par excellence. \\"Everything's going to plan, the way I would have liked it,\\" Folau told CNN's Human to Hero series. \\"There's hopefully a long way to go in my career.\\" Affectionately known as \\"Izzy,\\" Folau was born in the Sydney suburb of Minto to parents of Tongan descent. One of six siblings, Folau recalls being encouraged to participate in sports from an early age. \\"They were a very, very big part of my career growing up. I think probably all of my determination and eagerness to want to play professional sport came from my family.\\" Folau began his professional Rugby League career at the age of 17, scoring a record 36 tries for Melbourne Storm in his rookie season. His raw talent earned him a call-up to the national squad becoming the youngest-ever player to represent the Kangeroos -- though his record of 18 years and 194 days was recently eclipsed by Sione Mata'utia. The following year, he rubber-stamped his status as an emerging star with a further 37 tries in 39 games, this time for the Brisbane Broncos. It was incredible start by any measure, but Folau took it all in his stride. \\"I probably realized when I was maybe 13 years of age that I could make a living out of playing professional sport and from that time on it was really a goal for me do that as soon as I can.\\" Intimidating presence. Weighing in at just over 100 kg (220 lbs) and standing 1.95 m (6'5\\") tall, Folau is, like his childhood idol, former New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu, an intimidating physical presence on the pitch. A hefty frame allied to explosive turns of speed make Folau a real handful for opposition defenses. He is also incredibly agile for a big man, capable of salmon-like leaps to catch the high ball. \\"I get excited when the ball goes up in the air. I try to always get up there ... I get a buzz out of it. I am always trying to work at it.\\" Having excelled at both club and international levels -- he scored six tries in eight appearances for the Kangeroos -- Folau inevitably attracted the attention of Rugby Union scouts. But rather than making what has become a routine switch between the 13 and 15-man codes, Folau opted to take a detour, signing for Australian Football League (AFL) side, the Greater Western Sydney Giants in 2011. \\"There are different reasons why I wanted to try AFL -- some of them family reasons and others were more personal ones,\\" he explains of a route taken by only a handful of Australian Rugby League players in the past. \\"I wanted to challenge myself, you know, take myself out of my comfort zone.\\" His two seasons in AFL didn't hit the heights reached in Rugby League but, as he has admitted in previous interviews, it was extremely rewarding financially. It wasn't just his bank balance that profited though, his all-round game did too, he says. \\"My time in AFL improved my kicking and, you know, I dropped a lot of weight when I was playing AFL, so I got to be a lot fitter. It has helped me a lot,\\" he said. Union star. A comparatively quiet period in AFL exploded back into life when Folau signed for the Rugby Union side New South Wales Waratahs for the 2013 season. Cementing his place at fullback, Folau impressed with 20 tries in his debut season and he was drafted into the international squad to face the British and Irish Lions touring side. Folau's impact was immediate as he ran in two tries -- the second a sensational solo effort that lit up the Brisbane's Suncorp stadium -- earning him the Man of the Match award. Folau would end the year scoring a total of 10 international tries, equaling the Australian record for a season set by Lote Tuqiri in 2004. To date, he has scored 17 times in 29 appearances. Show-stopping cameos on the pitch have inevitably increased his profile off it, but Folau has remained focused, says former Australia coach, Ewen McKenzie. \\"Sometimes success can get in the way and people get confused, sidetracked and distracted, but he's just a very consistent operator,\\" McKenzie told The New York Times in August. \\"He's difficult to contain. If you can get him in a one-on-one situation, he's going to get you a pretty good outcome. \\"He's a pretty big guy, he's got good skills, and he's pretty measured off the field. He's a very quiet, humble guy who is always smiling and laughing.\\" After being voted Wallabies Rookie of the Year in 2013, Folau was honored again this year, winning the John Eales Medal -- an annual award given to the best Australian player of the year. Folau's talents seem to ensure that he will be singled out for some time to come, but it's being part of a team that he enjoys the most. \\"It's the best thing about it. You know, you get to enjoy the ups and downs together as a team, so you ride the emotions together. For me, I really enjoy the camaraderie and the things that you form within the team.\\" With a World Cup in England to look forward to next year, Folau and his teammates will be aiming to win the William Webb Ellis trophy for a third time. Given the Wallabies recent run of form -- a disappointing five-match tour of Europe in November yielded just two victories -- that looks unlikely, but whatever happens Folau won't be taking his foot off the gas as he looks to continue repaying the sporting debt owed to his family. \\"Coming to Australia from overseas to try and give us an opportunity to make something out of living in Australia was a huge thing for me so I wanted to probably give back a bit,\\" he says. \\"In a way I wanted to work hard and play at a professional level to help them out. It's always been a key part of my success and always will be to the day of my retirement.\\" Read more: Cancer, amputation no barrier for champion thrower.

The correct option is \\"quietness\\" because it refers to the low level of noise or absence of loud disturbances in the environment. In this context, the quietness allows even the smallest sounds to be more noticeable and amplified. The other options, such as \\"silent\\" and \\"silence,\\" may seem somewhat relevant but they suggest a complete absence of sound, which is not the case here as there is a softly hummed hymn. The term \\"quite\\" does not fit because it is an adverb implying a level of emphasis and \\"music\\" is not suitable since it is too general and does not convey the specific aspect of low noise levels being referred to in the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor. New products are continually being made from peanuts, among them peanut cheese and a powder that becomes peanut butter when water is added. The fact is that peanuts are so healthy...

The answer is:","completion":"The term used to describe an institution/building that stems from the Latin word for stranger or visitor is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, the term you might be looking for is \\"hospitium,\\" which originates from the Latin words \\"hospes\\" (host, stranger, or visitor) and \\"hospitare\\" (to receive as a guest).
