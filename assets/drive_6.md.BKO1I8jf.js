Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as the television hostess of late-night horror films, and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. She reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK was the result. The plot is flyweight. Television horror film hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great aunt dies, she travels to New England in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show; she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house, a poodle, and an old book. It happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description, and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes. It also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on \\"the old book.\\" Throw in a few teenagers, a stud muffin, and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go. No one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece, and it does drag now and then. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish: squirmy, sexy, and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy, she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self-mocking jokes. From a FLASHDANCE disaster to witchcraft craziness, she is never less than wildly entertaining. It's a tremendous amount of fun, and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense. Will Elvira best her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun finding out. DVD quality is okay and there's little in the way of bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge.

Title: The King and the Clown Movie plot: Set in the early 16th century during the reign of King Yeonsan, two male street clowns and tightrope walkers, Jang-saeng and Gong-gil, are part of an entertainer troupe. Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the King, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but his pleas fall on deaf ears.The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil. The Counsel Members tries to have him killed during a hunting trip, resulting in the death of one of the members of the street performing team.

Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will have to pick an adventure sport, which all three will try together.

Imraan has an additional personal agenda on the tripto find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain.The trio set off to Spain, where they plan to visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imraan and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran casually throws Arjun's phone out of their car while he was in the middle of an important call. This leads to a misunderstanding, which ends up in a violent argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imraan of having an affair, four years back, with Arjun's previous girlfriend (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After getting consoled by Kabir and reaching their destination, they meet an Indian American named Laila (Katrina Kaif) in a beach. Imraan flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous.

Q: In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired. The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases. I am facing a new situation today: David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would camera A have higher or lower beam quality? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article you've provided, camera A, with the smaller pinhole, would likely have a higher beam quality as compared to camera B with the larger aperture. The reason for this rests in the trade-off between aperture size, beam quality, and the power of the beam. When a smaller aperture or pinhole is used, the beam quality is generally improved due to the reduction in diffraction and other aberrations that can occur with larger apertures. In this context, we can associate beam quality with image sharpness and clarity, which are important factors for photography. However, the smaller aperture also reduces the amount of light entering the camera, which in turn affects the overall brightness, power, and exposure of the photographs. On the other hand, a larger aperture, as in camera B, allows more light to enter the camera, which could yield better results in low-light situations or faster shutter speeds to capture motion. However, the trade-off for this increased light input is that the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired, potentially leading to lower image clarity or sharpness. Considering David's needs, if the photography class mostly involves well-lit scenarios requiring high sharpness and image clarity, camera A might be a better choice. However, if David requires versatility and better low-light performance, camera B may be more suitable. It is essential to note that additional factors, such as the quality of the lens and other camera features, cannot be overlooked when making a final choice. Furthermore, the balance between aperture size, beam quality, and lens quality plays a significant role in determining the camera's overall photographic performance. Therefore, David should consider this information to make an informed decision tailored to his specific needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

We have the equation: 0 = 92c - 73c + 133c + 7448 First, we need to find how many \\"c\\" pieces we have. Like adding apples, we need to put all the \\"c\\" parts together.

We can do that by subtracting 7448 from both sides. 0 - 7448 = -7448 (0 minus 7448) 152c = -7448 Now we need to divide both sides by 152 to find \\"c.\\" -7448 ÷ 152 = -49 (-7448 divided by 152) So, the answer is c = -49. Imagine we have 152 \\"c\\" pieces in one bag and -7448 pieces of candy in another. If \\"c\\" pieces represent -49 candies each, then we have 152 times -49 candies which gives us -7448 candies.

Write a title: IT IS A TRUTH UNIVERSALLY acknowledged that Jane Austen was probably not an Aston Villa fan, but she summed up the angst of the clubs supporters when she wrote: One has no great hopes from Birmingham.","completion":"Title: Austen's Aston Villa Paradox: From Literary Reflection to Modern Football Incarnation Introduction: It is interesting to ponder whether the great Jane Austen would have found herself supporting Aston Villa had she lived in our modern times. Although it seems highly unlikely, given her early 19th-century context and refined, romantic demeanor, one cannot resist the charm of pondering this idea. This essay delves deep into the hypothetical realm to examine Jane Austen's potential relationship with Aston Villa, offering a fresh perspective on both the English novelist's work and the struggles of the football club, which resonate remarkably well with Birmingham's broader social and economic complexities. A Birmingham in Austen's Time: When Jane Austen referred to Birmingham in her novel, \\"Emma,\\" she was describing a city beginning to emerge as an epicenter of the Industrial Revolution. As such, Birmingham was experiencing remarkable growth in its population and infrastructure, but at the same time it was struggling with its fair share of social and economic problems. As a keen observer of her society, Austen perceived these issues and her remark on having \\"no great hopes from Birmingham\\" sheds light on the city's challenges. Today, Birmingham's socio-political landscape has evolved significantly since Austen's time, but her observations still hold relevance as the city continues to grapple with new and persistent difficulties. Aston Villa and the Modern Birmingham Angst: Established in 1874, Aston Villa Football Club has a storied history intertwined with the city of Birmingham. Once a powerhouse in English football, Aston Villa has experienced turbulent times as they strive to find success on and off the field. The club's struggle to return to the esteemed ranks of footballing excellence echoes Austen's pessimism about Birmingham in her time. Furthermore, the team's fate reflects the city's broader struggles with identity, socio-economic disparities, and political turbulence. Jane Austen's Hypothetical Fandom: To imagine Jane Austen as an Aston Villa fan, one must first consider the values that the English novelist held dear – wit, social commentary, and moral reflection. Austen's ability to create well-rounded characters, who exist in a complex social environment, demonstrates her profound understanding of human nature. The inherent drama in football games - the confrontations, displays of skill and strategy, and the shared camaraderie of a fan community - all possess elements that Jane Austen could have appreciated in a modern context. It is not inconceivable that the highs and lows of Aston Villa's journey, had she been a part of the football zeitgeist, might have provided fertile ground for her expressive genius. Conclusion: While Jane Austen might seem an unlikely Aston Villa fan, the idea serves as a novel lens through which we can appraise both her literary prowess and the football club's ongoing tribulations. Indeed, the social and economic uncertainties pervading the city of Birmingham both in the early 19th century and in today's contemporary context are fascinatingly mirrored in the fluctuating fortunes of Aston Villa. In the end, the title \\"Austen's Aston Villa Paradox\\" aptly encapsulates the intriguing exploration of two seemingly disconnected entities coming together in an unexpected, yet meaningful, discourse."},{"prompt":"Two brothers loved geology. Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother studied more about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup? Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake.

Please answer the following question: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. Would Neptune have slower or faster speed than Earth? A:","completion":"Planet Neptune has a slower orbital speed compared to Earth. This is due to the combination of its greater distance from the Sun and the gravitational forces at play in our solar system. Neptune is, on average, around 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) away from the Sun, while Earth is just 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) away. As a result, Neptune's orbit is much larger than Earth's, and it takes the planet much longer to complete a full trip around the Sun. The orbital speed of a planet depends on the force exerted by the Sun's gravity and the distance of the planet from the Sun. According to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, planets closer to the Sun have higher orbital speeds because the gravitational force is stronger. Conversely, planets farther away from the Sun have lower orbital speeds due to weaker gravitational force. In the case of Neptune and Earth, Neptune's average orbital speed is about 5.43 kilometers per second (3.37 miles per second), while Earth's average orbital speed is around 29.78 kilometers per second (18.50 miles per second). This means that Earth is moving through space at a much faster pace than Neptune due to its closer proximity to the Sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And the answer is?","completion":"The US president who greeted astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin when they returned from their historic moon landing mission on Apollo 11 was Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon served as the 37th president of the United States from January 20, 1969, to August 9, 1974. The Apollo 11 mission, which carried the three astronauts to the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969, and successfully returned to Earth on July 24, 1969. It was during Nixon's first year in office that this significant event took place. After the safe recovery of the astronauts from the Pacific Ocean by the USS Hornet, President Nixon was aboard the ship to personally congratulate and welcome the astronauts back to Earth. This momentous occasion was also broadcasted on television, reaching millions of viewers. However, due to the concern of possible lunar microorganisms contaminating Earth, the astronauts were immediately placed in a Mobile Quarantine Facility upon their return. In order to greet the astronauts, President Nixon had to communicate with them through a window of this quarantine unit. The astronauts were released from quarantine on August 10, 1969, after completing the mandatory 21-day isolation period to ensure no harmful contaminants were brought back to Earth. Following their release, President Nixon hosted a series of events to honor their achievement, including an official state dinner held on August 13, 1969, at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. This event, famously known as the \\"Giant Leap\\" gala, featured 1,440 guests, making it one of the largest state dinners in US history. In summary, President Richard Nixon greeted and welcomed astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin upon their return from the moon during the Apollo 11 mission.

Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film. But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote \\"gun rights\\" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish. Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people? I highly doubt it. But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK. This is the key message of this part of the animation, which is again being ignored by its critics. Buell shooting in Flint. You write: \\"Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before\\". This characterization of a six-year-old as a pencil-stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against. It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset. The kid was a little bastard, and the parents were involved in drugs -- case closed. But why do people deal with drugs? Because it's so much fun to do so? It is by now well documented that the CIA tolerated crack sales in US cities to fund the operation of South American \\"contras\\" It is equally well known that the so-called \\"war on drugs\\" begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population (both in relative and absolute numbers). Do you have any questions?","completion":"I understand the points you have raised regarding the animated history of the US and \\"gun rights,\\" as well as the issue about the Buell shooting in Flint. From what you have mentioned, it is clear that gun rights in the 19th century were primarily for white individuals, and the NRA in the southern states may not have actively promoted gun rights for black people. This suggests that the message in the animation aims to bring attention to the racism that continues within certain organizations and laws. Regarding the Buell shooting in Flint, you raise valid concerns about labels and prejudices that might further worsen the situation. It is important to assess the issues that contribute to such incidents, such as the drug problem and the CIA's involvement in crack sales in US cities. It is also crucial to recognize the failure of the war on drugs and its contribution to the increased prison population in the US. To better address these concerns and offer insights into potential solutions, I have a few questions: 1. In your opinion, what are some proactive steps we can take to address and combat the racial disparities in gun laws and their enforcement in the United States? 2. While not overlooking the child's aggressive actions, how can society approach situations like the Buell shooting with more empathy and understanding, taking into account the underlying issues that lead to such events? 3. Given the well-documented failures of the war on drugs, what alternative strategies can be implemented to tackle drug-related issues and reduce crime rates and the prison population in the United States? 4.

Which may sound odd coming from someone who ceaselessly praises love and sex, but it is true. I am not a fan. My mother and father were married in a small Baptist Church on Valentine’s Day in 1959. They are no longer together. They are still technically married but my father now lives in a residential care home for dementia patients and my mother lives alone. My father’s disease makes him angry and aggressive leaving my mother with blurred and fading memories of his kindness. It is a sad day for all those whose partners are transformed into strangers by illnesses. Some things aren’t fair. It is my step(ish) daughter’s birthday on Valentine’s Day (I am not married to my boyfriend so I can’t claim to be a step-mum and there is no other term for it). The end of my boyfriend’s marriage has put continents between him and his children. When he hangs up the phone after talking to his daughter, his eyes are dark with pain. It is a sad day for all those whose love is diluted by oceans. Some things can’t be changed. I remember the last Valentine’s Day I spent with my ex-husband. I was a couple of weeks away from moving out but I hadn’t told him yet. I felt sick and scared and heartbroken. My husband and I passed the entire day without speaking. As I stood on the edge of the cliff summoning up the courage to jump, I felt entirely alone. It is a sad day for all those whose love has withered away. Some things can’t be fixed. I want to believe that “love is all you need” because it feels as though it could almost be true, but then I remember, on days like this, that for as many hearts that sing, there are equally as many that struggle to beat.

'Nova puts nail in Siena, scampers into Sweet 16 By Andy Gardiner, USA TODAY TAMPA  A Villanova team that was one of the last at-large selections for the NCAA men's tournament marched into the Sweet 16 Sunday by puncturing Siena's upset bubble, 84-72 at the St. Pete Times Forum. Guards Scottie Reynolds and Corey Stokes combined for 45 points as the No. 12 Wildcats (22-12) broke to an early lead and never let the 13th-seeded Saints (23-11) mount a serious comeback. Villanova will play No. 1 seed Kansas in a Midwest Regional semifinal Friday in Detroit. \\"We went through some ups and downs during the season, but we always stayed consistent about what we were trying to accomplish,\\" Reynolds said. \\"The last two or three weeks we've been playing our best basketball.\\" Siena led wire-to-wire in defeating No. 4 Vanderbilt 83-62 in the opening round, shooting 56.5% from the field, 45% from three-point distance and 88% at the line. But the Wildcats defended the perimeter more aggressively than the Commodores. The Saints were 20-for-56 (35.7%), hit only six of 21 three-pointers, and missed 13 of 39 free throws. \\"This game for us was a struggle at the start,\\" said Siena coach Fran McCaffery. \\"We got down early, and I think the mistake we made was we tried to quit shooting the ball a little bit.\\" Villanova fell behind by 18 points in the first half Friday before rallying to oust No. 5 Clemson 75-69. Coach Jay Wright wanted to avoid a slow start against Siena at all costs. \\"Siena is such a smart team, I was scared to death we'd fall behind early,\\" he said. \\"We wouldn't be able to press them and get them out of what they do.\\" The Wildcats avoided that by racing to a 19-5 lead in the first seven minutes with Reynolds and Stokes teaming for 15 of those points. Siena's challenge became even greater when top scorer Kenny Hasbrouck (30 points vs. Vandy) went to the bench with his second foul with seven minutes left. The Saints trailed 42-32 at the half and never went away in the final 20 minutes. But they never came closer than nine points (67-58 with 6:28 to play). \\"(Keeping a lead) is the hardest thing in sports, it's harder than coming back,\\" Wright said. \\"There's a lot of game pressure on you, a lot of tension. Scottie, I thought was great (at maintaining Villanova's composure).\\" The Wildcats reached the Sweet 16 in 2006, but that was as a No. 1 seed. This was the sixth time in tournament history that a No. 12 seed played a No. 13. The 12th seed has won five. Alex Franklin led Siena with 18 points while Hasbrouck had 17.

Answer: Changes in capital requirements, intended to keep U.S. banks competitive with their European counterparts, allowed lower risk weightings for AAA securities. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: The changes intended to keep U.S. banks competitive with their European counterparts encompassed several aspects, including changes in regulatory measures, capital requirements, and adoption of new technologies. These changes aimed to level the international playing field and promote financial stability. 1. Capital Requirements: U.S. regulators enacted changes in capital requirements to align them with the international standards and recommendations provided by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel Accords (Basel I, II, and III) introduced minimum capital standards, which required banks to hold a specific level of capital in relation to their risk-weighted assets. These requirements aimed to enhance the resilience of banks and reduce the risk of failure during periods of financial stress. These changing requirements allowed lower risk weightings for AAA securities, in turn enabling U.S. banks to optimize their capital allocation and maintain competitiveness with European banks. 2. Regulatory Reforms: In response to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, regulators in the United States and Europe implemented various reforms to strengthen the financial system. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed in the United States in 2010, establishing stricter regulations for banks and other financial institutions, with an emphasis on consumer protection and risk management. Similar regulatory changes were adopted in Europe, including the creation of the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). These reforms aimed to enhance transparency, increase accountability, and improve risk management practices across both U.S. and European banking sectors. 3. Adoption of New Technologies: U.S. banks were also encouraged to adopt new technologies and modernize their operations to stay competitive with European counterparts. This included the use of data analytics, risk management systems, and advanced financial technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. By leveraging technology, U.S. banks were able to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and better meet the evolving demands of their customers. 4. Consolidation and Cross-border Mergers: In an effort to compete with large European banks, U.S. banks undertook mergers and acquisitions to achieve economies of scale and increase profitability. This consolidation led to the expansion of services offered, the diversification of non-interest income sources, and the development of a global banking market. 5. International Expansion: U.S. banks expanded their operations in international markets to capitalize on growth opportunities and compete with European banks at a global level. By increasing their presence in foreign markets, U.S. banks could offer a wider range of products and services to customers, diversify their sources of revenue, and access better market intelligence. In conclusion, changes in capital requirements, regulatory reforms, adoption of new technologies, consolidation, and international expansion were among the key strategies implemented by U.S. banks to maintain competitiveness with their European counterparts. These changes aimed to strengthen the U.S. banking system, promote financial stability, and ensure the global competitiveness of the American financial industry."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Please answer the following question: Just minutes after Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, the president was blunt about his long-standing differences with his former secretary of state. “We disagreed on things,” Trump told reporters outside the White House, specifically pointing to friction over the Iran nuclear agreement. “I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump said. “We were really not thinking the same.” Trump reportedly had considered firing Tillerson for months. But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: Who was sent south with eight European children? from the following article ? A young idealistic schoolteacher named Ruth Kirke is transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta when their steamship Tollare is torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific. Along with sailor Timothy Blake, they are the only passengers to survive the enemy attack. They are picked up by the steamship Westonia and taken to San Francisco, where immigration officials inform Ruth that the orphans will be held until a 500 bond is posted for each child. With no money of their own, Ruth and Timothy go to the home of Commodore Thomas Spencer Holliday, the wealthy owner of their sunken cargo ship, who perished during the torpedo attack. When they appeal for financial assistance for the orphans, the commodore's family refuses. Desperate to help the children, Timothy tells the commodore's family that Ruth and the commodore were married aboard the Tollare before it was attacked. With the children's future at stake, Ruth reluctantly goes along with the deception. Ruth, Timothy, and the eight orphans move into the Holliday mansion, where they soon meet the commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III. When a sceptical Tom questions Ruth about how she became his grandmother, Ruth explains that her Christian mission was destroyed in a Japanese bombing raid, and that she was sent south with eight European children, entrusted with their safety. Along the way, they encountered a dying Chinese woman, and Ruth agreed to care for her child as well. Moved by her personal story and her beautiful singing voice, Tom is soon smitten with the young woman. The answer is:","completion":"Ruth Kirke was sent south with eight European children.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 11*r - 2074 + 1786 = -7*r for r.","completion":"Sure, let's solve this little puzzle step by step, like we are trying to solve a secret code. We start with the equation: 11*r - 2074 + 1786 = -7*r. To make it easier, let's bring all the terms with 'r' on one side. So, we'll take -7*r from the right side to the left. When we change sides with a term, we change its sign. So, -7*r will become +7*r on the left side. The equation now looks like this: 11*r + 7*r - 2074 + 1786 = 0. We can simplify it further by adding the r's together and the numbers together. 11*r + 7*r gives us 18*r, and -2074 + 1786 becomes -288. So now the equation looks like this: 18*r - 288 = 0. Let's bring the -288 to the other side of the equation to make it all tidy. It's a rule, like we said before, when we change sides with a term, we change its sign. So -288 will become +288 on the right: 18*r = 288. We're nearly there. Right now, this equation says \\"18 times some number equals 288\\". But we want to know what that \\"some number\\" (our 'r') is, so we need to get 'r' alone. We do this by doing the opposite of multiplying by 18, which is dividing by 18: r = 288 / 18. Lastly, when you do the division you find out that 'r' equals 16. Therefore, the solution to the equation is r = 16. It's like the treasure at the end of our math adventure! Remember it as solving a puzzle: we moved pieces around (rawr! like a little math-dinosaur) following the rules until we found our missing number."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.

DNA Deciphers Roots of Modern Europeans For centuries, archaeologists have reconstructed the early history of Europe by digging up ancient settlements and examining the items that their inhabitants left behind. More recently, researchers have been scrutinizing something even more revealing than pots, chariots and swords: DNA. On Wednesday in the journal Nature, two teams of scientists — one based at the University of Copenhagen and one based at Harvard University — presented the largest studies to date of ancient European DNA, extracted from 170 skeletons found in countries from Spain to Russia. Both studies indicate that today’s Europeans descend from three groups who moved into Europe at different stages of history. The first were hunter-gatherers who arrived some 45,000 years ago in Europe. Then came farmers who arrived from the Near East about 8,000 years ago. Finally, a group of nomadic sheepherders from western Russia called the Yamnaya arrived about 4,500 years ago. The authors of the new studies also suggest that the Yamnaya language may have given rise to many of the languages spoken in Europe today. Ron Pinhasi, an archaeologist at University College Dublin who was not involved in either study, said that the new studies were “a major game-changer. To me, it marks a new phase in ancient DNA research.” The two teams worked independently, studying different skeletons and using different methods to analyze their DNA. The Harvard team collected DNA from 69 human remains dating back 8,000 years and cataloged the genetic variations at almost 400,000 different points. The Copenhagen team collected DNA from 101 skeletons dating back about 3,400 years and sequenced the entire genomes. Both teams also compared the newly sequenced DNA to genes retrieved from other ancient Europeans and Asians, and to living humans. Until about 9,000 years ago, Europe was home to a genetically distinct population of hunter-gatherers, the researchers found. Then, between 9,000 and 7,000 years ago, the genetic profiles of the inhabitants in some parts of Europe abruptly changed, acquiring DNA from Near Eastern populations. Archaeologists have long known that farming practices spread into Europe at the time from Turkey. But the new evidence shows that it wasn’t just the ideas that spread — the farmers did, too. The hunter-gatherers didn’t disappear, however. They managed to survive in pockets across Europe between the farming communities. “It’s an amazing cultural process,” said David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School who led the university’s team. “You have groups which are as genetically distinct as Europeans and East Asians. And they’re living side by side for thousands of years.” Between 7,000 and 5,000 years ago, however, hunter-gatherer DNA began turning up in the genes of European farmers. “There’s a breakdown of these cultural barriers, and they mix,” said Dr. Reich. About 4,500 years ago, the final piece of Europe’s genetic puzzle fell into place. A new infusion of DNA arrived — one that is still very common in living Europeans, especially in central and northern Europe. The closest match to this new DNA, both teams of scientists found, comes from skeletons found in Yamnaya graves in western Russia and Ukraine. Archaeologists have long been fascinated by the Yamnaya, who left behind artifacts on the steppes of western Russia and Ukraine dating from 5,300 to 4,600 years ago. The Yamnaya used horses to manage huge herds of sheep, and followed their livestock across the steppes with wagons full of food and water. It was an immensely successful way of life, allowing the Yamnaya to build huge funeral mounds for their dead, which they filled with jewelry, weapons and even entire chariots. David W. Anthony, an archaeologist at Hartwick College and a co-author on the Harvard study, said it was likely that the expansion of Yamnaya into Europe was relatively peaceful. “It wasn’t Attila the Hun coming in and killing everybody,” he said. Instead, Dr. Anthony thought the most likely scenario was that the Yamnaya “entered into some kind of stable opposition” with the resident Europeans that lasted for a few centuries. But then gradually the barriers between the cultures eroded. The Copenhagen team’s study suggests that the Yamnaya didn’t just expand west into Europe, however. The scientists examined DNA from 4,700-year-old skeletons from a Siberian culture called the Afanasievo. It turns out that they inherited Yamnaya DNA, too. Dr. Anthony was surprised by the possibility that Yamnaya pushed out over a range of about 4,000 miles. “I myself have a hard time wrapping my head around explanations for that,” he said. The two studies also add new fuel to a debate about how languages spread across Europe and Asia. Most European tongues belong to the Indo-European family, which also incudes languages in southern and Central Asia. For decades, linguists have debated how Indo-European got to Europe. Some favor the idea that the original farmers brought Indo-European into Europe from Turkey. Others think the language came from the Russian steppes thousands of years later. The new genetic results won’t settle the debate, said Eske Willerslev, an evolutionary biologist at Copenhagen University who led the Danish team. But he did think the results were consistent with the idea that the Yamnaya brought Indo-European from the steppes to Europe. The eastward expansion of Yamnaya, evident in the genetic findings, also supports the theory, Dr. Willerslev said. Linguists have long puzzled over an Indo-European language once spoken in western China called Tocharian. It is only known from 1,200-year-old manuscripts discovered in ancient desert towns. It is possible that Tocharian was a vestige of the eastern spread of the Yamnaya. “We can just say that the expansion fits very well with the geographical spread of the Indo-European language,” said Dr. Willerslev. Paul Heggarty, a linguist at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology, said that the new studies were important, but were still too limited to settle the debate over the origins of Indo-European. “I don’t think we’re there yet,” he said. Dr. Heggarty noted that the studies showed the arrival of Yamnaya in Central Europe about 4,500 years ago. But Greek is an Indo-European language, and the oldest evidence of writing in Europe shows that Greek had developed about 3,500 years ago. By then, it was distinct from other Indo-European languages in Southern Europe, like Latin. If the Yamnaya were the source of Indo-European languages, they would have had to get to southern Europe soon after they made it to Central Europe. Dr. Heggarty speculated instead that early European farmers, the second wave of immigrants, may have brought Indo-European to Europe from the Near East. Then, thousands of years later, the Yamnaya brought the language again to Central Europe. More ancient DNA could swing the balance of evidence in favor of one theory over the other, Dr. Heggarty said. A stronger case for a steppe origin of Indo-European might emerge, for example, if scientists discovered that Greeks around 4,500 years ago abruptly acquired Yamnaya DNA. “Let’s see whether they look like the steppe people or not,” he said. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Scientists have found that today's Europeans descended from three groups who moved into Europe at different stages of history.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Mata has signed a five-year contract and is available for Saturday's game against Norwich. \\"Valencia was a big club anyway but I have left to join a bigger club,\\" the 23-year-old winger said. \\"It is all about the opportunity to win trophies and I have that here.\\" The Spaniard said Blues boss Andre Villas-Boas convinced him to move. \\"He said he wanted Chelsea this season to play more attacking football, and that I would be a big part of that,\\" added Mata. \\"Villas-Boas is someone who won almost everything last year [the former Porto boss won the Portuguese league, Europa League and two domestic cups last season] and we are both here with the idea of winning lots this season.\\" You can argue Mata brings something Chelsea have lacked since Arjen Robben left - a player with real acceleration who can put defenders on the back foot. I do not think it means an end to Chelsea's efforts to sign Luka Modric as, while Mata can play in the centre, I would be very surprised if he did for Chelsea. I would imagine he will play on the right with Florent Malouda on the left. He is creative and has two good feet, although he is predominantly left-footed. Mata is quite a modest and down-to-earth guy and can be a key player for Chelsea for years to come. Mata, who can play on the wing or centrally, revealed that he could have a versatile role in a Chelsea side that lacked width last season. \\"The plan is that I can play on either flank or even in the middle playing in between the lines of midfield and attack, he said. \\"I like to keep the ball and use it well, I am an attacking player and above all I like to set up goals and score them also. \\"I want to adapt as quickly as possible to my new surroundings, my colleagues and this league, and I would love to win a trophy in my first season. \\"If it can be the Premier League then great.\\" Chelsea and Valencia confirmed that a fee had been agreed on Sunday and while it has not been officially disclosed reports in Spain suggest the Blues are paying £23.5m. Mata has been at Valencia since 2007 and as captain helped Spain win the Under-21 European Championship in the summer. He was also part of Spain's 2010 World Cup winning squad. Mata joined Valencia from Real Madrid's youth team. Last season, the 23-year-old midfielder, who is 5ft 7in tall, scored eight goals to help Valencia to a third-place finish in the Primera Liga. He was also part of Spain's 2010 World Cup-winning squad.","completion":"A soccer player named Mata joined a team called Chelsea and he is very excited to play with them.

I read this background article the other day: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. I am facing a new situation today: Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)?

This is because Danny was diagnosed with hypercalcaemia, a condition where there is an excess of calcium in the blood. One of the possible causes for hypercalcaemia is excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), as it facilitates calcium absorption. On the other hand, Greg was diagnosed with hypocalcaemia, which is characterized by low calcium levels in the blood and can be caused by inadequate secretion of PTH or defective PTH receptors in cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to the extra charge for meat, she insisted we could not have pico AND sauce in our burritos without incurring another extra charge. I didn't even ask about adding corn or onions to my order because I'm not a millionaire, folks! Price aside, the burrito girl should really have worn a hairnet because I found a hair in one of my last bites. I wonder if there was an extra charge for it? I'd suggest the Subway next door for a cheaper, hassle free, quick breakfast if you're a fan of fixings and accoutrements. Choose the sentiment of this review?

However, his hold on Lan Na and Tenasserim coast was still nominal. The Siamese who originally were concerned about the rising power of Restored Hanthawaddy now actively supported the ethnic Mon rebels operating in the upper Tenasserim coast. In December 1759, Alaungpaya and his 40,000-strong armies invaded the Tenasserim coast. They crossed over the Tenasserim Hills, and finally reached Ayutthaya on 11 April 1760. But only five days into the siege, the Burmese king suddenly fell ill and the Burmese withdrew. The king died three weeks later, ending the war. The 1760 war was inconclusive. Although Burma had regained the upper Tenasserim coast to Tavoy, they still had to deal with Siamese supported rebellions in Lan Na and at Tavoy . The warfare resumed in August 1765, when two Burmese armies invaded again in a pincer movement on the Siamese capital. The Burmese armies took Ayutthaya in April 1767 after a 14-months' siege. The Burmese armies sacked the city and committed atrocities that mar the Burmese-Thai relations to the present. The Burmese were forced to withdraw a few months later due to the Chinese invasions of their homeland. Burma however had annexed the lower Tenasserim coast.

Perfect for frying, sautéing, and browning, a skillet can easily transform raw ingredients into mouth-watering dishes. In this guide, we walk you through the steps to create a simple yet flavorful base using garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and fresh flat parsley. Using a 10-inch (25.4cm) skillet, this base can enhance the taste of countless dishes, from pastas to meats and sautéed vegetables. Let's dive into the process of infusing these ingredients to create a savory powerhouse your taste buds will thank you for. Skillet Selection Before moving on to the recipe, it is essential to choose a suitable skillet. A 10-inch (25.4cm) skillet is the ideal choice for this particular base, as it provides ample space for even heating, ensuring optimal flavor combination of the ingredients. Whether you opt for a non-stick skillet or a classic cast-iron alternative, proper seasoning and care of the skillet are vital to guarantee a consistently delicious outcome. Preparing the Skillet for Cooking To start the process, place the 10-inch (25.4cm) skillet on your stove and set the burner to medium heat. Heating the skillet before adding any oil is important, as it allows it to reach an even temperature. This helps to avoid hot spots and uneven cooking. Giving the skillet time to preheat will ensure that its entire surface is ready for action when you start adding ingredients. Extra Virgin Olive Oil: The Healthy and Tasty Choice Once the skillet reaches medium heat, it's time to bring in the crucial base ingredient - extra virgin olive oil. This type of oil not only enhances the flavors of the recipe but is also a healthier option due to its high antioxidant content and heart-healthy fats. Drizzle a small amount of extra virgin olive oil to cover the surface of the skillet, ensuring the oil distributes evenly. Keep an eye on the oil's heat to ensure it doesn't smoke, as this would mean that the oil is becoming too hot, potentially creating an unfriendly environment for the other ingredients. Infusing Garlic for an Aromatic and Intense Flavor Here comes the next star ingredient: garlic. Using a whole crushed clove, introduce it to the hot oil to kick off the flavor infusion process. The heat will coax out the distinct aroma and flavors of the garlic, gently melding with the extra virgin olive oil. Make sure to continuously stir the garlic to prevent it from burning and maintain even heat throughout the process. Garlic is a flavorful and aromatic addition that will enhance the savoriness of your dish. Introducing Fresh Flat Parsley for a Vibrant and Fresh Twist Now that the garlic-infused oil is ready, it's time to add approximately 2 handfuls of fresh flat parsley to the skillet. This herb not only brings a beautiful green hue to the dish but is also packed with powerful nutrients and antioxidants. Stir the parsley in the hot oil and garlic mixture to evenly distribute the flavors. Fresh flat parsley provides a delightful herbaceous note that pairs harmoniously with the other components. Adjusting the Heat to Allow Flavors to Meld When all the ingredients are incorporated and filled the air with their delightful scents, lower the heat to a simmer or low setting. This allows the base to slowly infuse, marrying all the ingredients and ensuring the resulting sauce is smooth and consistent in texture. Let the mixture cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the garlic and parsley have reached the desired tenderness. Conclusion Once your garlic and parsley base is complete, you can use this for a multitude of dishes as a finishing sauce or as a cooking base. Think pasta, seafood, grilled meats, or a simple side dish of sautéed vegetables. The base created using this method is versatile, packed with flavor, and a great way to elevate the most straightforward recipes, making it an excellent tool to have in your culinary arsenal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Henley visa restrictions index is a global ranking of countries according to the travel freedom their citizens enjoy. This travel freedom is determined by the number of countries and territories that can be visited without applying for a visa or obtaining one on arrival. Countries with higher travel freedoms have passports that grant easier access to foreign destinations, reducing bureaucratic obstacles and making international travel more convenient for their citizens. Passports with better rankings typically belong to countries that maintain strong diplomatic relations, have a stable political situation, and possess a good track record in terms of security and adherence to international laws. These factors contribute to other nations granting visa-free or visa on arrival access to citizens of these countries. Consequently, countries with passports ranking higher on the Henley visa restrictions index enable their citizens to enjoy greater freedom in international travel, reflecting the global reputation and standing of their respective nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: In Mobile World, Tech Giants Scramble to Get Up to Speed Isaac Brekken for The New York Times Mandy Chan checks online prices with her phone while shopping at a Target in Las Vegas with her daughter Mia. SAN FRANCISCO — Intel made its fortune on the chips that power personal computers, and Microsoft on the software that goes inside. Google’s secret sauce is that it finds what you are looking for on the Internet. But the ground is shifting beneath these tech titans because of a major force: the rise of mobile devices. These and other tech companies are scrambling to reinvent their business models now that the old model — a stationary customer sitting at a stationary desk — no longer applies. These companies once disrupted traditional businesses, from selling books and music to booking hotels. Now they are being upended by the widespread adoption of smartphones and tablets. “Companies are having to retool their thinking, saying, ‘What is it that our customers are doing through the mobile channel that is quite distinct from what we are delivering them through our traditional Web channel?’ ” said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research, the technology research firm. He added, “It’s hilarious to talk about traditional Web business like it’s been going on for centuries, but it’s last century.” The industry giants remain highly profitable drivers of the economy. Yet the world’s shift to computing on mobile devices is taking a toll, including disappointing earnings reports last week from Google, Microsoft and Intel, in large measure related to revenue from mobile devices. Investors are in suspense over Facebook’s earnings to be disclosed Tuesday, for much the same reason. Yahoo’s new chief, Marissa Mayer, said on Monday that Yahoo had failed to capitalize on mobile and must become a predominantly mobile company. Demand for Intel chips inside computers — which are much more profitable than those inside smartphones — is plummeting. At Microsoft, sales of software for PCs are sharply declining. At Google, the price that advertisers pay when people click on ads has fallen for a year. This is partly because, while mobile ads are exploding, they cost less than Internet ads; advertisers are still figuring out how to make them most effective. Since its initial public offering, Facebook has lost half its value on Wall Street under pressure to make more money from mobile devices, now that six of 10 Facebook users log in on their phones. Making money will now depend on how deftly tech companies can track their users from their desktop computers to the phones in their palms and ultimately to the stores, cinemas and pizzerias where they spend their money. It will also depend on how consumers — and government regulators — will react to having every move monitored. Facebook is already experimenting with ways to use what it knows about its users to show ads when they are using other mobile apps. Google can link what a logged-in user does on the computer and phone, to show someone a cellphone ad based on what they have searched for on a computer at home, for instance. But just last week, European regulators warned Google to amend its privacy policy that allows it to gather information about people across diverse Google products, from Gmail to YouTube. In addition, Nielsen found that only one in five smartphone users described ads on phones as “acceptable.” Today almost half of Americans own a smartphone, according to comScore — an astoundingly fast adoption since Apple introduced the iPhone just five years ago. The amount of time people spend on their phones surfing the Web, using apps, playing games and listening to music has more than doubled in the last two years, to 82 minutes a day, according to eMarketer; the time spent online on computers will grow just 3.6 percent this year. “What has caught people off guard has been acceleration of the multitude of things that you can do with a smartphone,” said David B. Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor who studies the technology sector. “The Web started in 1993, ’94,” he added. “It didn’t disrupt everything for a decade and a half. The smartphone revolution started a half decade ago. Because of the existence of the Web, it allowed the phone to have a disruptive impact in a shorter time frame.” Still, mobile provides huge opportunities for these businesses, industry analysts say. That is largely because people reveal much more about themselves on phones than they do on computers, from where they go and when they sleep to whom they talk to and what they want to buy. Consumers may be put off by the intrusion of marketers into their daily lives, but companies say the trade-off can be worth it — an unprompted calendar alert, say, that tells you whether you’ll be late for a meeting or a coupon when you are near a shop. “We’re really starting to live in a new reality, one where the ubiquity of screens really helps users move from intent to action much faster and more seamlessly,” Larry Page, Google’s chief executive, told analysts last week. “It will create new opportunity in advertising.”","completion":"This news article talks about how technology giants like Intel, Microsoft, and Google are trying to adapt to the rise of mobile devices. People are now using smartphones and tablets more than desktop computers, and this change is causing companies to rethink how they do business. They need to find new ways to make money from mobile devices and adjust their thinking about how people use the internet. Mobile devices offer new opportunities for advertising, but some people don't like the idea of being tracked so closely by these companies. The success of these tech giants will depend on how well they can adapt to the mobile revolution."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Pakistan, itself a victim of terrorism, shares the anxiety of the international community, and has long been at the forefront of the campaign against this phenomenon. Pakistan, being a nation that has been heavily affected by acts of terrorism, empathizes with the concerns expressed by the global community. For a considerable period, Pakistan has been actively involved in leading the fight against the growing issue of terrorism. The country has witnessed firsthand the devastating implications of such acts on its citizens, its economy, and overall stability. To combat this challenge, Pakistan has taken several measures both on the domestic and international fronts. These measures include military operations, intelligence-driven operations, and policy reforms within the country to address the root causes of terrorism. Alongside this, the Pakistani government has established frameworks to counter extremist narratives by promoting education, economic development, and social cohesion. In conjunction with these domestic efforts, Pakistan has actively participated in international collaborations to fight terrorism on a global scale. The country has engaged in numerous dialogues and has cooperated with international organizations, like the United Nations, in order to strengthen its counter-terrorism strategies. They have also worked closely with their regional partners to foster improved law enforcement capacities and maintain information-sharing mechanisms. These cooperative and collaborative efforts have helped to dismantle various terrorist networks, resulting in a reduction in terrorist incidents. Nevertheless, the threat of terrorism still lingers both within Pakistan and on the international stage. Hence, the Government of Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to actively counter-terrorism and protect its citizens and the world community from its disastrous consequences. In conclusion, Pakistan's role in combating terrorism is one that has stemmed from the country's own suffering at the hands of terrorists.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If you spend the majority of your days doing things you don't enjoy or feel connected to in any way, then it's no wonder you're feeling down. Find time, either on the weekends or during work/school breaks, to do things you are passionate about. These activities should be active (though not necessarily physically), engaging activities. Passive activities like watching TV or surfing the web don't count. The key is to do something that occupies 100% of your attention and forces you to be in the present moment rather than letting your mind drift off to negative thoughts. If you don't have any enjoyable hobbies or interests, then find some. It could be an outdoor activity like golf, tennis, swimming, or hiking, an artistic activity like music, painting, or photography, or a philanthropic activity like volunteering at an animal shelter. Having tangible things to work toward will instantly make you feel more enthusiastic about life, and give your life a sense of purpose. Your goals can be personal, having to do with your career, education, or personal relationships, or they can be external, like striving to make a positive impact on your community. Set both short-term and long-term goals. For example, make a list of things you need to get done today, like finishing your homework, buying groceries, or walking the dog, and check each one off as you go. This will give you a sense of accomplishment and motivation to leave the house. If you are having trouble setting long-term goals because you don't know what you want to do with your life, then start by asking yourself what kind of legacy you want to leave behind. How do you want to be remembered by people once you are gone? What kind of impact do you want to make on the world? Whatever your long-term goal(s) are, be sure that they are things that you genuinely care about and want, not necessarily things that your parents or people around you are pressuring you to do. While you want your goals to be realistic, they shouldn't necessarily be easy. Easy goals won't push you past your comfort zone or make you feel accomplished or excited. Don't underestimate your own abilities by setting mediocre goals. If there are specific people or things in your life that are truly getting you down, then it's important to remove them as soon as possible. If your job is making you miserable, then quit. If you are in an unhappy or abusive relationship, then end it immediately. There will always be aspects of your life that annoy or irritate you, but that doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of all of them. The key is to determine whether the benefits of having the person or thing in your life outweigh the negative. For example, school or work may be exhausting, but the benefit of being educated and able to support yourself financially are worth the hard work you put in. Similarly, the support and unconditional love you receive from your family are a fair trade for the occasional fighting and bickering. No matter how wonderful your life becomes, it will always seem horrible if you have horrible thoughts. Our thoughts have the power to transform the world around us for either the better or the worse. Happy people aren't necessarily the ones with the best circumstances; they are the ones with the best attitudes. Learning to pay more attention to your thoughts is the first step toward becoming more positive. Notice when you are having excessively pessimistic or negative thoughts, and tell yourself \\"I'm being very negative right now.\\" Eventually, you will learn to become your own happiness coach by reminding yourself to stop approaching things from such a negative point of view. Having a sedentary lifestyle is not only detrimental to your physical health, putting you at greater risk for obesity and cancer, it also negatively effects your emotional health, causing you to feel lethargic, bored, and apathetic. You should get at least 30 minutes of physical activity everyday. This doesn't mean you have to join a gym or play an organized sport. Even the simple act of walking around the mall or park for an hour is enough to do the trick. It's especially important to conscious effort to get up and moving if you work a desk job or are a student and spend most of your time sitting at a desk studying. Buy a pedometer to track the number of steps you take in a day. If you are walking enough, then you don't necessarily need to have formal exercise every day. Make small lifestyle changes to fit more activity into your day. Park further away from your destination, take the stairs rather than the elevator, and do chores around the house. What is a summary?","completion":"Sure kiddo! So this is saying, to be happy, do things you love! Sitting and watching TV doesn't count, you should be doing something that makes you really focused and happy, like playing music or maybe painting pictures. You should have goals or things you want to achieve, to be excited about your life. Just like when you're excited to finish a puzzle or when you're looking forward to your birthday party. Sometimes, you might have things or people in your life that make you sad. If they are hurting you, it's okay to remove them from your life. Also, even if something is a bit hard, like school, it can be good because it helps you learn and grow. This also talks about how you see things. Even if things aren't perfect, if you have a happy mindset, you can still have a happy life. Lastly, it's saying being active and moving around is important, not just for your body but for your mood too. Just like how you feel good when you run and play outside, it's the same for grown-ups too. Don't just sit at a desk all day, walk around, take the stairs and get your body moving. It's like when mommy asks you to clean your room, it's also a way to move around! Does that help, buddy?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: President Barack Obama participates in an interview with Chris Wallace, anchor of \\"Fox News Sunday,\\" in the Blue Room of the White House on Sept. 9, 2013 The rousing rhetoric of a wartime speech is one thing. Trying to explain what the U.S. might do in Syria is quite another, a rhetorical puzzle that Obama’s administration has been trying to piece together for the war-weary American people. In six interviews last night, Obama walked a thin line trying to explain what, exactly, the U.S. should do when another country crosses a red line. Here are six rules the President and many of his aides seem to be following when it comes to talking about war that isn’t war. Don’t use the word “war,” of course. There has long been a stockpile of euphemisms for actions or threats that involve making war, in the dictionary sense of “the employment of armed forces against a foreign power”: any necessary means, regime change, ultimate defense, humanitarian intervention, grave consequences—all options being on the table. In his interviews last night, Obama repeatedly referred to “military action” and even euphemized “military action” as “a significant piece of business” in an interview with PBS. “Everybody knows if you send in Tomahawk missiles and you’ve got the fleet sitting off the coast, those are war-like actions,” says Ken Khachigian, a former speechwriter for Nixon and the chief speechwriter for Reagan. Still, he says, “I wouldn’t say ‘we’re going to war’.” Talk about what it is by saying what it isn’t. Whatever the U.S. does in Syria, Obama reiterated last night, will not involve “boots on the ground.” It will not include “sustained airstrikes.” It will not amount to being involved in the “entire Syrian conflict.” The “sectarian civil way in Syria” is one thing, and what the U.S. does is another. He said America will not “embroil” itself. It will not be “long term.” And it will not be “costly.” This military action will not amount to “a military engagement” or “some large-scale invasion,” that would morph into a “slippery slope.” And it certainly wouldn’t be anything like other slippery slopes America has been trying to climb in the Middle East, he said, or “even Libya.” Say the target is a group of things. Obama’s language suggested that the U.S., unlike Bashar Assad, would not really be taking action against human beings. A military strike in Syria is different than one in Iraq or Afghanistan, he implied, because this is a fight against the use of things. His plan is for the U.S. to strike “Assad’s capabilities,” to execute a “set of strikes to degrade his chemical weapons capabilities,” to “deal with this chemical weapons issue.” Our foes in his words are nouns that will never live or breath. “There’s a lot of clinical language that gets used when you’re speaking about the actions taken by your own side,” says former Clinton speechwriter Jeff Shesol. “Your language gets a little looser when you’re speaking about the other.” Secretary of State John Kerry likely went too far yesterday when he said that military action would be “unbelievably small.” As Shesol says, “It starts to sound at a certain point like protesting too much.” But Obama used keywords last night to suggest that, if war was a duel to the death, military action in Syria will be more of a glove to the face demanding satisfaction. He used the word limited no fewer than 10 times, and words like narrow. He repeatedly used the word proportional. What exactly is proportional to a foreign leader’s use of chemical weapons on his own citizens is up for debate, but proportional action implicitly rules out widespread destruction or anything that would be big enough, in theory, to justify another round of retaliation. The word Obama used last night most often in reference to chemical weapons and why most all of humanity opposes them was indiscriminate. So he emphasized that military action taken by the U.S. would be the opposite of blind slaughter. It would instead be discriminate and “very specific” in a “targeted,” even “surgical,” way. When Obama wasn’t referring to military “action,” he referred to military “strikes,” which also sound much more distinct than bombings or even the use of missiles. Weapons are chaotic; a strike is like an organized bolt of lightning. “They really want people to understand how contained this operation is going to be,” says Shesol. “[A limited strike] sounds very clean. It sounds very technical.” But make it sound serious. When NBC’s Savannah Guthrie interviewed Obama yesterday, she said the notion of “limited and consequential” strikes seemed almost a contradiction in terms. But if the U.S. is taking action, Obama has to make it sound like that action will be big and bad enough not only to deter Assad from using chemical weapons and to avenge the death of Syrian innocents, but to dissuade all other malefactors in the world from ever using chemical weapons again. So Obama repeatedly emphasized that military action would be “significant,” and that “the U.S. does not do pinpricks”—even if the U.S. does do small, surgical, limited, targeted strikes against weaponry and other things.

Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates.

Man's body was dismembered under home's crawl space according to previous owner.","completion":"Title: Dark Tales Unearthed: The Haunting History of The First Murder by Notorious Serial Killer Jeffrey Dahmer Introduction: In the sinister world of true crime, the name Jeffrey Dahmer stands out as one of the most chilling and infamous serial killers in American history. From 1978 to 1991, Dahmer brutally raped, murdered, and dismembered at least 17 young men, garnering the nickname \\"The Milwaukee Monster.\\" In this article, we delve into the diabolical start of Dahlmer's murderous rampage, examining the gruesome details behind his first known murder in 1978, where he lured his innocent 19-year-old victim to a seemingly ordinary house, leading to a macabre fate. Step 1: Exploring the events that led to the murder In June 1978, Jeffrey Dahmer graduated from high school and was preparing to begin a new chapter of his life. However, hidden beneath the façade of a young and ordinary man, lay a cold and calculating killer. Dahmer later admitted to fantasizing about murder since the age of 14, and on that fateful day, he picked up his unsuspecting victim from the local mall. Step 2: Revealing the victim's tragic fate The 19-year-old victim, unaware of the horror that awaited him, agreed to follow Dahmer to the house, which reportedly belonged to Dahmer's grandmother. Little did the young man know that it would be the last journey in his short and tragic life. Step 3: Detailing the gruesome murder method Once inside the house, Dahmer led the man to a back room where he carried out his sadistic fantasies. He used a barbell, a piece of exercise equipment, to bludgeon the young man to death. It's believed that Dahmer likely incapacitated his victim by striking him in the head and proceeded to strangle him. After confirming that the victim was dead, Dahmer continued to mutilate the lifeless body. Step 4: Uncovering the shocking disposal of the victim's body According to the house's previous owner, Dahmer dismembered the man's body beneath the home's crawl space. This barbaric act marked the beginning of Dahmer's gruesome signature of dismembering his victims, which would continue throughout his vile killing spree. Step 5: Discussing the impact of Dahmer's first murder Dahmer's twisted exploits came to light over a decade later when he was finally arrested in 1991. He would later confess to his many horrific crimes, including the chilling details of his first murder in 1978. The discovery left the nation shaken and further cemented Dahmer's infamy. This ghastly first act showed the extent of Dahmer's depravity and foreshadowed the monstrous acts that would follow, as he hunted for more innocent victims to prey on. Conclusion: The grim tale of Jeffrey Dahmer's first murder serves as a stark reminder of the darkness that can lurk within seemingly ordinary individuals. The heart-wrenching story of the 19-year-old victim has left an indelible mark on our collective memory, as we strive to comprehend the incomprehensible brutality and disturbing nature at the core of such heinous acts. As we explore these macabre details, we remember the victims, and seek to better understand the horrors that unfolded within that unassuming house in 1978 – where the Milwaukee Monster claimed his first life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer appears to be a loyal fan of Guns N'Roses, reiterating their excitement about their performance quality, which indicates a favorable opinion about the band. Although they comment on the poor lighting, this element seems to pertain more to the production or recording elements of the video rather than the band's performance itself. Furthermore, the use of the term 'pretty good' to evaluate the performance suggests this fan had an overall positive experience watching the video. Therefore, the review doesn't condemn or degrade the band or their performance, which one would expect from a negative review. Instead, the reviewer attributes any negative aspect to external factors like lighting, separately from the band's talent, skill, and performance.

Show her you are committed by spending quality time with her and paying attention to her when you are out socially or with a group. Part of being committed to your girlfriend is also trusting her and not being too protective or overbearing. Try not to control her life or her decisions. Instead of policing her actions or trying to control her, support and trust her. Deepen your relationship by pursuing activities or interests that you have in common. Focus on things that you both share and enjoy. For example, if you both enjoy travelling, plan a trip together overseas. If you both like to watch movies at home, designate one night movie night and watch all of your favorite flicks together. If you and your girlfriend share a home, make sure you pull your weight. Split the household chores with her, such as taking out the garbage or cleaning the kitchen. Try to keep your contributions to maintaining your home equal and fair. If you both have issues around household responsibilities, make sure you talk about it honestly and openly. Work through the issues together and find a compromise where you both are happy. Keep your relationship spontaneous and exciting by planning surprise dates or leaving special gifts for her to find. Let your girlfriend know you appreciate her by surprising her on occasion. You may surprise her with something simple, like a bouquet of flowers or a small gift. Or you may surprise her by taking her out for dinner or to do an activity that you know she would enjoy. Be open to your girlfriend surprising you with special dates or gifts, as well! Pay attention when she is generous and giving to you, so you can also feel appreciated and loved. Always thank her.","completion":"Being a good boyfriend involves staying committed, spending quality time, trusting and supporting your girlfriend, sharing common interests, equally contributing to household chores, and keeping the relationship exciting through surprises and appreciation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A more detailed and relevant response should include the following information: The Agreement on the Establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States was signed on December 8, 1991. This important event took place in the city of Belavezha, in the Byelorussian SSR, now known as Belarus. Representatives from three republics of the then Soviet Union - Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus - gathered to sign the Belavezha Accords. This group was led by Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia, Leonid Kravchuk, President of Ukraine, and Stanislav Shushkevich, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus. The signing of the agreement marked a historic moment, as it effectively marked the end of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the formation of the CIS. According to the agreement, the Soviet Union was declared extinct, and the newly-independent states agreed to collaborate on various issues such as economic, political, and humanitarian affairs. Later, eight more former Soviet republics joined the Commonwealth of Independent States: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The CIS was established as a mechanism for maintaining a sense of political, economic, and institutional unity among these newly-independent countries, particularly to manage the dissolution of the Soviet Union and coordinate their transition to independent states. It also fostered the negotiation of numerous bilateral and multilateral treaties among the participating states. The CIS is a model of regional cooperation based on mutual recognition and respect for state sovereignty. In conclusion, the Agreement on the Establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States was signed on December 8, 1991, in Belavezha, marking the end of the Soviet Union and the beginning of a new era of relations among the newly-independent states. The CIS was designed to allow its member states to collaboratively address various political, economic, and humanitarian issues and to uphold the principles of democracy and mutual respect for state sovereignty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a correct answer to the following question about Mexican War of Independence. Yes or no? Answer: The Mexican War of Independence (1810–1821) was an armed conflict between the people of Mexico and the Spanish colonial authorities which started on September 16, 1810. Question: when was mexican independence won Answer:","completion":"Yes, the Mexican War of Independence was a significant event that took place between 1810 and 1821, ultimately leading to Mexico's independence from Spanish rule. The conflict began on September 16, 1810, when Miguel Hidalgo, a Roman Catholic priest, issued the Grito de Dolores, calling for an uprising against Spanish colonial authorities. This marked the start of a long and bloody war, as Mexicans from all walks of life joined together in the fight for freedom and self-governance. The war took place in several phases, with various leaders and factions taking charge of the revolutionary movement. One of the critical moments in the struggle for independence was when José María Morelos, another priest and a prominent leader in the war, declared Mexico's independence on November 6, 1813, in the Congress of Chilpancingo. However, the war continued as the Spanish authorities did not recognize the declaration and engaged in numerous counterattacks against the revolutionaries. In 1820, political turmoil in Spain due to a liberal revolution weakened the Spanish monarchy, providing a valuable opportunity for the Mexican independence movement. By this time, several royalist commanders had begun to change their stance and celebrate Mexican nationalism. The most notable of these commanders was Agustín de Iturbide, who had fought against the independence movement but eventually became an advocate for Mexican autonomy. Recognizing the changing tides, Iturbide collaborated with the revolutionary leader, Vicente Guerrero, to develop the Plan of Iguala, which outlined the goals for establishing a sovereign Mexican state. The plan called for three essential principles: the establishment of a Mexican Empire with a constitutional monarchy, the Roman Catholic Church as the nation's only religion, and the equal treatment of Spanish and American-born citizens. On February 24, 1821, the Plan of Iguala was proclaimed, and the Army of the Three Guarantees, composed of both independence and royalist factions, was formed. The combined forces marched toward Mexico City, gaining support and momentum along the way, ultimately leading to the collapse of the Spanish colonial government. On August 24, 1821, representatives from the Spanish government and the Mexican independence movement, led by Iturbide, signed the Treaty of Córdoba. This document recognized the independence of Mexico and the establishment of the First Mexican Empire, making the Plan of Iguala its basis for governance. On September 27, 1821, the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City, marking the official end of the Mexican War of Independence. The first emperor of Mexico, Agustín de Iturbide, took the oath of office on September 28, and on October 4, Viceroy Juan O'Donojú, the last Spanish official in Mexico, left the country. In conclusion, the Mexican War of Independence was won on September 27, 1821, when the Army of the Three Guarantees, consisting of former revolutionaries and royalist forces, triumphantly entered Mexico City. Their entrance symbolized the victory and the culmination of an 11-year struggle for Mexican independence from Spanish rule."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - Cells obtain glucose and oxygen - The glucose and oxygen create carbon dioxide - The cells release energy - The cells don't have enough oxygen to repeat this - The cells obtain more oxygen from the air - The cells repeat this process. Question: suppose not enough carbon dioxide is produced happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If not enough carbon dioxide is produced in the cells, it can have a significant impact on the overall process and the supply of oxygen in the body. To understand this, let's break down the process and analyze the consequences of this perturbation. Under normal conditions, cells obtain glucose and oxygen, two essential nutrients required for generating energy. The cells utilize these resources through a process called cellular respiration. Oxygen plays a crucial role in this process as it helps break down glucose, ultimately resulting in the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) as byproducts. This process also leads to the release of chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides fuel for cellular activities. Now, suppose not enough carbon dioxide is produced during cellular respiration. This hypothetical situation can occur if the cells are not utilizing the provided oxygen efficiently. This could be due to a decrease in the amount of glucose available for energy production or a malfunction in the cellular machinery responsible for carrying out the process. This lack of CO2 production can disrupt the balance of gases in the blood, impacting the body’s ability to deliver oxygen effectively. Oxygen is transported to the cells via hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin binds to both oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules, but it releases the bound oxygen molecules when it encounters tissues with high carbon dioxide concentrations. The presence of high levels of CO2 signals that the cells need more oxygen for energy production. When there is less carbon dioxide being produced, this signaling mechanism is disrupted. The reduced levels of CO2 can result in the blood vessels constricting, causing less oxygen to reach the body's tissues. This can lead to a decreased oxygen supply, creating a state known as hypoxia. Furthermore, the lack of CO2 production can hinder the body's ability to detect when it requires more oxygen. The chemoreceptors in the respiratory system monitor blood CO2 levels, and when these levels rise, they send signals to increase the ventilation rate, enabling the body to intake more oxygen. However, when the CO2 levels are low, the breathing rate may not increase as needed, and the body may not receive an adequate supply of oxygen. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of not enough CO2 being produced can lead to less oxygen reaching the body. The disrupted balance of gases in the blood, coupled with the impaired sensing mechanisms, can contribute to reduced oxygen availability for cellular processes, ultimately affecting the overall functioning of the body's systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(1) Negative growth is often accompanied by a negative output gap in an economy ( where actual output exceeds potential demand ) . (2) Negative growth is often accompanied by a negative output gap in an economy ( where potential output exceeds actual demand ) . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing. They describe different situations in an economy, and the primary difference between them lies in the relationship between actual output and potential output/demand. Let's examine each sentence to understand the distinction. 1) \\"Negative growth is often accompanied by a negative output gap in an economy (where actual output exceeds potential demand).\\" In this sentence, negative growth refers to a situation where the economy is shrinking or contracting, as opposed to growing. When discussing a negative output gap, it indicates that the actual output (production) in the economy is less than potential output (the level of output that could have been produced if all resources were efficiently utilized). However, the explanation provided in parentheses seems to contradict the definition of a negative output gap, as it states that actual output exceeds potential demand. The concept of potential demand is not typically used to describe an output gap. It is likely a confusion between potential output and potential demand. That being said, if actual output exceeds potential demand, it would imply that the economy is overproducing in comparison to the level of demand in the market. As a result, excess supply can lead to decreases in production, a drop in prices, and economic contraction. 2) \\"Negative growth is often accompanied by a negative output gap in an economy (where potential output exceeds actual demand).\\" In this sentence, the explanation provided in parentheses aligns with the definition of a negative output gap. Negative growth is again referring to a situation where the economy is contracting. The statement that potential output exceeds actual demand means that the economy is not producing at its full potential, possibly due to lack of demand for goods and services or other factors restricting the efficient utilization of resources. As a result, the actual output is lower than what it could be if demand were higher and resources were efficiently used. In summary, the first sentence incorrectly describes a negative output gap (possibly due to a confusion between potential output and potential demand), while the second sentence accurately describes the relationship between negative growth and a negative output gap in an economy."},{"prompt":"In this task, you're given five sentences, numbered 1 through 5, and two options a and b for possible titles for the story.

Keshawn Perkins, a ninth-grade student, was denied bond Sunday. He was charged as an adult with one count each of first-degree murder and armed robbery in the death of Hester Scott, 55, who had been a police officer for 25 years. Scott's body was found Friday in a sewer trap behind her home on Chicago's South Side. The Cook County medical examiner's office said an autopsy Saturday showed Scott died of trauma in an assault and her death was ruled a homicide. Scott had adopted Perkins and he lived with her, prosecutors said. The teen was represented by a public defender in court Sunday and made no comments in open court. The Cook County public defender's office was closed Sunday and was not accepting phone calls. Prosecutors allege that Perkins had skipped school and was sleeping when his grandmother caught him. They said in court that the teen grabbed a nearby lamp and struck the woman with it \\"until she shut up.\\" The teen also is accused of stabbing his grandmother with a kitchen knife, taking her purse, wrapping her body in a blanket and dumping it in the backyard.

Membership of Rajya Sabha is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of 250 members, and current laws have provision for 245 members. Most of the members of the House are indirectly elected by state and territorial legislatures using single transferable votes, while the President can appoint 12 members for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members sit for staggered six-year terms, with one third of the members retiring every two years. - A nautical mile is a unit of measurement defined as exactly 1852 meters (about 6,076.1 feet or 1.1508 statute miles). Historically, it was defined as one minute of latitude, which is equivalent to one sixtieth of a degree of latitude. Today it is an SI derived unit, being rounded to an even number of meters and remains in use for both air and marine navigation and for the definition of territorial waters. - The Lok Sabha (House of the People) is the Lower house of India's bicameral Parliament, with the Upper house being the Rajya Sabha. Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by adult universal suffrage and a first-past-the-post system to represent their respective constituencies, and they hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers.

OPT: 1. no; 2. yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Question 1: Why is karma called a bitch? The famous saying \\"Karma is a bitch\\" is derived from the popular idea of karma, which, in many Eastern religions and philosophies, is the concept that one’s actions—positive or negative—determine the future consequences they will face in their life or a subsequent one. People often use this phrase to explain that when someone experiences negativity or hardships as a result of their ill-intentioned deeds, they are facing the negative consequences of their previous actions. The phrase may seem inappropriate or harsh to some individuals, but it metaphorically employs the term \\"bitch\\" to illustrate the idea that karma can impart tough and unexpected consequences on those who act unjustly. By using a term conveying a harsh reality, the phrase reinforces the severity of the karmic consequences. Question 2: Is Karma a bitch? The answer to whether karma is a \\"bitch\\" is subjective and depends on an individual's perspective. For those who believe in the concept of karma and its potentially harsh consequences, the phrase may ring true. They might perceive that someone receiving negativity after engaging in destructive actions is due to life's natural cycles and is fully deserved. On the other hand, individuals who might not adhere to karma-based philosophies or who believe the term is disrespectful might interpret the notion differently. They could perceive the universe or life as more nuanced and not operating on such a strict cause-and-effect dynamic. For them, life comprises various influencing factors, which do not always result in direct or proportional consequences. Alternatively, they might simply take issue with the perceived crudeness of the phrase. OPT 1: No; 2: Yes; Since the answers to these two questions are contingent upon personal beliefs and interpretations, it is not possible to generalize and provide a single applicable response to both questions. The first question explores the reason behind the expression, while the second question asks whether the statement is accurate or not.

The council had planned to centralise Welsh-medium education for mid and south Powys in Builth Wells High School, which is a 40 mile (64km) round trip.

Movie title: Testament Movie plot: The Wetherly familyâhusband Tom (William Devane), wife Carol (Jane Alexander), and children Brad (Ross Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas) -- live in the fictional suburb of Hamelin, California, within a 90-minute drive of San Francisco, where Tom works. On a routine afternoon, Carol (a stay-at-home mom and volunteer for school functions such as directing the school play) listens to an answering-machine message from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it. Suddenly, the blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is then seen through the window. The family huddles on the floor in panic as the town's air-raid sirens go off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are running around on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family hopes Tom will return, but the circumstances are hard to ignore. The suburb of Hamelin survives relatively unscathed, because apparently the town is far enough from San Francisco to avoid blast damage.

A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Testament,\\" the Wetherly family hopes that their husband and father, Tom (William Devane), will return. The story revolves around the family's life in a fictional California suburb called Hamelin and their struggle to survive after a nuclear attack has wiped out much of the country. The movie begins with a normal day in the Wetherly household. Tom works in San Francisco, while his wife, Carol (Jane Alexander), stays at home and takes care of their children, Brad (Ross Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas). On that fateful day, Carol receives a message from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. However, this routine is interrupted by news of nuclear explosions in New York and across the East Coast. In a matter of moments, a blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is seen from their home, and the family is thrown into a panic. Despite the devastation and chaos that ensues, the Wetherly family and their neighbors in Hamelin manage to survive the initial impact relatively unscathed, as their town is far enough from San Francisco to avoid the worst of the blast damage. However, with communication systems down and uncertainty about what has happened, the family is understandably desperate for the return of Tom, who was working in the city at the time of the attack and has not been heard from since. As the film unfolds, the family and their community must grapple with the grim reality of living in a post-apocalyptic world where resources are scarce, and hope is in short supply. The people of Hamelin come together at the home of Henry Abhart (Leon Ames), an elderly ham radio operator who has made contact with survivors in rural areas and internationally. Although he manages to relay some information to the group, he is unable to reach anyone east of Keokuk, Iowa, painting a bleak picture of the situation. As they come to grips with the destruction and loss that has occurred, the Wetherly family remains hopeful for Tom's return. However, the film does not provide easy answers or a clear resolution, instead focusing on the resilience and strength required for the family and their community to continue living amidst the turmoil and uncertainty.

The first reinforcement to the Teutonic forces arrived in early 1261, but was wiped out on January 21, 1261 by Herkus Monte in the Battle of Pokarwis. In January 1262 reinforcements arrived from the Rhineland, led by Wilhelm VII, Duke of Jülich, who was obliged by Pope Alexander IV to fulfil his crusader duties in Prussia. This army broke the Siege of Königsberg but as soon as the army returned home, the Sambians resumed the siege and were reinforced by Herkus Monte and his Natangians. Herkus was later injured and the Natangians retreated, leaving the Sambians unable to stop supplies reaching the castle and the siege eventually failed. Prussians were more successful capturing castles deeper into the Prussian territory , and the Knights were left only with strongholds in Balga, Elbing, Culm, Thorn, and Königsberg. Most castles fell in 1262-1263, and Bartenstein fell in 1264. The Prussians destroyed captured forts instead of using them for their own defence, so the end of successful sieges meant that large Prussian forces did not have to stay near their home and were then free to operate in other parts of Prussia, raiding the Culmerland and Kuyavia. A recovered Herkus Monte raided Culmerland with a large force and took many prisoners in 1263. On his way back to Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies. In the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal. The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm in 1263 and in 1265.

Answer this question: who won the battle of bentonville civil war??","completion":"The Battle of Bentonville, a pivotal engagement of the American Civil War, took place from March 19 to 21, 1865, near Bentonville, North Carolina. The Union Army, led by Major General William T. Sherman, emerged victorious against the Confederate Army commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston. The battle was part of Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, which aimed to bring the war to an end by destroying the remaining Confederate forces' resistance in the South. Bentonville was the last major battle that General Johnston fought with his forces before his ultimate surrender on April 26th, 1865, at Bennett Place, North Carolina. Sherman's Union force, which primarily consisted of the Army of the Tennessee and the Army of Georgia, was on a northward march after the capture of Savannah, Georgia, in December 1864. Approaching Goldsboro, North Carolina, Sherman's forces were divided into two wings. General Johnston saw an opportunity to launch an offensive against the Union forces and assembled a collection of Confederate troops, including troops from the Army of Tennessee and several smaller divisions. This loose-knit force is also known as the \\"Army of the South.\\" Johnston's main objective was to slow down or, even better, halt Sherman's advance. On March 19, Johnston launched a surprise attack against the left wing of Sherman's army, led by Major General Henry W. Slocum. Initial success gave the Confederates a boost in morale, but Union reinforcements soon arrived, and the tide shifted in favor of the Union forces. Over the next two days, the battle consisted of sporadic skirmishes, with the Union forces gradually pushing against the Confederate lines. On March 21, Sherman’s right wing, under Major General Oliver O. Howard’s command, joined the battlefield, further reinforcing the Union advantage. Realizing the futility of fighting against an increasingly dominant opponent, General Johnston ordered a retreat on the night of March 21, thereby marking the end of the battle. The Union forces sustained around 1,527 casualties, including killed, wounded, and missing soldiers, while the Confederate forces lost approximately 2,606 soldiers due to killed, wounded, captured, or missing in action. The outcome of the Battle of Bentonville further weakened the Confederacy in the closing months of the American Civil War. Sherman's victory and continued march through the South – and the exhaustion of the Confederates' resources – contributed to the eventual end of the war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Soviet propaganda and representatives went to great lengths to minimize the importance of the fact that they had opposed and fought against the Nazis in various ways for a decade prior to signing the Pact. Upon signing the pact, Molotov tried to reassure the Germans of his good intentions by commenting to journalists that \\"fascism is a matter of taste\\". For its part, Nazi Germany also did a public volte-face regarding its virulent opposition to the Soviet Union, though Hitler still viewed an attack on the Soviet Union as \\"inevitable\\".[citation needed] If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): A war with the USSR wasn't considered certain according to whom?","completion":"A war with the USSR wasn't considered certain according to some politicians, diplomats, and military officials who were not privy to Adolf Hitler's long-term plan of invading the Soviet Union, as detailed in his book Mein Kampf. Although the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact created an illusion of peace and cooperation between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Hitler always harbored the intention of eventually attacking and conquering the USSR. This intention was later manifested in the launch of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941. There were pragmatists on both sides who hoped that the Pact could lead to a lasting truce, or at least delay the hostilities between the two powers for a significant amount of time. Molotov and Ribbentrop, the foreign ministers of the USSR and Nazi Germany respectively, may have been among those who believed the Pact could maintain relative peace between the countries, even though they were conscious of the ideological differences and mutual distrust. Additionally, other countries observing the situation, such as the United States and members of the League of Nations, may have had divergent views on the certainty of a war between Nazi Germany and the USSR, ranging from cautious optimism to outright skepticism. It is important to note that, within the context of the volatile political climate of the late 1930s, anything short of a formal alliance could not be taken as an assurance of lasting peace. The eventual invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany in 1941 demonstrated that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was ultimately a strategic move for both countries to buy time and consolidate their power before the inevitable conflict, rather than a genuine attempt at diplomacy and cooperation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: Like simple hormone pathways, hormone cascade pathways typically involve what kind of feedback? Choices: - effective - positive - neutral - negative A: Answer:","completion":"Hormone cascade pathways typically involve negative feedback. In the context of hormonal regulation, negative feedback is a mechanism that helps maintain homeostasis within the body. It happens when the Output or the level of a hormone in the system signals to inhibit further secretion or production of that hormone. This ensures that the hormone levels in the body do not get too high or too low, allowing the body to function optimally. To provide a clearer picture of how hormone cascade pathways work, let's take a look at an example: the regulation of thyroid hormone levels in the body. 1. The hypothalamus, a part of the brain that serves as the primary control center for the endocrine system, detects low levels of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream. 2. The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in response to these low levels. 3. TRH then signals the pituitary gland, another part of the brain that regulates hormone levels, to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). 4. TSH travels through the bloodstream to reach the thyroid gland, where it stimulates the production and release of thyroid hormones like thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). 5. As the levels of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland sense this increase and reduce the secretion of TRH and TSH, respectively. Consequently, thyroid hormone production also decreases, maintaining a balanced level of hormones in the body. This example demonstrates how hormone cascade pathways typically involve negative feedback to maintain homeostasis. By sensing and responding to the changes in hormone levels, the body can efficiently self-regulate and maintain optimal health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Summarize this article: Developing your mixed voice is a complex task that is one of the most complicated vocal techniques in singing. Many classically-trained voice teachers cannot do it! If you're determined to learn how to do it, find a vocal coach with experience in this area to guide you. Chromatic scales are composed of notes in sequence, like the keys of a piano. Start with a scale a few notes below the break point in your register—the moment you normally switch from chest voice to head voice. Sing 5-note chromatic scales above, through, and below the break, in ascending and descending patterns. Keep your tone even, and go slowly. Don't rush the difficult notes. You will naturally blend your head and chest voices if you sing below and above your register break without changing your tone. Play along on a piano as you sing, or sing along to a recording of vocal exercises. You can easily find free recordings of 5-note chromatic scales for vocal exercise online. While warming up, sing short scales. Rather than singing each note distinctly, \\"slide\\" your voice from one note to the next. Sing up and down a scale. Go slowly and do not allow yourself to vary your speed, so that you don't skip over your register break. Yawn widely to stretch your lips. Purse your lips and say \\"buh-buh-buh\\" while singing a scale. Try to make a good clear noise, not releasing too much air. If your lips keep losing the trill, stop and yawn, or put a finger in each cheek on either side of your mouth. Use this exercise regularly. The beginning of your routine is a good time for it, as it warms up your mouth. Do your trills for a scale longer each time. When singing using your chest voice, focus on not straining your throat.","completion":"The article discusses the development of mixed voice, a complex and advanced vocal technique in singing that combines the chest and head voices.

To begin, one should start with a scale a few notes below their register break point, where they typically switch between chest and head voices. Singing 5-note chromatic scales above, through, and below the break in ascending and descending patterns helps to keep the tone even and consistent.

To further warm up the mouth and improve the exercise, one should yawn widely to stretch their lips and practice a \\"buh-buh-buh\\" sound while singing a scale with pursed lips. To maintain a clear noise without releasing too much air, one can stop and yawn or place a finger in each cheek if needed. This exercise is particularly useful at the beginning of a routine, and extending the trills for a scale over time is encouraged.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Coronation Street spoilers: Gail Platt will NEVER marry again after latest husband Michael Rodwell killed by evil builder Phelan She's been married six times and had more surnames than most people have had hot dinners, but now Weatherfield's own Elizabeth Taylor is done with husbands CORONATION Street’s Gail Platt will NEVER marry again, actress Helen Worth has revealed. The actress – who has played wedding frock addict Gail Potter Tilsley Tilsley Platt Hillman McIntyre Rodwell since 1974 – has been married six times so far and been incredibly unlucky in love, but now with her latest husband being killed off, she’s done with the whole concept. “Another husband,” she said to The Sun Online ahead of actor Les Dennis’ exit, after the many deaths of her previous on-screen husbands. “I’m afraid I’m losing count, I’m not sure we’re going to be able to cast anyone else as I’m not sure anyone will take the job.” The star also revealed how instead of trying to find another husband, Gail will focus on her children and live through them. “I think Gail will just look after her boys, just live through them,” she added. Viewers were left devastated at last night’s Corrie as Michael suffered a fatal heart-attack right in front of the evil scammer, who appeared to take glee in watching Michael gasp for breath in front of him. He growled: “It just so happens your time’s up,” after recalling a horrific story about shooting a rabbit as a child and watching it slowly die. Phelan then walked off, leaving Michael to die alone on the cold muddy ground of a building site. Michael has been digging into the scheming character, and is convinced Phelan and Vinny’s property development is bogus after hearing them discussing Mexico over the phone – and he discovered he was right moments before he died. Gail first married Brian Tilsley in 1979 and then again in 1988 Michael’s sad end was made all the more horrible as Gary – dating his stepdaughter Sarah Louise – arrived suddenly and failed to help. Earlier this week, Les gave some hints about Michael’s demise. He said: “Phelan had met his match in Michael and we will see what happens. Coronation Street has been the most wonderful show to be part of. “To play a character I hope will have made an impact has been great. The Platts are a dynasty and I’ve had the best time.” Fans weren’t happy to see the back of Les’ character, who has become a firm favourite with viewers. One made a cheeky reference to his previous gig hosting Family Fortunes, including three crosses in his tweet. He wrote: “Our survey said: XXX RIP Michael.” Others were aghast that Phelan left him to die in the street. It means that Gail is a widow for the umpteenth time after she made Michael her fourth husband after she caught him trying to burgle her home.

The sentiment towards the art class largely depends on the context provided by the rest of the tweet. 3. \\"will be boring\\": The user explicitly states their expectation that the art class will be uninteresting or dull. This is a clear indication of a negative sentiment towards the upcoming class. 4. \\"wish I was in the other art class\\": This statement implies that the user prefers another art class and has a more positive view of it in comparison to the one they are currently enrolled in. The longing to be in a different and presumably better art class also reinforces the negative feeling towards their current art class.

Given the question: I can use this background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Now, I have a new situation: The Farlook forest is classified as a tropical forest, and the Celeste forest is not a tropical forest. Jessica is currently looking for a forest to go camping in and is trying to choose which of these two forests she will visit for a week. Jessica despises camping in the rain and also prefers a more moderate temperature. Luckily, her trip isn't for several months so she has plenty of time to make up her mind. Answer this question please: Which forest's soil will be colored red? The answer is:","completion":"The Farlook forest's soil will be colored red. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The given background mentions that tropical forests have little to no podzolization, and their mobile metals (Mg, Fe, and Al) are precipitated as oxide minerals, giving the soil a rusty red color. 2. The new situation specifies that the Farlook forest is classified as a tropical forest, while the Celeste forest is not a tropical forest. 3. Based on the given background information about tropical forests, we can deduce that the Farlook forest (being a tropical forest) will have soil with a rusty red color, due to the mobile metals precipitating as oxide minerals. 4. Since the Celeste forest is not a tropical forest, it does not meet the criteria for having red-colored soil as described in the given background information. Therefore, the Farlook forest's soil will be colored red."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Input: By Jon DouglasReporter, You & Yours Victims have told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours that their accounts have been emptied without them getting a single call or text from the bank. It is the latest issue to have emerged following TSB's problematic switchover to a new computer platform. TSB say their fraud detection systems are monitoring people's accounts. Annette, from East Sussex, had more than £3,500 stolen from her internet bank account. TSB wrote to her apologising for not contacting her about changes that had been made to her telephone number and password as the fraud was carried out. The letter also acknowledged that multiple, unusual transfers of money out of her account had not been spotted, saying: \\"We have in place sophisticated systems which are designed to spot fraudulent activity, however these transactions were not flagged by the system. \\"We are unable to explain why, but please be assured that we continually update and improve our systems to improve their detection rates\\". 'Let down' again TSB refunded all her money and credited her bank account with an additional £100. But that money - and everything else in her bank account - also seems to have been stolen. Annette told You and Yours that even though her log-in details and password had been changed she had been affected by another fraud on her bank account. She said she was \\"furious\\" with TSB. \\"They've let me down again. I've told them 'you can't keep my money safe and I've no choice but to leave'.\\" Annette says that she did not receive any fraud alert from TSB when her account was emptied for a second time. Other customers are making similar complaints. One man from Perth said he did not hear from the bank when someone moved about £13,000 from his three TSB accounts then set up multiple payments to transfer everything out. The migration of data on TSB's five million customers from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by current Spanish owner Sabadell created major difficulties for the bank. Ahead of that move, the bank's chief executive was quoted as saying the new system would make it \\"so much easier for us to pick up on fraudulent transactions\\". Some customers have reported getting fraud notifications from the bank but have then struggled to get any more information. 'Terribly worrying' Susan, from Edinburgh, went into her local TSB branch for help after failing to get through to the fraud team on the telephone. She had been contacted by TSB after unusual activity had been spotted on her account. She had been promised a call back but had heard nothing more. Susan says branch staff tried for three hours, but even they could not get an answer from the fraud department. \\"I am panicked and appalled because I am left with zero in my bank account. To all intents and purposes I'm destitute and no one is making an attempt to let me know what is happening,\\" she said. \\"It is terribly worrying. I've not slept. I have been tearful. I have spent hours by the telephone. There's fraud - I would have expected if not an immediate response then certainly within maybe an hour or so. It is people's life savings here and I don't even know if I am going to get my money back\\". Following the move to their new computer system, TSB warned that criminals were specifically targeting their customers with phishing emails and texts. TSB said no one would be left out of pocket but refused to say if there had been a surge in fraud on customers' accounts or if their computer problems had affected their ability to alert customers to fraudulent transactions. \\"Protecting our customers' money is our number one priority and we have a multi-layered anti-fraud framework in place to make sure they don't become a victim of fraud,\\" a spokesman said. \\"Our fraud detection systems are monitoring customers' accounts and we're on the lookout for suspicious activity.\\" You can hear more on this story on the You and Yours programme website.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less iron dissolved happens, how will it affect LESS rust forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if less iron dissolves during the process, it would lead to the formation of less rust. To analyze the effects of this hypothesis on the rusting process, let us break down each step and understand the direct and indirect impacts. 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron: In this scenario, if less iron were to dissolve, the surface area of contact between the iron and water might be reduced. However, this step remains unaffected by the perturbation. The reduction in dissolved iron could be a result of various factors such as the type and quality of iron or the presence of a protective coating or barrier. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid: This process also remains unaffected by the hypothesis, as it primarily involves the formation of carbonic acid through the reaction between water and carbon dioxide. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve: Perturbation hypothesis posits that less iron would dissolve during this step. This could be due to several reasons, including a slower rate of dissolution, partial obstruction by protective barriers or coatings, or the presence of impurities preventing a complete reaction. 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen: This step is independent of the amount of dissolved iron and won't be impacted by the hypothesis. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together: This is the critical step that determines the formation of rust. With lesser dissolved iron, fewer bonding opportunities for free oxygen would be available, leading to the formation of less iron oxide. 6. They form iron oxide, which is rust: Due to the reduced bonding between dissolved iron and free oxygen caused by the perturbation hypothesis, less rust would be formed as a direct consequence. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis asserting that less dissolved iron would lead to less rust formation holds true. The hypothesis has both direct and indirect effects on the rusting process. The direct effect occurs in steps 3, 5, and 6, where the reduction in dissolved iron reduces the amount of iron oxide or rust formed. The indirect effects are observed in the possible reasons behind the reduced dissolution, such as barriers, coatings, or impurities impacting the overall reaction rate, which may also play a role in minimizing the rusting process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which ex-European colony in China is at the mouth of the Canton River?","completion":"The ex-European colony in China, located at the mouth of the Canton River, is Macau. Macau, also spelled as Macao, is a former colony of the Portuguese Empire and situated on the southern coast of China, near the Pearl River Delta. It consists of the Macau Peninsula, Taipa Island, Coloane Island, and Cotai, which is a strip of reclaimed land connecting Taipa and Coloane. The history of Macau as a European colony dates back to the mid-16th century when Portuguese navigators first arrived in the region. The Portuguese sought to establish a commercial trading stopover on their way to Japan and other Asian markets. In 1557, the Ming dynasty allowed the Portuguese to establish a permanent settlement in Macau, making it the first European enclave in East Asia. During Portuguese rule, Macau grew as an important port for both European and Chinese merchants. It became a crucial hub for international trade, particularly in silk, porcelain, and tea, from China to other parts of the world. The territory also witnessed the rise of Catholicism, with numerous churches and seminaries built by Jesuits and other European missionaries as a base for their efforts to evangelize throughout China and neighboring regions. Over time, other European powers, especially the British with their colony in Hong Kong, increased their influence in the region, causing Macau's significance to decline. The dilution of Portuguese power and influence, compounded by internal challenges in Portugal itself, resulted in a weakened hold over the territory. In 1974, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal marked a turning point for Macau, as the new government sought to abandon Portugal's colonial past and started negotiations with the People's Republic of China to return the territory to Chinese rule. After years of negotiations, the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration treaty was signed on April 13, 1987, establishing that Macau would become a Chinese Special Administrative Region (SAR) under the \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" principle. On December 20, 1999, Macau's sovereignty was officially transferred back to China, making it the last European colony in Asia to be returned. Today, Macau operates under the \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" framework, which allows it to maintain its legal and economic systems separate from those in mainland China. Macau has transformed itself into a significant center for the gaming and tourism industries, attracting millions of visitors annually."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I realized that maybe he wasn't entirely to blame for what happened between us. We both had our flaws and mistakes that we needed to acknowledge and own up to if we wanted to move forward. I took a deep breath, bracing myself for the emotional honesty that this conversation was going to require. \\"I don't hate you,\\" I admitted. \\"And I don't want to hate you either. I think it's time for both of us to let go of whatever grudges we may still be harboring.\\" He looked up at me, his eyes filled with relief and gratitude. \\"Thank you,\\" he said softly. \\"I want us to be friends, too. I've missed you.\\" I smiled at him, feeling a genuine sense of relief as a weight I hadn't even realized I was carrying began to lift. \\"Let's start fresh, then. No more dwelling on the past or throwing it in each other's faces. Just support, understanding, and hopefully a new chapter of friendship.\\" He smiled back, the strain of past hurt and anger gone from his face. \\"I'd like that more than anything.\\" And so, with a handshake that was as much a symbol of closure as it was a new beginning, we decided to move forward, leaving the baggage of past relationships and heartaches behind us. It wouldn't be easy, and we knew that there might be times when old wounds would resurface, but we were determined to try – for friendship and for ourselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The day was like any other day in his life, Tom walked past the shop on the street corner. He stopped to look at the front row of shoes, and he felt happy to see that the pair of shoes he wanted very much was still there. Looking down, he felt sorry for himself. He really wanted to have them for his birthday. He sadly walked away and thought how to tell his mother about it. He knew she would give him anything he liked if she could. But he also knew very well she had little money. He decided not to go home at once, as he looked worried and his mother would notice it. So he went to the park and sat on the grass. Then he saw a boy in a wheel chair . He noticed that the boy moved the wheel with his hands. Tom looked at him carefully and was surprised to see the boy have no feet. He looked at his own feet. \\"It's much better to be without shoes than without feet, \\"he thought. There was no reason for him to feel so sorry and sad. He went away and smiled, thinking he was happier Question: Tom went into the park because he _ . Answer: Available options: A). was thinking how to tell his mother about it; B). wanted to see the boy; C). didn't want to make his mother worried; D). he felt sad;","completion":"Tom went into the park because he didn't want to make his mother worried. In the article, it is mentioned that Tom decided not to go home at once as he looked worried and his mother would notice it. When he felt this concern, he diverted his path to the park. His reasoning was based on the understanding of his mother's situation and his unwillingness to add more worry to her. Furthermore, there’s no indication that he knew about the boy in the wheelchair prior to going to the park, so he did not know he would see the boy there as he had never been mentioned before. His sadness is a contributing factor to his worry, but it's not the direct reason he chose to go to the park. The primary driving force was his consideration for his mother’s feelings. Therefore, option C explains the main reason Tom went to the park."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

If it's true that humans evolved from monkeys why is that all monkeys are not evolved yet? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"First, let's discuss the first question: If humans evolved from apes, why are there still apes? Step 1: Understand the background of human evolution. It's important to understand that humans did not directly evolve from the modern apes or monkeys we see today. Instead, human beings share a common ancestor with apes and other primates. Step 2: Clarify the evolutionary process. In the process of evolution, when a population is divided into groups that are geographically isolated and experience different environmental pressures, they develop different traits through a combination of natural selection and genetic drift. Over time, these groups accumulate enough genetic differences to be considered separate species. Step 3: Explain why apes still exist. There are still apes because they belong to a different evolutionary branch. Just like humans, apes have continued to evolve over millions of years, adapting to their respective environments. The common ancestor of humans and apes eventually split into different lineages, one leading to humans and the others to various ape species. Now, let's answer the second question: If it's true that humans evolved from monkeys why is that all monkeys are not evolved yet? Step 1: Clarify the misconception. Similar to the previous question, this misconception arises from the idea that humans evolved directly from monkeys. Humans and monkeys share a more distant common ancestor than humans and apes do. To put it simply, humans didn't evolve directly from monkeys we see today. Step 2: Explain the continuous nature of evolution. Evolution is an ongoing process, and there is no endpoint or final destination. The term \\"evolve\\" might give the impression that certain species have reached a final stage, while others have not. In reality, every species is always evolving to adapt to its environment. Lastly, let's analyze if these questions have the same meaning. While both questions revolve around the concept of human evolution and its relation to other primates, they differ in their specific focus. The first question refers to the relationship between humans and apes, whereas the second question focuses on humans and monkeys. So, to some extent, both questions are different, but they are interconnected in the sense that they are based on a common misconception concerning the nature of evolutionary relationships between human and non-human primate species."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The song was part of the soundtrack to the 1980 film \\"Urban Cowboy\\" which starred John Travolta and Debra Winger. The film, set in the backdrop of the country-western culture in Texas, played a significant role in popularizing country music in the 1980s. Johnny Lee, born as John Lee Ham on July 3, 1946, in Texas City, Texas, is a singer known for his distinctively smooth vocal style and passionate delivery. Before his solo career, Lee performed as part of various bands and even as a backup vocalist for Mickey Gilley. \\"Lookin' for Love,\\" written by Wanda Mallette, Bob Morrison, and Patti Ryan, was a major hit for Johnny Lee. The song claimed the number-one spot on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and also crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number five, making it a crossover success. The song has since become synonymous with the movie and is considered a classic in the country music genre. The lyrics of the song resonate with many listeners, as it narrates the tale of someone searching for love and companionship, only to find heartache and disappointment repeatedly. The chorus emphasizes the constant search for love in all the wrong places and expresses the desire to find a loving and stable relationship. In conclusion, \\"Lookin' for Love\\" is a song that articulates the universal longing for love and the struggles involved in finding meaningful relationships.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (; 15 October 1881 - 14 February 1975) was an English author and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. Born in Guildford, the son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. A third milestone in Wodehouse's life came towards the end of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances--a good run by the standards of the day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917-18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin. Unlike his original model, Gilbert, Wodehouse preferred the music to be written first, fitting his words into the melodies. Donaldson suggests that this is the reason why his lyrics have largely been overlooked in recent years: they fit the music perfectly, but do not stand on their own in verse form as Gilbert's do. Nonetheless, Donaldson adds, the book and lyrics for the Princess Theatre shows made the collaborators an enormous fortune and played an important part in the development of the American musical. In the Grove Dictionary of American Music Larry Stempel writes, \\"By presenting naturalistic stories and characters and attempting to integrate the songs and lyrics into the action of the libretto, these works brought a new level of intimacy, cohesion, and sophistication to American musical comedy.\\" The theatre writer Gerald Bordman calls Wodehouse \\"the most observant, literate, and witty lyricist of his day\\". The composer Richard Rodgers wrote, \\"Before Larry Hart, only P.G. Wodehouse had made any real assault on the intelligence of the song-listening public.\\" In the years after the war, Wodehouse steadily increased his sales, polished his existing characters and introduced new ones. Bertie and Jeeves, Lord Emsworth and his circle, and Ukridge appeared in novels and short stories; Psmith made his fourth and last appearance; two new characters were the Oldest Member, narrating his series of golfing stories, and Mr Mulliner, telling his particularly tall tales to fellow patrons of the bar at the Angler's Rest. Various other young men-about-town appeared in short stories about members of the Drones Club. The Wodehouses returned to England, where they had a house in London for some years, but Wodehouse continued to cross the Atlantic frequently, spending substantial periods in New York. He continued to work in the theatre. During the 1920s he collaborated on nine musical comedies produced on Broadway or in the West End, including the long-running Sally (1920, New York), The Cabaret Girl (1922, London) and Rosalie (1928, New York). He also wrote non-musical plays, including The Play's the Thing (1926), adapted from Ferenc Molnar, and A Damsel in Distress (1928), a dramatisation of his 1919 novel. Though never a naturally gregarious man, Wodehouse was more sociable in the 1920s than at other periods. Donaldson lists among those with whom he was on friendly terms writers including A.A. Milne, Ian Hay, Frederick Lonsdale and E. Phillips Oppenheim, and stage performers including George Grossmith, Jr., Heather Thatcher and Dorothy Dickson. what shows did he write?","completion":"P.G.

The statement accused South Korea of “insult and mockery” because it expressed sympathy over the North Korean leader’s death but will not send an official delegation to his funeral. The New York Times notes that the North has promised to open its air and land border to allow South Korean funeral-goers into the country. South Korea has granted authorization to a few citizens who wish to attend Kim’s funeral, including the late President Kim Dae-jung’s widows, but North Korea wants its neighbor to allow anyone to attend. That’s not the only drama related to the guest list for Wednesday’s funeral: The Guardian reports that, while a Japanese celebrity magician known as Princess Tenko has been invited, Kim Jong Il’s oldest son has not.

The leaders of South Korea were sad for their neighbors and said so, but they didn't want to send special people called a \\"delegation\\" to the funeral. That made the people in North Korea unhappy. North Korea told South Korea that they should let some people from South Korea come to the funeral. They even said they would open the doors between their lands to let people in.

But Kim Jong Il's oldest son, Kim Jong Nam, was not invited. A long time ago, he tried to go to Japan using a fake passport to visit a fun place called Tokyo Disneyland. Because of that, he had to live away from North Korea. And so, the funeral was causing some disagreements between the lands of North and South Korea, making it a bit tense for everyone.

Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the...

Let's solve this step-by-step: Step 1: First, let's combine similar terms on the right side of the equation. So, you add -17*u with -32*u. That equals -49*u. So your equation now is: 34 * u = -49 * u + 830. Step 2: Now, let's move -49*u to the left side of that \\"equals\\" sign, so we are adding instead of subtracting. This means add +49*u to both sides of equation. Like, -49*u added to 49*u equals 0, right? Just like magic, it disappears from the right side! So the new equation is: 34*u + 49*u = 830. Step 3: Add 34*u + 49*u together. That equals to 83*u. So now your equation is: 83 * u = 830. Step 4: To solve for u, we want to get u all by itself. To do that, we should divide both sides of the equation by 83. Like this: 83 * u / 83 = 830 / 83. After doing that, u equals to 10, as 830 divided by 83 equals to 10. So, the solution for u is 10!

He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture.

Raymond Davis was set free by a court in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore after family members of the victims submitted affidavits saying they were prepared to forgive Davis in return for blood money. The release marks the end of tensions that had plunged relations between the top intelligence agencies of the two countries, already fractious allies, to a low point. While Davis' release may improve ties between Washington and Islamabad, it is further inflaming the Pakistani public, with whom the case had generated a fierce wave of anti-American sentiment. Much of the local media are taking a hostile position, denouncing the outcome of the case and reporting that the victims' families were pressured into accepting the blood money. (Some originally refused.) And some commentators say the court's verdict is further evidence of Pakistani weakness. Already, an angry backlash has begun, including street protests. (See pictures of Pakistan's class divisions and ethnic rivalries.) Under Pakistani law, blood money is a legal means of securing forgiveness from victims. Under the qasas and diyat laws, derived from Islamic jurisprudence, a court can release an accused person if the victim's family agrees to a satisfactory cash settlement. The Shari'a-based laws are invoked in the majority of murder cases, Pakistani legal experts say. According to government officials in Punjab, Davis was charged with murder on Wednesday but then acquitted after the families of the two victims said in court that they forgave the CIA contractor and submitted documents attesting to that. Senior Pakistani officials tell TIME that each victim's family received 700,000 in compensation, for a total of 1.4 million. The formula to secure Davis' release was devised by Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S. Haqqani, who is well versed in Islamic law, first discussed the proposal with Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and co-author of a major aid package for Pakistan, Pakistani officials tell TIME. By invoking the Shari'a-based provision, the two countries could work together toward a settlement that did not have to rely on Davis' disputed status as a diplomat protected under the Vienna Convention and immune from prosecution. While Washington has always maintained that Davis was protected under diplomatic immunity, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the Foreign Minister at the time, said he wasn't. A Lahore court ruled that Davis didn't enjoy diplomatic immunity last week. (See \\"The Raymond Davis Affair: Are CIA and ISI Ties Doomed?\\") Kerry took the proposal to Pakistan in late February and discussed it with senior Pakistani leaders from all sides. As TIME reported on Feb. 26, the proposal was then taken up as part of direct negotiations between the CIA and its Pakistani equivalent, the ISI. By not accepting Washington's claims of immunity and leaving the issue unresolved, Pakistan was allowed to \\"save face,\\" a senior Pakistan official says. The Pakistan government insisted that the matter be resolved through the country's court system. But the two sides did not reach an immediate agreement. The negotiations were drawn out and, in the process, pressure was discreetly applied on the civilian government by the ISI to secure an unprecedented two-year extension for its chief, Lieut. General Ahmed Shuja Pasha. The message was that it would not be prudent to replace him amid a major crisis involving the CIA. Pasha, who was already on a one-year extension, was due to retire on March 18, his 59th birthday. Some observers believe that Saudi Arabia might have played a mediating role, but officials denied it. The hope was that Riyadh would be able to tamp down tensions between the CIA and the ISI, with Saudi intelligence chief Prince Muqrin bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud playing a role. The Saudis might also have been able to cool those among Pakistan's religious right who had been taking to the streets in the tens of thousands to demand that Davis be hanged. Riyadh wields some influence over the Punjab government, which is headed by the younger brother of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, a prominent Saudi ally. In the end, the Saudi role was not needed, because the Punjab government chose not to interfere with the settlement or seek to undermine it. The ISI approached the families of the victims and asked them to accept compensation, Pakistani officials tell TIME. Eventually, 18 members of the victims' families signed affidavits saying they were prepared to forgive Davis. On Wednesday, the Lahore court also acquitted Davis on the charge of possessing illegal weapons, after fining him 235 and saying that time already spent in prison was punishment enough. Davis has now left Pakistan for Kabul and is expected to travel to the U.S. soon. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this article include: 1. A CIA contractor named Raymond Davis who was charged with double murder in Pakistan has been released. He was set free by a court in Lahore after the victims' families agreed to forgive him in return for \\"blood money,\\" a payment which is a legal way to forgive someone in Pakistan. 2. This release has reduced some tension between the U.S. and Pakistan, but it made many people in Pakistan very upset. Some people there think that the victims' families were forced to take the money and forgive Davis. 3. The plan to release Davis was created by the Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. and a U.S. Senator, John Kerry. The plan helped both countries work together without needing to argue about whether Davis should be protected under international law. 4. Some people thought Saudi Arabia might help calm things down between the U.S. and Pakistan, but in the end, they weren't needed. 5. After his release, Davis was also found not guilty of having illegal weapons, but had to pay a 235 fine. He has now left Pakistan and is expected to return to the U.S. soon."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

By comparison, 9.8 million households, or 9 percent of all US households were headed by an adult raising a child alone. The 1990 census showed 26 percent of homes were led by a married mother and father, and 8 percent of homes were led by a single parent. Similar increases occurred in other countries. In the UK, lone-parent homes increased from 3.3 percent in 1990 to 5.5 percent in 1999. Single parent households in Australia rose from 5.8 percent in 1990 to 7.6 percent in 1999. Belgium saw the increase from 1.8 percent to 2.7 percent during the same period of time. These countries tend to have greater acceptance of the single parent because there are fewer nearby family members to disapprove, Riche, a Census Bureau director, said. Just as in the US, those changes raised new questions about how involved govenment should be in helping single parent families. Some research suggests children raised in two-parent families are better off than those who depend on one. \\"The position of one-parent families in any country is very much a gender issue-women's opportunities, especially working-class women on low income,\\" said Sue Cohen, coordinator of the Single Action Parents Network in England.

Question: Information: - Florence is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the Metropolitan City of Florence. It is the most populous city in Tuscany, with 383,083 inhabitants, expanding to over 1,520,000 in the metropolitan area. - Benedetto Ghirlandaio (14581497) was an Italian (Florentine) painter. His brothers Davide Ghirlandaio (14521525) and Domenico Ghirlandaio (14491494) were both painters, as was his nephew Ridolfo Ghirlandaio (14831561). Benedetto died in Florence on 17 July 1497. - Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 18 February 1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered to be the greatest living artist during his lifetime, he has since been described as one of the greatest artists of all time. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici client, Leonardo da Vinci. - Davide Ghirlandaio (14521525), also known as David Ghirlandaio and as Davide Bigordi, was an Italian painter and mosaicist, active in his native Florence. - Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449 11 January 1494) was an Italian Renaissance painter from Florence. Ghirlandaio was part of the so-called \\"third generation\\" of the Florentine Renaissance, along with Verrocchio, the Pollaiolo brothers and Sandro Botticelli. Ghirlandaio was the leader of a large and efficient workshop which included his brothers Davide Ghirlandaio and Benedetto Ghirlandaio, his brother-in-law Bastiano Mainardi from San Gimignano and later his son Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. Among the many apprentices that passed through his workshop, the most famous was Michelangelo. Ghirlandaio's particular talent was his ability to depict contemporary life and portraits of contemporary people within the context of religious narratives. This brought him great popularity and many large commissions. - Giorgio Vasari (30 July 1511 27 June 1574) was an Italian painter, architect, writer, and historian, most famous today for his \\"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\\", considered the ideological foundation of art-historical writing. - Filippo Brunelleschi (1377 April 15, 1446) was an Italian designer and a key figure in architecture, recognised to be the first modern engineer, planner and sole construction supervisor. He was one of the founding fathers of the Renaissance. He is generally well known for developing a technique for linear perspective in art and for building the dome of the Florence Cathedral. Heavily depending on mirrors and geometry, to \\"reinforce Christian spiritual reality\\", his formulation of linear perspective governed pictorial depiction of space until the late 19th century. It also had the most profound and quite unanticipated influence on the rise of modern science. His accomplishments also include other architectural works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and ship design. His principal surviving works are to be found in Florence, Italy. Unfortunately, his two original linear perspective panels have been lost. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Ridolfo Ghirlandaio (or Ghirlandajo) (Florence 14 February 1483 6 June 1561) was an Italian Renaissance painter active mainly in Florence. Ridolfo Ghirlandaio was the son of the Italian Renaissance painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. - Lorenzo de' Medici (1 January 1449 9 April 1492) was an Italian statesman and \\"de facto\\" ruler of the Florentine Republic, who was one of the most powerful and enthusiastic patrons of the Renaissance. Also known as Lorenzo the Magnificent (\\"Lorenzo il Magnifico\\" ) by contemporary Florentines, he was a magnate, diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists and poets. He is well known for his contribution to the art world by sponsoring artists such as Botticelli and Michelangelo. His life coincided with the mature phase of Italian Renaissance and his death coincided with the end of the Golden Age of Florence. The fragile peace that he helped maintain among the various Italian states collapsed with his death. He is buried in the Medici Chapel in Florence. - The Ospedale degli Innocenti ('Hospital of the Innocents', also known in old Tuscan dialect as the Spedale degli Innocenti) is a historical building in Florence, Italy. It was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, who received the commission in 1419 from the Arte della Seta. It was originally a children's orphanage. It is regarded as a notable example of early Italian Renaissance architecture. The hospital, which features a nine bay loggia facing the Piazza SS. Annunziata, was built and managed by the \\"Arte della Seta\\" or Silk Guild of Florence. That guild was one of the wealthiest in the city and, like most guilds, took upon itself philanthropic duties. - Bastiano Mainardi (1460 1513) was an Italian painter born in San Gimignano. - Bartolom ( m ) eo di Giovanni , also known as Alunno di Domenico for his relation to his master Domenico Ghirlandaio , was an early Renaissance Italian painter of the Florentine School who was active from about 1488 until his death in 1501 . He studied with and assisted Domenico Ghirlandaio , painting the predella of Ghirlandaio 's Adoration of the Magi in the Ospedale degli Innocenti , the foundling hospital in Florence , in 1488 . Bartolomeo di Giovanni also worked under the guidance of Sandro Botticelli . This painter should not be confused with either the Italian sculptor and architect , Bartolomeo di Giovanni d'Astore Sinibaldi ( 1469 -- 1535 ) , or with the Italian painter and architect , Bartolommeo di Giovanni Corradini ( active mid- 15th century ) . - Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, known as Sandro Botticelli (c. 1445 May 17, 1510), was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. He belonged to the Florentine School under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement that Giorgio Vasari would characterize less than a hundred years later in his \\"Vita\\" of Botticelli as a \\"golden age\\". Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then, his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Question: suppose more water is transported to the leaves happens, how will it affect MORE cells being damaged. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"When more water is transported to the leaves of a plant, it can have a range of effects on the cells and overall health of the plant. To better understand this situation, let us first explore the process of water transportation in plants and the role it plays in maintaining overall plant health. Water transportation in plants primarily occurs through the xylem, a specialized tissue responsible for carrying water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant. This process is driven by transpiration, the evaporation of water from the surfaces of the leaves, which creates a negative pressure that pulls water upward from the roots through the xylem. The possible perturbation from the question refers to an increased water transportation to the leaves. This could be caused by factors such as increased root water uptake, increased transpiration rates, or abnormally high humidity levels. This situation may have several effects on the cells within the plant, particularly in the leaves. 1. More Turgor Pressure: Increased water transportation to the leaves may lead to a higher turgor pressure in the cells, as the water content in the leaf cells increases correspondingly. Turgor pressure is the pressure of water inside a plant cell's central vacuole against the cell wall. Increased turgor pressure can help the plant maintain its structural integrity and possibly increase growth rates, but excessive turgor pressure may lead to damaged or ruptured cells due to the increased stress on the cell walls. 2. Overhydration or Hypoxia: If too much water is transported to the leaves, the plant tissues may experience overhydration, which can disrupt cellular functions and lead to the loss of solute concentrations within the cells. Additionally, excess water in the cells may reduce the availability of oxygen, resulting in hypoxia or oxygen deficiency. This condition can harm the cells, impairing cellular respiration and energy production processes. 3. Increased Susceptibility to Pathogens: Higher water content in the leaf tissues might create a more favorable environment for the growth of certain pathogens like fungi and bacteria. Damp conditions can facilitate the spread of diseases, leading to more cells being damaged in the plant. Considering the potential effects of increased water transportation to the leaves listed above, we can infer that this perturbation may result in more cells being damaged in the following ways: - Increased turgor pressure might cause damage to or rupture certain cells with weaker cell walls. - Overhydration and hypoxia can impact cellular function and induce cellular stress, contributing to cell damage or death. - Elevated levels of water in the leaf tissues might increase the plant's susceptibility to pathogens, leading to the infection and destruction of more cells. Overall, there are several factors to consider when evaluating the impact of increased water transportation to the leaves. While an optimal water balance is crucial for maintaining plant health and function, excess water transport may cause more damage to the cells within the plant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The 58-year-old former Bournemouth, Doncaster Rovers, Crawley Town, Nottingham Forest and Bristol City manager has signed an 18-month deal. O'Driscoll, who won promotion with both Bournemouth and Doncaster, replaces Dean Smith, who left the Saddlers to join Brentford in November. \\"It's an exciting project,\\" he said. \\"I'm relishing the opportunity.\\" Walsall are now third in League One, a place higher than when Smith and his assistant Richard O'Kelly departed on 30 November. They have since spent three matches under the joint caretaker management team of physio Jon Whitney, goalkeeping coach Neil Cutler and the vastly experienced John Ward, who will all remain on the Bescot backroom team. Whitney is promoted to the role of first team & performance coach, Cutler becomes coach, with a focus on the goalkeepers, and the much-travelled Ward retains his role as performance development coach, with the primary aim of nurturing the Saddlers' young professionals. O'Driscoll was appointed assistant manager by Liverpool in the summer but left Anfield in October after Brendan Rodgers was sacked, prior to Jurgen Klopp's arrival. \\"I've watched Walsall a lot over the last two or three seasons. I've always enjoyed coming here,\\" new Saddlers boss O'Driscoll told BBC WM. \\"I know Dean Smith and Richard O'Kelly well. We share the same philosophy. I know the things they've tried to instil. It's taken a long time but the club is now reaping the rewards. That was the attraction. \\"I spent some time with them on the training ground about a month ago and you could see the players are committed to it, that they're a group of players who want to be successful. \\"Walsall have gained the sort of reputation that can take years to bring to fruition and can be destroyed in seconds. I've no intention of doing that. \\"You're not going to improve it by suddenly reversing everything they've been doing. That would cause chaos. But can we take it to the next level? That's to win the games we've been drawing and draw the games we've lost and see where that takes us at the end of the season.\\" Walsall chairman Jeff Bonser believes O'Driscoll will continue the club's philosophy of producing young players and playing attractive football. \\"Sean ticks all the boxes in terms of the identity, blueprint and ethos that we work towards,\\" he said. \\"We believe in his ability to advance the football club, enhance our growing reputation as a progressive, forward-thinking organisation in what we hope will be an exciting new chapter at the club.\\" As a player, Wolverhampton-born O'Driscoll played for two league clubs, Fulham and Bournemouth, where he made a then club record 423 league appearances before joining the coaching staff at Dean Court. He took over as Bournemouth manager from Mel Machin in August 2000, leading them to promotion in the Third Division play-offs in May 2003. After joining Doncaster in 2006, O'Driscoll led them into the Championship, beating Leeds 1-0 in the 2008 League One play-off final. A short spell at Crawley followed before he left to return to Nottingham Forest, where he had previously been assistant to Steve Cotterill, in July 2012. He was sacked after just five months following a 4-2 Boxing Day win over Leeds, with the club a point off the Championship top six. His last managerial job was at Bristol City, but he was unable to save them from relegation to League One and lasted just 10 months before being replaced by Cotterill, who he himself had replaced at Forest. He was appointed England Under-19s coach in September 2014, a job he did for nine months until becoming Rodgers' assistant at Liverpool.","completion":"A man named Sean O'Driscoll, who used to manage soccer teams like Bournemouth and Doncaster, got a new job!

The incident occurred in the Aquatic Park area on Thursday afternoon. People on a passing sailboat witnessed the attack and rescued the 56-year-old man, who was treated for a \\"serious extremity injury\\". Such attacks are rare, although swimmers have reported incidents in the bay in the past. \\"He was swimming and said a sea lion came up to him and he splashed water on it and it didn't work,\\" Matthew Reiter of the San Francisco Police Department's Marine Unit told Fox News. \\"He yelled at it and then the sea lion came up and bit him on the arm\\". After taking the man on board, the people on the sailboat called the coast guard and the man was taken to hospital for treatment. \\"I mean, the boat saved his life,\\" Mr Reiter, who applied the tourniquet, said. \\"If the boat hadn't been there, who knows what would have happened.\\" Dr Claire Simeon, a vet with the Marine Mammal Center, told CBS SF Bay Area that her research had shown San Francisco swimmers reporting 10 incidents in the area over three years. There were no patterns and swimmers had not appeared to provoke the animals, she said, adding that people should still feel they could go swimming, as long as they maintained a safe distance. In May, a sea lion pulled a young girl into the water at Steveston Fisherman's Wharf in Richmond, western Canada. ||||| - A swimmer was severely injured after being bit in the arm by a sea lion in the Bay on Thursday afternoon. The 56-year-old man was swimming beyond the cove at Aquatic Park and was bitten around 1:45 p.m. \\"He was swimming and said a sea lion came up to him and he splashed water on it and it didn't work. He yelled at it and then the sea lion came up and bit him on the arm and he used his arm to push him away and then it went away and he never saw it again after that,\\" said Matthew Reiter with San Francisco Police Department's Marine Unit. A sailboat happened to be nearby and saw the swimmer in distress, so he pulled the man onto his boat and immediately called police. Police told the captain of that boat to bring him to the Hyde Street pier. John Baxter with the San Francisco Fire Department tells KTVU several tourniquets were applied to the swimmer in an attempt to stop the bleeding. The tourniquet was applied by SFPD at Pier 45. The swift actions by emergency crews contributed to the swimmer's life being saved, according to San Francisco Fire. The swimmer was then transported to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.

KTVU spoke to a couple of swimmers in the area who say seeing sea lions in the water is more common than before. They say if they see a sea lion in the water, they swim the other way and don't make eye contact because they will rush a swimmer and bump them. The swimmers speculate that mating season could be one reason why the sea lions are seemingly more aggressive than normal. There are other theories that swimmers here may be impacting the sea lions. Dr. Claire Simeon, a veterinarian with the Marine Mammal Center, published a study with the University of California at San Francisco in 2015 looking at sea lion and seal bites and scratches. She said researchers talking to the members of two San Francisco swim clubs found only 11 such incidents over a period of three years, and one of those had actually taken place in Washington. The study found no clear patterns or common causes among the incidents. While it was clear that approaching the animals could cause negative reactions, many of the swimmers did not appear to have done anything to provoke the attack. \\"As these animals are wild, their behavior can be erratic,\\" Simeon said. Experts recommend that swimmers and beach goers try to maintain a safe distance from seals and sea lions, as they have sharp teeth and a strong bite. \\"I don't think that people should be afraid to go into the water,\\" Simeon said. \\"We're lucky to be able to share our coastline with these amazing animals.\\" \\"We really want people to leave seals be and enjoy the bay,\\" Simeon said. The SFPD Marine Unit will be advising local swim clubs of the incident.

Marked by vitality , integrity , perseverance , and creativity , Jane 's life and works tell the story of a Royalist woman 's indomitable spirit during the English Civil War and Restoration in England . - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. - Worcester is a city in Worcestershire, England, southwest of Birmingham and north of Gloucester. The population is approximately 100,000. The River Severn flanks the western side of the city centre, which is overlooked by the 12th-century Worcester Cathedral. - Chelsea is an affluent area in southwest London, bounded to the south by the River Thames. Its frontage runs from Chelsea Bridge along the Chelsea Embankment, Cheyne Walk, Lots Road and Chelsea Harbour. Its eastern boundary was once defined by the River Westbourne, which is now in a pipe above Sloane Square tube station. The modern eastern boundary is Chelsea Bridge Road and the lower half of Sloane Street, including Sloane Square. To the north and northwest, the area fades into Knightsbridge and Brompton, but it is considered that the area north of King's Road as far northwest as Fulham Road is part of Chelsea. The football club Chelsea F.C. is based at Stamford Bridge in neighbouring Fulham. - Roundhead was the name given to the supporters of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War. Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against Charles I of England and his supporters, the Cavaliers or Royalists, who claimed rule by absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings. The goal of the Roundhead party was to give the Parliament supreme control over executive administration. - Viscount Newhaven was a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1681 for Charles Cheyne (or Cheyney), Member of Parliament and Clerk of the Pipe. He was made Lord Cheyne at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland. He married Lady Jane Cavendish, daughter of the first Duke of Newcastle and had a son, William Cheyne, who became 2nd Viscount Newhaven. William was a landowner in Chelsea, London, having purchased Henry VIII's palace. He died in 1728 leaving no male heir, the titles becoming extinct. - The Battle of Worcester took place on 3 September 1651 at Worcester, England, and was the final battle of the English Civil War.

It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier. - The Peerage of Scotland is the section of the Peerage of the British Isles for those peers created by the King of Scots before 1707. Following that year's Treaty of Union, the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England were combined under the name of Great Britain, and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

Research the academic calendar and the general education system in South Korea. 2. Identify the typical grade levels and duration of high school education in South Korea. 3. Determine the usual month and timeframe for graduation ceremonies. Step 1: Researching the academic calendar and general education system in South Korea, I found out that the school year is divided into two semesters: the first semester typically starts in March and ends in mid-July, and the second semester starts in late August or early September and ends in mid-February. South Korea's education system consists of six years of elementary school, three years of middle school, and three years of high school. Step 2: Identifying the typical grade levels and duration of high school education, I confirmed that high school is from grade 10 to grade 12 and lasts for a total of three years. Step 3: With the knowledge that the school year in South Korea usually ends in mid-February, it can be inferred that the high school students graduate around late February each year.

Given the below context: The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted, while Léon Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a \\"direct citation\\" of Ingres' portrait. Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, \\"Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference\\". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her \\"massive, monumental presence\\". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, \\"That's Madame Bertin!\\"The influence continued through the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of Ralph Vaughan Williams between 1952 and 1961.

Butt: As mentioned earlier, \\"butt\\" is the informal term for the human buttocks and is synonymous with the term \\"bottom.\\" In the context of the question, where Bob is sitting on a chair, it makes sense to choose this word as it refers to the part of the body that is in contact with the chair. 4. Opera House: An opera house is a theater designed specifically for opera performances. Like the auditorium, it is not a term used to describe a person's bottom. 5. Theatre: A theatre is a building or space in which plays, movies, or other performances can be presented. It still does not describe the body part we are looking for. In conclusion, by evaluating and eliminating each choice, we can confidently confirm that \\"butt\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question, making it the correct choice as the alternative term for \\"bottom\\" in the context of Bob resting his bottom on a chair in the orchestra pit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Sidehackers Movie plot: The film centers on Rommel, a mechanic and sidehack-style racer, who turns down the offer of J.C., a hot-tempered entertainer, to join his act after J.C. witnesses a sidehack race for the first time. During this time, J.C.'s abused girlfriend, Paisley, falls for Rommel and attempts to seduce him. He rejects her advances and sends her away crying. Later, when J.C. and his crew return to their hotel, they find Paisley drunk and her clothes tattered, claiming that Rommel raped her. Angered, J.C. and his gang beat Rommel unconscious and kill his fiancee, Rita. Rommel then spends the rest of the movie plotting his revenge against J.C., who goes into hiding from the police. The film's end is nihilistic in nature. After both Rommel and J.C.'s men have killed each other (while two of Rommel's men escaped on a sidehack bike), the two men brawl. When Rommel manages to gain the upper hand, he elects to walk away when the police are about to arrive, but J.C. picks up a gun and shoots Rommel from behind. The last images of the film are a flashback of Rommel and his fiancee rolling about in a grassy field, superimposed over a shot of Rommel's dead body. My question: How does Rommel die?

Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that \\"there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks,\\" and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that \\"some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species.

He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which species' traits would be less common, species A or species B? Hint: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. A:","completion":"Based on the theory of evolution by natural selection, species B's traits would be less common since they have harmful traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas. Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots? A:","completion":"Since Ann did not candy the apricots, comparing the crystallized sugar content of candied plums and candied apricots is not possible. However, if you meant to compare the natural sugar content of fresh plums and apricots, apricots tend to have slightly higher sugar content than plums.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Virginia legislature has excised the words “sea level rise” from a study on the impact of climate change, because it is apparently a “left wing term.” State lawmakers wanted to commission a study on rising sea levels, given that Virginia is highly vulnerable to flooding, and that scientists predict that Virginia’s sea level will rise by two to three feet in the next 100 years. Republicans in the state legislature agreed — as long as “liberal code words” like “sea level rise” and “climate change” were left out of the proposal: State Del. Chris Stolle, R-Virginia Beach, who insisted on changing the “sea level rise” study in the General Assembly to one on “recurrent flooding,” said he wants to get political speech out of the mix altogether. He said “sea level rise” is a “left-wing term” that conjures up animosities on the right. So why bring it into the equation? Stolle seems to believe, as comedian Stephen Colbert famously put it, that “reality has a well-known liberal bias.” Democratic State Senator Ralph Northam, who co-sponsored the study, told the The Virginian-Pilot that Stolle threatened that the study “would end up in the circular file” unless the phrase “sea level rise” was removed. So Northam and other Democrats agreed amend the proposal, believing that the study was more important than the language used to describe it. The Virginia Institute of Marine Scienece is currently leading the research, with results due by the end of the year. Still, as Democratic State Delegate Kenneth Alexander told The Virginian-Pilot, “I question whether we’re doing the public a disservice by not telling it the way it is.” The move to censor scientific language on climate change is reminiscent of North Carolina Republicans’ recent plan to essentially ban the scientific method. Virginia is at least acknowledging that climate change is happening — they just refuse to label it as such. ||||| State lawmakers ran into a problem this year when recommending a study on rising sea levels and their potential impacts on coastal Virginia. It was not a scientific problem or a financial one. It was linguistic. They discovered that they could not use the phrases \\"sea level rise\\" or \\"climate change\\" in requesting the study, in part because of objections from Republican colleagues and also for fear of stirring up conservative activists, some of whom believe such terms are liberal code words. On its website, for example, the Virginia tea party described the proposed \\"sea level rise\\" study this way: \\"More wasted tax dollars for more ridiculous studies designed to separate us from our money and control all land and water use.\\" The group urged its members to contact elected officials right away to defeat the measure: \\"They will pass this without blinking if we don't yell loudly.\\" So lawmakers did away with all mention of sea level rise, substituting a more politically neutral phrase: \\"recurrent flooding.\\" The amended study, while fixed on the same research, sailed through the General Assembly and was signed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, who also has raised questions about what is causing slightly higher temperatures on the planet. The episode illustrates the continuing, even increasing, volatility of climate change as a policy issue in Virginia, at the same time that other states and whole nations are moving forward with plans to combat the phenomenon. It also shows how climate skeptics, through their political connections and organization, are forcing state and local government to stay clear of certain buzzwords in quietly pursuing a strategy, else they risk unleashing a brawl. Government officials and scientists just shrug when asked about the language games, especially when the subject is sea level rise. To them, the debate should not be about what is causing waters to slowly rise, but what should be done about it. \\"These studies need to be done if we're going to logically tackle these problems that scientific data unequivocally proves are happening,\\" said Larry Atkinson, an oceanographer at Old Dominion University who is overseeing a climate change initiative that focuses on rising sea levels. \\"So, whatever we have to call it, I've got no problem with that,\\" he added. \\"What's the alternative? Do nothing?\\" The semantics dance harkens to the days when \\"global warming\\" was commonly uttered. But after conservatives criticized and ridiculed Al Gore and others, \\"climate change\\" became the kinder, gentler way to communicate the same thing. Now it appears that \\"climate change\\" and \\"sea level rise\\" are being phased out, in Virginia at least, amid political pressure from the far right. Emerging labels include \\"increased flooding risk,\\" \\"coastal resiliency\\" and, of course, \\"recurrent flooding.\\" State Del. Chris Stolle, R-Virginia Beach, who insisted on changing the \\"sea level rise\\" study in the General Assembly to one on \\"recurrent flooding,\\" said he wants to get political speech out of the mix altogether. He said \\"sea level rise\\" is a \\"left-wing term\\" that conjures up animosities on the right. So why bring it into the equation? \\"What people care about is the floodwater coming through their door,\\" Stolle said. \\"Let's focus on that. Let's study that. So that's what I wanted us to call it.\\" According to scientific tide measurements at Sewells Point in Norfolk, the sea level has risen by 14.5 inches in the past 100 years. The trend is projected to continue for at least the next century, and some scientists predict that the rate could accelerate, with the level rising an additional 2 to 3 feet by 2100, and perhaps higher. What seems certain is that Norfolk and the rest of coastal Virginia are going to get wetter, with more frequent flooding and more waterfront property and infrastructure at risk. Complicating the problem is that, at the same time, land is sinking, a process called subsidence. Scientists are not sure at what rate the soft, marshy region is sinking, only that it plays a significant role in calculating \\"relative sea level rise.\\" This one-two punch of rising water and sinking land is what makes Hampton Roads the second-most-vulnerable region in the United States to flooding, behind only New Orleans. Given the stakes, environmentalists are frustrated that Virginia has not made sea level rise a priority. And they see the sensitivity over semantics as symbolic of state reluctance to dive into a politically divisive topic. The city of Norfolk, which is especially vulnerable to rising sea waters and subsidence, given its geography and marshy footprint, today is developing a \\"flooding strategy\\" through a \\"citizens flooding task force.\\" Members include residents from neighborhoods that routinely flood after minor rains and slightly higher tide cycles. The city also recently launched a \\"flooding awareness\\" website about its efforts. But the phrases \\"sea level rise\\" and \\"climate change\\" cannot be found there. Fleta Jackson, a spokeswoman for the city's stormwater division, said the absence is not intentional. \\"Sea level rise is definitely a part of the conversation,\\" Jackson said. \\"It just doesn't appear in a definitive statement.\\" The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality is the clearinghouse for federal grants helping to pay for three specific studies of sea level rise in Hampton Roads, the Middle Peninsula and Northern Virginia. At each stage of the studies, the state has altered its verbiage, said Laura Mc-Kay, state director of coastal zone management programs. At first, McKay said, the studies were about \\"climate change.\\" Then they were changed to \\"sea level rise.\\" Now they are about \\"coastal resilience.\\" And while the studies themselves are slightly different, McKay said, political sensitivities played a role. \\"It's kind of silly,\\" she said. \\"But the reality is, some of the phrases just really send people screaming. We want to use language that doesn't alienate people.\\" Kris Allen, a Virginia Beach businessman, is one climate skeptic who believes sea level rise is real, is a problem and should be studied and acted upon. Indeed, he would prefer that state and local studies be labeled as such. He gets upset, however, when government wants to prescribe economically harmful regulations on coal and gas and enact strategies such as cap-and-trade to combat a phenomenon that might be more about sinking land. \\"It's a game about control,\\" Allen said, echoing a sentiment that government is really after more control of property rights and individual liberty. State Sen. Ralph Northam, D-Norfolk, co-sponsored the \\"recurrent flooding\\" study that eventually won approval in the General Assembly this year. He said that when he met with state Del. Stolle, the co-patron in the House, he was told that the phrase \\"sea level rise\\" needed to go or the study \\"would end up in the circular file.\\" So Northam and other Democrats agreed to amend the proposal. \\"It's kind of embarrassing that people are playing politics instead of just talking straight,\\" Northam said. \\"But we went along with it. We needed the study done.\\" Today, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science is leading the 138,000 \\"flooding\\" study, along with scientists from the University of Virginia and ODU. Their work is expected to be completed by the end of the year, offering officials from low-lying Hampton Roads, the Eastern Shore and other coastal areas insight and ideas about rising waters and increased flooding. State officials also hope the results will help win federal funds for combating sea level rise and coastal flooding, either by constructing sea walls or berms, or by elevating streets and moving infrastructure inland. \\"I question whether we're doing the public a disservice by not telling it the way it is,\\" said state Del. Kenneth Alexander, D-Norfolk, who also voted to amend the study name. \\"But we can't continue to dismiss it or kick it down the road.\\" Scott Harper, 757-446-2340, scott.harper@pilotonline.com ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The Virginia legislature has opted to remove the terms \\"sea level rise\\" and \\"climate change\\" from a study on the impact of climate change, due to it being perceived as a \\"left-wing term.\\" State lawmakers wanted to commission a study on rising sea levels, since Virginia faces a high risk of flooding and scientists predict that the state's sea level will rise by two to three feet in the next 100 years.

This article: Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C.

This aspect of the quarry might attract the interest of geologists, paleontologists, and ecology enthusiasts who value the scientific insights that the quarry provides. However, it is important to note that the SSSI designation does not guarantee a high number of fans but does indicate that the quarry has scientific merit. Brofiscin Quarry has also been used as a dumping ground for toxic waste, including PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), for about seven years. This fact might elicit interest from environmental activists and researchers who focus on the impacts of pollution and waste disposal on natural habitats. Studying the quarry's history and current conditions could provide valuable information for these individuals. Nevertheless, this aspect does not necessarily equate to the presence of a large fan base. In 2011, the quarry was capped, which means that the toxic waste dump was sealed off to prevent further contamination. This marks the end of its use as a landfill and establishes the beginning of the site's remediation process, which could, in turn, attract ecologists and conservationists interested in the area's recovery and rehabilitation. However, it is yet unclear if these individuals would identify as \\"fans\\" of the site. In conclusion, while the Brofiscin Quarry in Groes-faen has historical, scientific, and environmental significance, there is not enough evidence in the information provided to demonstrate conclusively that the site has many fans. The quarry may hold interest for various specialized groups or individuals, but the number of people who might be passionate or enthusiastic about the site cannot be explicitly derived from the facts presented."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

US stocks advance as jobs data reins in Fed rate hike bets US stocks advanced last week to halt a three-day drop, after the smallest jobs gain in seven months fueled speculation the Federal Reserve will look to raise interest rates gradually.

The jobless rate, projected to ease, stayed at 5 percent, while wage growth accelerated. The data adds to speculation the Fed will stick with a slower pace in tightening monetary policy. While traders were pricing in a 10 percent chance of higher borrowing costs next month before the jobs report, the odds fell to just 2 percent after.

Scottish fullback Stuart Hogg, the Lions' youngest player at 20, looked to get his tour off on a positive note but the beginning of a scything run a couple of minutes into the match was brought to juddering halt by a crunching tackle by Barbarians center Casey Lualala.

Just days earlier, the board of American Apparel finally ousted Dov Charney, the company’s flamboyant founder and controversy magnet. And there was Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, standing in front of an audience that included a fair number of corporate directors, urging them to be more accountable. In the speech, at the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University, Ms. White emphasized their crucial duty to protect shareholders from abusive practices at companies they oversee. “Setting the standard in the boardroom that good corporate governance and rigorous compliance are essential goes a long way in engendering a strong corporate culture throughout an organization,” Ms. White said, later adding that “ethics and honesty can become core corporate values when directors and senior executives embrace them.” Why wouldn’t board members embrace these values? Cozy board ties with the chief executive might be one reason. A recent academic study, to be published in the July-August issue of The Accounting Review, suggests that lax oversight can result when a director of a company is friendly with the chief executive overseeing it. But the research makes a counterintuitive finding as well. The conventional wisdom holds that when you disclose personal ties, you create transparency and better governance. The experiment found that when social relationships were disclosed as part of director-independence regulations, board members didn’t toughen their oversight of their chief-executive pals. Rather, the directors went easier on the C.E.O., perhaps believing that they had done their duty by disclosing the relationship. The study, “Will Disclosure of Friendship Ties between Directors and C.E.O.s Yield Perverse Effects?,” was conducted by four academics: Jacob M. Rose and Anna M. Rose of Bentley University, Carolyn Strand Norman of Virginia Commonwealth University and Cheri R. Mazza of Sacred Heart University. Back in 2013, the researchers set out to conduct a thought experiment with a group of directors on the topic of board relationships. The academics secured the participation of 56 current directors at companies of all sizes. The participants had 30 years of business experience, on average, and generally served on multiple boards — 2.64 was the mean. About one-quarter of the directors served on an audit committee. In the experiment, the directors were asked to role-play as board members of a hypothetical biotech company that was about to report earnings for the year. The company had been expected to earn 805 million, the directors were told, but its actual profits were going to be just 800 million. That shortfall would have an impact on the compensation of the chief executive, who would receive a bonus only if the company earned at least 810 million. The directors participating in the experiment were divided into two groups. Two-thirds were told to assume that they had a personal or social relationship with the C.E.O. of the biotech company. The remaining third were told they had no such tie. Of those who were friendly with the executive, half were told that they had disclosed their relationship to the board, to company management and to shareholders. The other half were told to assume that they hadn’t made the disclosure. The only option given to the directors to make up the shortfall — and thus help the C.E.O. get a bonus — was to cut the company’s 40 million budget for research and development. As they weighed this possibility, they were told that for every 1 million cut in that budget, there would be a 1 percent increase in the chance that the company would lose ground to its competitors. Now for the results: Among the directors who counted the C.E.O. as a friend, 46 percent said they would cut research and development by one-quarter or more to ensure a bonus payout to their pal. By contrast, only 6 percent of directors with no personal ties to the chief executive agreed to reduce research and development to generate a bonus. The results get more interesting when disclosure is added to the mix. Of the directors who said they would cut 10 million or more from the budget — the amount necessary to generate a bonus to the chief executive — an astonishing 62 percent had disclosed a friendship with the C.E.O. Only 28 percent of the directors who had not disclosed their relationship with the executive agreed to make the cuts necessary to generate a bonus. Only one director with no ties to the executive agreed to cut the budget by 10 million or more. Mr. Rose, an author of the paper, said he and his colleagues were surprised that so many directors said they’d be willing to put the company at risk to ensure a bonus for their pal, the C.E.O. “If just by mentioning that you’re friends with the C.E.O. it affects their decision-making, we think the effects going on in the real world are much, much larger than what we picked up in the lab,” Mr. Rose said in an interview last week. Even more disturbing, he said, was that so many directors seemed to think that disclosing their friendships with the C.E.O. gave them license to put the executive’s interests ahead of the company’s. “When you disclose things, it may make you feel you’ve met your obligations,” Mr. Rose said. “They’re not all that worried about doing something to help out the C.E.O. because everyone has had a fair warning.” There are two messages in this study. One is for regulators: Simply disclosing a conflict or friendship does not eliminate its potential to create problems. The other is for investors. “Shareholders should take a more active role in finding out what kinds of relationships their boards and C.E.O.s have,” Mr. Rose said, “and recognize the potential traps created by them.” A version of this article appears in print on June 29, 2014, on page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: The C.E.O. Is My Friend. So Back Off..

The study finds that when there is a friendship between a director and a CEO, the oversight provided by the director may become lax. Interestingly, the study also finds that disclosing personal ties between the two parties does not necessarily improve governance. In fact, it shows that board members tend to be more lenient with their CEO friends after disclosing the relationship, perhaps believing that transparency was enough to fulfill their duties. The researchers conducted a thought experiment with 56 current directors from various companies to explore board relationships. The directors were asked to role-play as board members of a hypothetical biotech company with a CEO whose bonus was tied to the company's earnings. The directors had to decide whether they would cut the company's research and development budget to help the CEO reach his bonus target. The results showed that directors with a personal relationship with the CEO were more likely to make budget cuts to help their CEO friend, while those without such ties were less likely to do so. Additionally, disclosing the friendship did not lead to tougher decisions, but rather, more leniency from the directors. This study highlights that simply disclosing a conflict or friendship does not eliminate its potential to create problems. The researchers suggest that shareholders should be more proactive in getting to know the relationships between their boards and CEOs and recognize the potential pitfalls associated with them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the country was first founded in 1776,it was necessary for the settlers to work together to live.They had crossed dangerous seas and risked all they had in their struggle for political and religious freedom.There remains among many Americans a distrust of central government.People still prefer to do things themselves within their communities,rather than give the government more control.

Counting Cars is spinoff similiar to which television series that chronicled the daily activities at \\"Rick's Restorations\\"?","completion":"Counting Cars is a spinoff television series similar to the show \\"American Restoration.\\" American Restoration originally aired on the History Channel and chronicled the daily activities at Rick's Restorations, a shop owned and operated by Rick Dale and his team. The shop specializes in the restoration of classic items, antiques, and unique collectibles to their original condition. The connection between Counting Cars and American Restoration stems from their shared focus on restoration, the presence of a specialized team with expert knowledge, and similar themes related to preserving the value and history of items. Both shows were part of the network's lineup of reality TV series that revolved around skilled craftsmen and their businesses. Moreover, these shows appealed to a wide audience, from automobile enthusiasts to fans of antiques and history. Counting Cars, which also aired on the History Channel, is set in Las Vegas and follows Danny \\"The Count\\" Koker, who owns Count's Kustoms, an automobile restoration and customization workshop. The show highlights Koker and his team as they work on various projects, including the restoration and customization of classic automobiles, motorcycles, and other unique vehicles. Featuring fascinating stories and colorful characters, the series showcases the artistic, technical, and historical aspects of vehicle restoration. While American Restoration focused on a broader range of items, such as gas pumps, soda machines, vending machines, and more, Counting Cars takes a more specialized approach by concentrating mainly on the restoration and customization of vehicles. Both shows provide viewers with an in-depth look into the craftsmanship, challenges, and triumphs that come with the restoration process and highlight the dedication and expertise of the people involved in these projects. In conclusion, Counting Cars is a spinoff similar to American Restoration as they both share themes of restoration, teamwork, and a fascination with preserving and reviving the history of collectibles. While American Restoration was centered around Rick's Restorations and a wide variety of items, Counting Cars focuses on Count's Kustoms and caters to automobile and motorcycle enthusiasts.

Article: Buying a house for most of the people is a once in a lifetime decision, which means people decide to do so only after coming across the ideal house. Surprisingly, eight in every 10 home buyers are unhappy with their houses. A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumers' Association (BCA) recently shows about 80 percent of the 2,315 respondents in 23 residential complexes of Beijing are dissatisfied with the soaring house prices. They think the reasonable price in Beijing should be between 3,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan per square meter. The quality of the buildings, the surrounding environment and traffic and property management are the other factors that play a role in people's decision to buy a house. The BCA has suggested strict sales regulations and contracts to ease house-owners' sufferings. It has urged the authorities to impose severe punishment on developers found violating building and other rules and joining hands with others to bid up property prices, About 41.2 percent of the respondents have complained that their house have defective designs, while nearly 40 percent say the lighting and ventilation are far from satisfactory. The landscapes in the residential areas are a source of unhappiness for 43.2 percent of the respondents, and about one-third say they were \\" \\" into buying \\"third grade\\" house. And more than half are not satisfied with the sport and entertainment facilities in their neighborhood. Property management in the buildings, 56.5 percent of the respondents say, is way below standard compared to the high fee charged by the complexes. 60 percent of the consumers doubt the contents of developers' advertisements, with only 6.3 percent being satisfied. Experts have suggested consumers gather thorough knowledge about a developer and their work before deciding to buy a house from it. They should check the day-light conditions and ventilation in different weather conditions in advance, if possible.

Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. and a hint : Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 Bleecker Street, above the Cafe au Go Go) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met...","completion":"Based on the provided context, the album cover that parodied the Beatles' Sgt.

How many sides does a hendecagon have?","completion":"A hendecagon, also known as an undecagon, is a polygon with eleven sides and eleven vertices. This geometrical shape derives its name from the Greek words \\"hendeca\\" or \\"undeca,\\" which mean eleven, and \\"gonia,\\" meaning angle. Consequently, a hendecagon consists of eleven angles as well. In a regular hendecagon, all the sides and angles are congruent, meaning they have the same length and degree measure, respectively. To find the sum of the interior angles of a hendecagon, one can use the formula: Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180° where n represents the number of sides in the polygon. For an hendecagon, n = 11: Sum of interior angles = (11 - 2) × 180° = 9 × 180° = 1,620° Each individual angle within a regular hendecagon can be determined by dividing the sum of the interior angles by the number of angles: Each individual angle = Sum of interior angles / 11 = 1,620° / 11 ≈ 147.27° In real-world applications, hendecagons can be seen in specific geometric designs, architecture, and art. Though less commonly used than polygons with fewer sides, the hendecagon still contributes to the diversity of shapes in various fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Hugo Gye. PUBLISHED:. 10:10 EST, 13 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 07:43 EST, 14 December 2012. Jailed: Wlodzimierz Umaniec has been sentenced to two years in prison for vandalising a Rothko painting. The self-proclaimed artist who vandalised a Mark Rothko painting in what he said was an act of 'yellowism' was today sentenced to two years in prison. Wlodzimierz Umaniec, 26, also known as Vladimir Umanets, defaced the mural, worth around £5million to £9million, at the Tate Modern gallery on October 7. He has said he carried out the crime in an attempt to spread the principles of the obscure artistic movement which he helped create. Umaniec, a Polish national living in. Worthing, West Sussex, admitted criminal damage to the value of in. excess of £5,000 - but estimates suggest the restoration of the painting. will cost around £200,000. The. vandal stepped over a barrier in the art gallery and daubed his name. and the words 'a potential piece of yellowism' before fleeing. The. court heard that he went to the gallery intending to put his. 'signature' on a picture, but decided to damage the Rothko painting only. in the moment he saw it on display. The gallery was then put into 'operation shutdown' with people prevented from leaving or entering the building. Umaniec. has argued that his actions were themselves a work of art, as the rules. of 'yellowism' dictate that anything can be an example of the genre as. long as it is endorsed by a member of the movement. But. judge Roger Chapple said of 'yellowism' that it was 'wholly and utterly. unacceptable to promote it by damaging a work of art' which he called a. 'gift to the nation'. Art? Umaniec claimed that his vandalism was in itself a powerful artistic statement. Speaking. at Inner London Crown Court, he told Umaniec: 'Your actions on the 7th. of October of this year were entirely deliberate, planned and. intentional.' He said. it was 'abundantly clear' that Umaniec was 'plainly an intelligent man' and told the court he had described Rothko as a 'great painter' in a. letter he had written to him. The judge also said the incident had led to galleries reviewing security arrangements at a cost to themselves and the taxpayer. 'The effects of such security reviews is to distance the public from the works of art they come to enjoy,' he said. Supporter: Umaniec was accompanied by Ben Smith, who attempted to explain the principles of 'yellowism' Gregor McKinley, prosecuting, said: 'The work required to restore this picture will be complex and lengthy. 'Complications to this work include the unique painting technique used by the artist and the fact the ink used by Mr Umaniec has permeated the paint layers and the canvas itself.' Mr McKinley said work to restore the painting will take about 20 months and cost 'something around £200,000'. Paintings by Russian-born artist Rothko often fetch tens of millions of pounds. Earlier this year, his Orange, Red, Yellow sold in New York for £53.8million - the highest price paid for a piece of post-War art at auction. The defaced painting, called Black On Maroon, was donated to the Tate in 1969 by Rothko himself. Outside court before the sentencing, Ben Smith, who called himself a 'yellowist', attempted to explain the concept: 'Everything is equal. Everything is art. Everything is a potential piece of yellowism.' After the sentencing, Mr Smith, who had come along to support Umaniec in court, said Umaniec's time in prison would be 'one of the most creative points for him' and will 'give him a greater understanding of humanity'. Speaking about the incident he said: 'This was not an act of destruction. It was an act of creativity. 'Now yellowism is a global phenomenon.' A spokeswoman for the gallery said: 'Tate is pleased that the court has recognised the severity of this incident and its consequences when sentencing Wlodzimierz Umaniec to two years in prison.' What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article is about a man named Wlodzimierz Umaniec, who vandalized a very valuable painting by an artist named Mark Rothko. He said he did it to promote something called \\"yellowism,\\" which is a type of art movement. However, a judge decided that this reason was not acceptable and sentenced him to two years in prison. The damage he caused to the painting is very difficult and expensive to fix, costing around £200,000 and taking about 20 months to complete."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is tended by a nurse, Julie Benson, and they have fallen in love. Corey's military pal, Steve Connolly, arrives in early November to discuss plans for the ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona, they plan to purchase and operate together once Corey is out of the hospital.

By Christmas, Corey is still in recovery but Connolly still remains absent. One night, as Corey lies semi-conscious in bed after being administered a sleeping drug, a woman with a Swedish accent appears at his bedside. She says Connolly has been in a horrible accident; his spine is shattered and he wants to die, but she has refused to help him commit suicide. The woman asks Corey what to do, and he advises her to do nothing to harm Steve, and just to wait. Corey slips into unconsciousness, and the woman disappears. After New Year's Day, Corey is released from the hospital. He is immediately stopped by police detectives and then questioned by Captain Garcia of the Los Angeles Police, who tells him that Connolly is wanted for the murder of Solly Blayne, a local high-stakes gambler and racketeer murdered at his home in Los Feliz.

Title: Incredible Value Review: I've owned Brother Laser printers before, and found the quality of the device and the prints to be quite high.So, I was inclined to give this 5070N a shot when I was looking for a network-enabled printer. The interesting thing about my research was that no other company's network enabled printers came close to the price for this Brother.I had an additional incentive to buy this printer: I'm using Mac OS X and wanted to take advantage of the Rendezvous feature.

The fan and motor are a bit loud for a SOHO setting.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a question: The referee called a foul when one player punched another. The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Here are possible answers to this question: - sporting event - time race - part two boxers - football - hockey game I believe the correct choice is \\"hockey game\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Hockey game\\". There are several reasons that make this the most likely reasoning given the information provided. First, let's discuss the context of the clues given. The context mentions a referee, a foul, a punch, and a penalty box. While several different types of sports games involve referees and fouls, their punishments for such fouls can differ greatly. In the context of a game, a referee's role is to ensure that the rules of the game are followed, and they have the authority to enforce disciplinary action if a player commits a breach of rules or a \\"foul\\". The act of one player punching another is considered a major foul and it is heavily penalized in most sports. However, it does happen in situations of heightened aggression. Usually, in such intense physical contact sports, there exists an space or area to where a player may be sent as consequence for major infractions. This place is known as a \\"penalty box\\". The term \\"penalty box\\" is specific to some sports, most notably ice hockey, which refers to the area where a player who has been charged with a penalty sits to serve the time of the penalty. It's usually a small, box-like area in the rink, set apart from the player's bench. The player sits in the box while the game continues, and the player's team is forced to be shorthanded by one player - a significant disadvantage. Breaking down the answer options: 1. \\"Sporting Event\\" - This is a very broad term and can apply to virtually any type of physical competition. It's not specifically indicative of what exact game is in play. 2. \\"Time Race\\" - There is no mention of speed, tracks, or a finish line, and \\"penalty box\\" is not a terminology found in racing sports. 3. \\"Part Two Boxers\\" - In boxing, there is no penalty box. Also, punching is the objective of the sport, not a foul. 4. \\"Football\\" - Though it often involves fouls and penalties, there is no \\"penalty box\\" in American football. In football (soccer), there is an area referred to as penalty box, but it doesn't function as where a penalized player stays temporarily out of game. Also, punching in football would lead to immediate ejection and not a temporary penalty. 5. \\"Hockey Game\\" - Referees, fouls, players, punches and penalty boxes are all elements present in a hockey game. When a player commits a major infraction, such as punching, they are sent to the \\"penalty box\\" to serve their time. Given all of this information, it can be concluded that the game being referred to is a \\"Hockey game\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This is because Mexico produces 97% of the U.S.'s limes, and most of them are produced in the state of Michoacan. So, the correct answer is \\"Mexico limes at a packing plant in Michoacan,\\" because it matches the information in the passage. The other options are wrong because: - Ashley Collman limes: Ashley Collman is the author of the passage, not a type of lime. - Cal-Mart Grocer limes and Gristedes market limes: These are stores mentioned in the passage where limes are sold, but they are not types of limes or places where limes are produced. - Knights Templar limes: Knights Templar is a drug cartel, not a type of lime. - Michoacan limes: Although Michoacan is the place where most limes are produced, listing it as a type of lime is repetitive in this context since the packing plant is already mentioned to be in Michoacan. - New York limes and San Francisco limes: These are cities in the U.S. where the passage mentions lime prices, but they are not types of limes or places where limes are produced. - U.S. limes: Since the passage says that the U.S. gets 97% of its supply from Mexico, it doesn't make sense to mention U.S. limes in the context of a packing plant in Michoacan, Mexico."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is magnetic field? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"First, let me clarify the two concepts separately. 1. Pulsating magnetic fields: A pulsating magnetic field is a magnetic field that varies with time, usually characterized by a repetitive cycle of increasing and decreasing intensity. These fields can be generated using devices such as electromagnets, which produce magnetic fields by running an alternating current through a coil. Pulsating magnetic fields have applications in various fields like medical treatments, materials processing, and wireless power transmission. 2. Magnetic field: A magnetic field is a vector field that represents the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic materials. The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the direction of the force a moving charge would experience due to the field. It is a fundamental phenomenon in physics, electromagnetism being one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Magnetic fields are produced by electric currents or by the magnetic moments of elementary particles, such as electrons. They have numerous applications in our daily lives, including creating the force that allows compasses to work and driving the operation of electric motors and generators. Now, to answer your third question: No, the questions about pulsating magnetic fields and magnetic fields are not the same. While the first question is about a specific type of magnetic field that changes its intensity over time in a repetitive cycle, the second question is about the general concept of a magnetic field, which includes both static (non-changing) and dynamic (changing) magnetic fields.

Six weeks before D-Day, troops gathered in Studland to rehearse the Normandy landings operation of World War Two - including the testing of the amphibious Valentine tanks. \\"They had a canvas screen around the outside and used displacement to float, and their engines were connected to propellers,\\" said David Willey, curator of Bovington's Tank Museum. The tanks came from a need to provide cover for soldiers as they mounted their first attacks on enemy land, he added. Although it is thought seven tanks lie in Studland Bay, only six are mentioned in a diary that documented the exercise.

These seats are managed by the participating industries, which select a specific number of students for admission. They are eligible to receive financial assistance from the industry during their course of study. Additionally, students under this quota are given the opportunity to intern at the partnering companies, which can further enhance their overall hands-on experience and workplace skills.

Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces.[I] Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul.

There are more than 4,000 people of 48 nationalities. However, all of the people live underground! Coober Pedy was established in 1915, following the discovery of opals . The town is sometimes called the \\"opal capital of the world,\\" because it is the largest opal mining area in the world. Due to a desert climate , people came to realize that while working under the ground was easy, living above it was not. The solution was to move underground, by changing old mines into homes and establishing the world's first and most likely, only underground town. As years have gone by, the homes have become bigger. There are now also some hotels for tourists. They come from all over the world just to see this unusual town. Coober Pedy is probably best known for its unique style of underground living.

Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.

The England fly-half added a second penalty after the break but Ireland 10 Johnny Sexton's brace, to add to his first-half kick, levelled matters. Bath scored a penalty try from a scrum, only for Leinster to level through Josh van der Flier's converted try, but a third Ford penalty saw Bath edge home. Bath, who saw last weekend's game against Toulon postponed after the terror attacks in Paris, looked to play with pace and width from the first whistle, unafraid to attack from deep and keen to get their dangerous back three involved whenever possible. But Leinster's defence was superb, with Ben Teo'o making his mark in midfield, and in the end it was the power of the Bath scrum that proved key. They won half a dozen penalties at the scrum to deny Leinster momentum and give Ford the chance to keep the scoreboard ticking over. And it was a mighty shove midway though the second half that prompted referee Jerome Gacres to award the penalty try that looked like being crucial. Three-time champions Leinster rarely looked threatening but Sexton's boot kept them in touch, and when they brought on their replacements the new faces played a major role in levelling the score. They injected pace into the visitors' game and Leinster academy product Van Der Flier ran a beautiful line to slice through the Bath defence, before showing good strength to go over in a double tackle. The visitors then had a chance to take a late lead, but Sexton's 55m penalty attempt fell short and Bath countered from underneath their posts. When they were awarded a scrum midway inside the Leinster half, their fired-up eight again took the Irish side apart. From the resulting penalty, Ford made light of the difficult angle to drill the kick between the posts to secure victory for Bath and condemn Leinster to a second straight defeat. Bath head coach Mike Ford: \\"We showed our inexperience at 16-9 up. We were in control of the game, but we stupidly did things that let them back in. \\"I am pleased we won against a Leinster side full of internationals.

Select from: [A]. heat energy; [B]. survival; [C]. water; [D]. food; [E]. growth; [F]. ideas; [G]. Energy.; [H]. energy; The answer is:","completion":"B. survival. The reason for this is that effective insulation helps an animal maintain its body temperature, which is crucial for its overall well-being. Staying warm directly impacts an animal's survival because it allows them to conserve energy, which can be utilized for other essential life processes, such as finding food, reproduction, and growth. In cold environments, it's vital for animals to maintain their body warmth, and effective insulation acts as a barrier to prevent heat loss. By keeping the warm air close to their bodies, animals can minimize heat loss and maintain an optimal body temperature. This conserves energy that would otherwise be used to generate more heat, ultimately enhancing the animal's chances of survival. If an animal were to lose heat too quickly or fail to conserve its energy, it could suffer from hypothermia, making it more vulnerable to predators and other environmental dangers. Thus, effective insulation is crucial for maintaining an animal's body temperature and, in turn, ensuring its survival."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Looking to secure a playoff berth, the Falcons traveled to Seattle in their last regular-season road game to take on the Seahawks. Seattle took an early lead with a 1-yard TD run by Marshawn Lynch. Atlanta would later respond early in the second quarter with a Matt Ryan 3-yard TD pass to Jason Snelling, with Matt Bryant later adding a 27-yard field goal to take the lead. Seattle tied the game with a 38-yard field goal from Olindo Mare; however, the Falcons took the lead again with a Ryan 24-yard TD pass to Michael Jenkins to close the first half. On the Seahawks' first offensive possession of the second half, Matt Hasselbeck fumbled the football in the end-zone with defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux recovering for a Falcons' touchdown. Atlanta would later add to their lead with a 25-yard Bryant field goal as well as a Ryan 24-yard TD pass to Roddy White. Seattle's only score of the second half came from backup quarterback Charlie Whitehurst with a 1-yard TD rush followed by a successful 2-point conversion with a Whitehurst pass to Ben Obomanu. With the win, Atlanta improved to 12-2. Also, the Falcons secured a playoff berth early in the game due to Philadelphia's victory over the New York Giants. Answer this question based on the article: How many is the difference in the number of yards of the TD run by Lynch and the TD pass to Snelling?","completion":"To determine the difference in the number of yards of the TD run by Lynch and the TD pass to Snelling, we need to compare the yardage of each play. The article states that Marshawn Lynch had a 1-yard TD run, and Matt Ryan had a 3-yard TD pass to Jason Snelling. Now, subtract the yardage of Lynch's run from the yardage of Ryan's pass: 3 yards (Ryan's pass to Snelling) - 1 yard (Lynch's run) = 2 yards The difference in the number of yards of the TD run by Lynch and the TD pass to Snelling is 2 yards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Santana is a Latin music and rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1966 by Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana. The band came to public attention with their performance of \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" at Woodstock in 1969. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by Abraxas and Santana III. Lineup changes were common. The follow-up to Supernatural came three years later and was highly anticipated by international media and fans alike. On October 22, 2002, Shaman was released worldwide. Although it initially sold briskly (298,973 copies in the US in its first week) and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, the album's appeal quickly wore off and it soon slid down the charts. Despite this, it went on to sell 2x platinum in the US, and achieved platinum status in several other countries including Australia. The first single released from the album, \\"The Game of Love\\", which featured vocals from Michelle Branch, debuted at number 5 on the Hot 100. The album's next four singles failed to chart in most countries, but the final single, \\"Why Don't You & I\\", featuring the vocals of Alex Band, reached number 8 on the Hot 100. Musically, the album was a return to a more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound. With their renewed appeal worn off, another three-year wait saw the release of 2005's All That I Am. The album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 but fared worse internationally, and quickly lost appeal. The album, a continuation of the Latin-rock influenced sound of Shaman, achieved gold certification in the US. A five-year break from recording saw the release of another studio album, 2010's Guitar Heaven. Musically it was a drastic change for the band, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong heavy metal influences. It debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 but marked another decline for the band, failing to achieve gold status. In 2012 the group released Shape Shifter, which returned to the conventional Latin rock sound and was completely album-oriented, as no singles were released from it. It debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200.

(2) The album was produced by Mike Leander and \`\` directed '' by Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"While these two sentences appear to be very similar, there are subtle differences in meaning based on the choice of words used to describe the roles of Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest. In the first sentence: \\"The album was produced by Mike Leander and staged by Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest.\\" Here, the word \\"staged\\" is used, which suggests that Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest were responsible for arranging or orchestrating different aspects of the album. This could include coordinating the recording process, managing the studio environment, setting up the equipment, overseeing live performances or other related tasks. It implies that they played a significant role in ensuring that the various elements of the album were well-organized and executed for a successful final product. In the second sentence: \\"The album was produced by Mike Leander and directed by Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest.\\" The use of the word \\"directed\\" implies that the roles of Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest were more focused on creative decision-making and artistic direction. This would involve guiding the development of the album from a creative standpoint, including decisions related to song selection, musical arrangements, recording techniques, and other creative elements. Their role would be more focused on shaping the overall vision of the album and ensuring that the final product meets the standards they set. In summary, while both sentences convey that Mike Leander produced the album, and Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest contributed to its creation, the first sentence emphasizes their roles in organizing and orchestrating the album's production, while the second sentence highlights their involvement in the creative decision-making and artistic direction of the project. Although both roles may have some overlapping responsibilities, the choice of words highlights distinct aspects of the contributions made by Peter Sullivan and Reg Guest."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: The \\"saucy\\" misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in London on the same day in the early 1970s. There's a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese. The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some Carry On-type humour and couple them with various misfits from the British film and TV culture of the time, including Man About the House star Richard O'Sullivan, future Coronation Street rogue Johnny Briggs and horror film stalwart Ferdy Mayne (playing a sheik). There's a pretty risqué amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore). Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she's a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her. These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with, in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives (there's a fine turn by John Standing as an impotent public school roué). The strangest of the stories has the Chinese girl (future cannibal film veteran Me Me Lay) getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer, falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all, except some orientalist notion that \\"Chinese birds are inscrutable, ain't they?!\\" The film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations. The end is striking, as Mayne's sheik for no earthly reason (except they have to end the film somehow) whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade, which they are all delighted about. Stuff and nonsense for the most part then, but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran Val Guest, which puts it as a piece of film-making a notch above most of the 70s Brit sexploitation flicks.","completion":"The sentiment of this description seems to be mostly negative.

The United States, often referred to as the U.S. or America, is a country primarily situated in North America, comprising 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), and several territories. It is the world's third-largest country by size, covering 9.8 million square kilometers, and is home to a diverse population of approximately 331 million people. The United States is characterized by its rich cultural, political, and economic heritage, which lends the country global influence, reputation, and power. As a federal republic, the United States is built upon a system of checks and balances, allowing for the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. The term \\"leader\\" generally refers to a person who holds a position of authority or influence and is responsible for guiding, inspiring, and directing a group of individuals or an organization toward achieving certain objectives. Leaders can emerge in various contexts - from politics, communities, and businesses, to social movements and clubs.

To provide a detailed and long answer, let's break down the information given in the text and elaborate on the context and implications. Dale Earnhardt Jr., a popular and successful professional race car driver in the NASCAR series is the main subject in the text. He is the son of the late Dale Earnhardt Sr., a NASCAR legend and seven-time champion. Continuing in his father's footsteps, Dale Earnhardt Jr. has made a name for himself in the world of NASCAR. The incident described in the text occurred at Darlington, South Carolina. Darlington is home to the historic Darlington Raceway, a prestigious and challenging racetrack built in 1950, known for its distinct egg-shaped design that has earned the nickname, \\"The Track Too Tough To Tame.\\" Due to the prominence and history of the racetrack, the Southern 500 is one of the most anticipated and popular races held at Darlington Raceway. On Friday, during a practice session, Dale Earnhardt Jr. damaged his primary car. Practice sessions are held to allow drivers to get a feel for the track, test out various car setups, and fine-tune their performance before the actual race takes place. Unfortunately, accidents can happen during these sessions as drivers push the limits to find the best setup for the race. As a result of the damage sustained to his primary car, Earnhardt Jr.'s team made the decision to use a backup car for the Southern 500 race on Sunday. In NASCAR, teams typically bring a backup car to each race event in case of incidents like this. Backup cars are designed and built to the same standards as a driver's primary car, but they can require adjustments and fine-tuning to perform at their best. This means Earnhardt Jr.'s team would need to work diligently and quickly to ensure the backup car is optimized for Sunday's race. In summary, this text is about a specific event in the sports world, more precisely in the NASCAR series, where Dale Earnhardt Jr. had an accident during a practice session and is now turning to a backup car for the Southern 500 race. This situation highlights the importance of having a backup car and a well-prepared team in the demanding world of motorsports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - Catwoman (Selina Kyle) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. The character was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, and she made her debut in \\"Batman\\" #1 (Spring 1940), in which she is known as \\"the Cat\\". Catwoman has traditionally been portrayed as a supervillain and adversary of Batman, but since the 1990s, she has been featured in an eponymous series that depicts her as an antiheroine rather than a traditional villain.

During the late 1950s and 1960s superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of the Justice League of America. In the 1990s Modern Age, Aquaman's character became more serious than in most previous interpretations, with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis. - Green Arrow is a fictional superhero who appears in comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Mortimer Weisinger and designed by George Papp, he first appeared in \\"More Fun Comics\\" #73 in November 1941. His real name is Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Queen, a billionaire businessman and owner of Queen Industries, also a well-known celebrity in his locale of Star City. Sometimes shown dressed like Robin Hood, Green Arrow is an archer who uses his skills to fight crime in his home cities of Star City and Seattle, as well as alongside his fellow superheroes as a member of the Justice League. Though much less frequently used in modern stories, he also deploys a range of trick arrows with various special functions, such as glue, explosive-tipped, grappling hook, flash grenade, tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations. At the time of his debut, Green Arrow functioned in many ways as an archery-themed analogue of the very popular Batman character, but writers at DC subsequently developed him into a voice of progressivism very much distinct in character from Batman. - DC Comics, Inc. is an American comic book publisher. It is the publishing unit of DC Entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. , a division of Time Warner.

But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. In all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. On top of that, I don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular \\"A-Team\\" episode.

How is \\"If it is agreed, then we will go for it.\\" said in Romanian?","completion":"The phrase \\"If it is agreed, then we will go for it.\\" can be translated into Romanian as \\"Dacă se ajunge la un acord, atunci vom merge pe varianta aceasta.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Dacă\\" - \\"If\\": This is a conjunction introducing a conditional clause. 2. \\"se ajunge\\" - \\"it is agreed\\": In Romanian, this is an impersonal construction with the verb \\"a ajunge\\" (to arrive, to reach), which takes on the meaning of \\"to agree\\" in this context. The reflexive pronoun \\"se\\" makes the construction impersonal. 3. \\"la un acord\\" - \\"to an agreement\\": This is a common way of expressing agreement in Romanian using the preposition \\"la\\" followed by the indefinite article \\"un\\" and the noun \\"acord,\\" which has the same meaning as the English word \\"agreement.\\" 4. \\"atunci\\" - \\"then\\": This word indicates a consequence or result following a condition, much like \\"then\\" does in English. 5. \\"vom merge\\" - \\"we will go\\": This is the Romanian future tense of the verb \\"a merge\\" (to go); \\"vom merge\\" means \\"we will go\\". 6. \\"pe varianta aceasta\\" - \\"for it\\" or \\"on this option\\": This phrase shows the choice that will be taken if the condition is met. \\"Pe\\" is a preposition meaning \\"on\\" or \\"for,\\" \\"varianta\\" is the noun for \\"option,\\" and \\"aceasta\\" is a demonstrative pronoun meaning \\"this.\\" Together, they can be translated as \\"for this option\\" or simply \\"for it\\" in a more general sense.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The World Health Organization estimates that at least 81 million people across Africa are affected by some form of disability. As a result many grassroots activists, academics and artists are finding innovative ways to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, at both a local and international level. From the Accessible Guidebook to Ethiopia, to wheelchairs made especially for rough rural terrain, there are numerous examples of resourcefulness and audacity. BBC Africa spoke to eight of these change-makers - to find out what they are doing and why they were inspired to make a change. In 2002, singer Grace Jerry was on her way home from choir rehearsal when she was knocked down by a drunk driver and left with paralysis of the lower limbs. After the accident she says music took on a whole new dimension: \\"Today, it is more than just holding the microphone, it is my world, my platform and my voice.\\" Last year, she introduced President Obama at the Mandela Washington Fellowship Young African Leaders Initiative programme in the United States. \\"I had to hold back the tears when he walked up to me on stage and said some beautiful things about me and the work we are doing in Nigeria through [disability advocacy NGO] Inclusive Friends,\\" she remembers. Four years ago, the Ethiopian Center for Disability and Development published its Guide to Accessible Addis Ababa, reviewing the accessibility of different hotels, government buildings, restaurants and public spaces. \\"When we saw that it was really helpful for visitors as well as locals with disabilities, we thought 'Ok we have to scale up this project',\\" says programme director Retta Getachew. \\"We have six guides now and another that combines them all in one book, which is the Guide to Accessible Ethiopia.\\" When her daughter was born with disabilities, Shona McDonald says medical staff told her: \\"'Put her in a home, have another kid and move on' - that there was nothing that would really add value for her. And it was through my frustration and anger that I decided I wanted to prove them wrong.\\" Using her sculpting skills, she started designing mobility equipment and supports - with the help of the University of Cape Town's biomedical-engineering department. Now her company, Shonaquip, manufacturers everything from wheelchairs to posture supports, which can be easily assembled, fitted and maintained by local therapists and technicians all over Africa. Last year, Tlhokomelo Elena Sabole was crowned Miss Deaf Africa 2015. It was, she says, a dream come true: \\"Winning was so amazing. I have never been happy like that.\\" Growing up in Lesotho as a deaf person is not easy, she says. But she hopes to change attitudes towards non-hearing people, and wants to see access to information opened up - such as through sign language on TV and signing classes in schools. \\"My dream is to have my own business,\\" she says, \\"for example a salon where I can share my skills and work with other deaf girls.\\" When Kenneth Habaalu joined the APTERS organisation they were finding it difficult to identify children with disabilities in the community. \\"People didn't want others to know they had a disabled child at home,\\" he explains. \\"One mother told me she usually leaves her child in bed when she goes to the market. To help her sit, she said: 'I dig a hole outside the house and put the child in there.' To stand, she would tie the child to the tree with material. I think it's inhuman to do such things.\\" With limited resources, APTERS' team of eight (all of whom are disabled) use recycled paper and cardboard to make papier machÃ© chairs, standing frames and walking aids, as well as teaching blocks for physiotherapy. Victor Locoro has been working as a lecturer in the Faculty of Special Needs and Rehabilitation at Uganda's Kyambogo University for 20 years. As well as offering courses in community-based rehabilitation and disability studies, the faculty has its own Braille Production Unit. \\"At the moment it's on hold because one of the embosser machines needs serious repair,\\" says Mr Locoro, who lost his sight at the age of ten. \\"But we are able to produce small amounts of material for the students, and are in the process of replacing the machine so that we resume full production. This includes producing books in Braille for primary and secondary schools; ministries of education, science, technology and sports; as well as civil society organisations.\\" In September 2007, Tim Stones co-founded the South African Deaf Rugby Union (SADRU). But there was a problem, the union wasn't affiliated with the South African Rugby Union - and so wasn't recognised by World Rugby. That all changed in 2014, and the following August SADRU held its first official Deaf Rugby Test series - the first of its kind held on South African soil - against Deaf Rugby World Champions, Wales. Today, the union has around 90 deaf players. \\"However our numbers are steadily growing,\\" says Mr Stones, \\"especially now that we are forming provincial Deaf Rugby unions in each province of SA.\\" SADRU is also working with audiologists to conduct screenings in clubs and schools, to identity potential players - and undiagnosed hearing problems. In between studying for her Electrical Engineering Masters at Colombia, Kay Igwe, who was raised in America but whose parents are from Nigeria, has been busy making an accessible computer game that's powered by brain waves. \\"A lot of people are investing in gaming culture right now,\\" she explains, \\"but when someone has a neurodegenerative disease that impairs them from using any of their limbs or eye movements - or if they've suffered from a stroke or something that has left them paralysed - they cannot use a controller in the same way that someone who has those abilities can.\\" Her solution? To use electroencephalogram or EEG signals to connect the brain to a computer game, so that a person can control a player using their brain waves. This is part of BBC Africa's Living With Disability season. Find out more here.","completion":"The World Health Organization says that at least 81 million people in Africa have some sort of disability. So there are people working really hard to make things better and easier for them. They're coming up with things like special wheelchairs and guide books to help those with disabilities. They're even making computer games that you can play with your brain! Just think of them like superheroes, but instead of capes and superpowers, they use their creativity and caring hearts to help others. Like a singer who uses her music to speak for disabled people. Or a mom who wasn't okay with doctors saying her daughter wouldn't do well just because she had disabilities. She made special equipment to help her, and now she's helping many others too! There's even a teacher who helps students by making books in Braille. These people are changing the world one step at a time.

American teenagers sometimes use certain drugs to feel good. They call this \\"getting high\\". The problem is that once a young man or a young woman has the feeling of \\"getting high, they want to do it often. If school is boring or too hard, students might get depressed and a drug or herb might help them feel better. If a student takes too much of a drug, the body may change in a negative way such as a confused mind, poor vision, a headache, and an uncomfortable stomach. School mow have DARE programme which means Drug Abuse Resistance Education. This programme was started so that young students from age 10 to18 might understand how a drug affects their bodies. The main point of the programme is education. Once a student understands certain drugs can cause ill health, he will know he should not use them. Education is the key to good nutrition as well. If a student eats correctly, he or she will be full of energy which leads to good study habits and good grades. Poor nutrition may cause the need for more sleep and poor concentration. Proper food is similar to the proper use of drugs. Both allow a healthy body to grow while misuse prevents a person from developing normally.

A group of police cars, with sirens wailing, escort an ambulance to Los Alamos Memorial Hospital. They are carrying an unidentified 50-year old man with acid burns to the face. He is placed on a respirator because the toxic fumes from the acid have seared his lungs and thus compromised his ability to breathe. A Detective (Elias Koteas) attempts to speak with him, asking him to identify himself and wondering whether he is a part of a Satanic cult. He gets no reply. A nurse calls him to the front desk to take a telephone call from the receptionist in the lobby who reports that the man's daughter is asking about him. Hearing a sudden change in the beeping of his respirator, the nurse returns to the man's room and screams. The man has jumped out of his tenth floor window to his death, leaving only a note that reads: \\"I'm sory [sic] Abby\\".Two weeks earlier. Twelve-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is sitting alone in the snow-covered courtyard of his apartment building, singing to himself, until his mother (Cara Buono) calls him for dinner. Owen's parents are in the process of a nasty divorce, and Owen is often left to eat alone and amuse himself by playing alone in his room. One evening, he notices a girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) about his age and her father (Richard Jenkins) moving into the apartment next door to his. Oddly, she is wearing no shoes.The next day at school, Owen is picked on as usual by three older boys -- Kenny (Dylan Minnette) and his friends Mark (Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak) and Donald (Nicolai Dorian).

She's not very friendly and tells him right off that they can't be friends. Not long afterwards, her father walks through the courtyard. It is revealed to the viewers, and what Owen doesn't know, is that he is not Abby's... A:","completion":"I will try my best to answer your questions regarding the film proposal for \\"Let Me In.\\" 1. \\"Owen travels with what?\\" In the movie, Owen doesn't travel in the traditional sense. However, he frequently spends his time in the snow-covered courtyard of his apartment building, where he eventually meets Abby. If you are referring to what he carries with him, he has a knife that he uses to practice self-defense against his bullies. 2. Movie Title: \\"Let Me In.\\" This title appears to be a reference to the relationship between Owen and Abby. At the beginning of their interactions, Abby is not very friendly towards Owen, even telling him that they can't be friends. However, as the story unfolds, Abby \\"lets Owen in\\" and they develop a close relationship, while dealing with their respective issues and mysteries surrounding Abby and her father. 3. Movie Plot: \\"Let Me In\\" follows the story of Owen, a 12-year-old boy who is often bullied at school and feels lonely due to his parents' divorcing. Abby, a mysterious girl around his age, moves in with her father next door to Owen's apartment, and despite an initially cold attitude, they eventually become closer. Abby is revealed to be a vampire. Her \\"father\\" commits murders to provide her with fresh human blood to survive. As their bond grows stronger, Owen learns more about Abby's secret. Meanwhile, Abby's \\"father\\" dies after a failed murder attempt, which leads to the involvement of the authorities. The movie also shows violence and retaliation, as Owen finds courage in standing up to his bullies with Abby's help, which reaches a pivotal moment in a climactic swimming pool scene, where Abby saves Owen from his tormentors. At the end of the film, Abby and Owen decide to leave the town together, setting the stage for their uncertain future. Owen hides Abby in a box while traveling by train, suggesting that he has taken over the \\"caretaker\\" role from Abby's deceased father figure. Overall, the movie combines elements of horror, coming-of-age story, and drama, focusing on the developing relationship between Owen and Abby amidst both supernatural and more conventional life challenges. In order to decide whether to invest in this film proposal, you should consider factors such as the target audience, the expected financial return, the potential for critical success, and your belief in the team handling the movie's production.

The park is about 30 miles (48 km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19 km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6 km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km).I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42 km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.The fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 km2). The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The park’s elevation above sea level varies from a low of 5,340 feet (1,630 m) along the Puerco River to a high of 6,230 feet (1,900 m) at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about 5,400 feet (1,600 m). The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north. Most of the park's intermittent streams—including Lithodendron Wash, Dead Wash, Ninemile Wash, and Dry Wash—empty into the Puerco River.

A: A:","completion":"The skin has two main layers: the epidermis and the dermis. 1. Epidermis: The outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis provides the body's primary barrier against the environment. Composed mainly of keratinocytes (skin cells that produce the protein keratin), it also contains other cell types, such as melanocytes (cells producing melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color), Langerhans cells (immune response cells), and Merkel cells (touch receptor cells). The epidermis is further divided into several sublayers, including the stratum corneum (the outermost sublayer), stratum lucidum (thin translucent layer, present in palms and soles), stratum granulosum (containing cells with granules), stratum spinosum (spiny layer with cells bridged by desmosomes), and the stratum basale (the deepest sublayer, where new cells are produced). 2. Dermis: The dermis, located beneath the epidermis, is a thicker layer of connective tissue that provides support and structure to the skin. It contains fibroblasts (cells producing collagen and elastin fibers), blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands (oil glands). The dermis can be further divided into two sublayers: the papillary dermis, which is the thinner, upper layer containing fine collagen and elastin fibers and dermal papillae (finger-like projections that interlock with the epidermis); and the reticular dermis, which is the deeper and thicker layer containing denser collagen and elastin fibers, as well as the majority of skin appendages (such as hair follicles and sweat glands). These two layers work together to protect the body from environmental factors, enable perspiration and temperature regulation, and provide sensation and elasticity to the skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

FEC Back in October, we wrote an explainer on McCutcheon v. FEC, the case of aggregate donor giving on which the Supreme Court ruled today. We're reposting it here. And you can read the full McCutcheon ruling here. So what's this case all about? Shaun McCutcheon is a conservative businessman from Alabama who likes to give money to political candidates and committees. He dished out thousands of dollars in donations last election cycle. He says he would have given more, if not for the law that says an individual can only donate a certain total amount each cycle to candidates and certain political committees. McCutcheon thinks the law is a violation of the First Amendment. The Republican National Committee, which joined McCutcheon in the case, agrees. From the perspective of the Federal Election Commission and those who favor tighter campaign finance restrictions, the limits are necessary to fight corruption. The Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg ) How much can individuals give under the current law? For the 2013-2014 cycle, individuals can give a total of 123,200 to candidates, national party committees and certain political committees, including a 48,600 limit on what individuals can give to candidates. There are also other limits. For example, an individual can only give 2,600 to a specific candidate for federal office, per election per cycle. While this case is focused on the aggregate limits, it's important keep all the limits in mind. (More on that in a moment.) (Chart via FEC Web site.) Why do these limits exist, anyway? Because of changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1974 that instituted them and created the FEC, the body that oversees and enforces campaign finance regulations. The act was amended in the wake of violations in the Watergate scandal. President Richard Nixon speaks near Orlando, Fla. to the Associated Press Managing Editors annual meeting, Nov. 17, 1973. Nixon told the APME \\"I am not a crook.\\" (Associated Press) So if the aggregate limits are struck down, what will it mean? A couple of things. For one thing, wealthy donors who can afford to make many donations will have greater influence when it comes to donating to candidates directly. Under the current aggregate limit of 48,600, an individual can max out at 18 federal candidates per cycle. Think of how much more they could give in total if they maxed out at 50 candidates -- or even more. Secondly, as The Washington Post's Robert Barnes and Matea Gold explain, defenders of the limits worry that such a ruling could dramatically increase the power and size of joint fundraising committees, which harness the fundraising power of different political committees. For example, the Obama Victory Fund joined together the DNC and Obama campaign last election cycle. In addition, those who favor limits also worry that such a ruling could lead to doing away with all limits, including the individual limits mentioned above. It's worth noting that in the current environment, there are already entities called super PACs that are not subject to limits on how much money they can accept from donors. So what is the court going to decide? It's not clear. But it looks like Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. will be key in this case. It's less clear where they will come down, compared to the other conservatives justices, write Barnes and Gold. Chief Justice John Roberts.

Movie title: Thelma & Louise Movie plot: As the film opens, we meet Louise (Susan Sarandon), a waitress in a diner-style restaurant. She phones her friend Thelma (Geena Davis) and makes reference to a vacation they are about to take together where they will retreat to a friend's rural cabin for the weekend. Thelma is married to a moronic hothead named Darryl (Christopher McDonald), and she is too timid to even tell Darryl that she is going away for the weekend. Instead, she waits until Darryl leaves for work and then writes a note. Louise is unmarried, although she does have a boyfriend named Jimmy (Michael Madsen). Her relationship is not the type that she has to explain anything to Jimmy; it is clear that Louise is an independent and headstrong woman, while Thelma is passive and naive. Perhaps out of fear of being in the woods with no man around, Thelma brings along Darryl's handgun. Together, the two friends set out in Louise's 1966 Thunderbird convertible.Before they have reached their destination, Thelma wants to stop at a roadhouse and have a few drinks. Although Louise does not want to do this, she warily agrees, seeing as it is Thelma's vacation, too. While there, the two women meet a man named Harlan (Timothy Carhart), who takes an interest in Thelma and flirts with her all evening. After Thelma has had too much to drink, Harlan sneaks her away from Louise and takes her out to the dark parking lot, where he attempts to have sex with her. When Thelma protests, Harlan becomes violent and attempts to rape her. He is interrupted by Louise, who appears brandishing the gun. Harlan tries to explain that they were just having fun, Louise warns him that when a woman protests a man's sexual advances, \\"she isn't having any fun.\\" Although she is able to get Thelma safely away from Harlan, he claims that he wishes he had raped Thelma after all, and Louise immediately shoots him dead.

Context: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

In this confessional age, TV, radio and print rely for much of their content on the sad stories of those 'victims' of life. The story goes something like this: There is the future 'victim' getting on with their quotidian activities and whoosh, they are whisked into a life of gambling, drugs, sex or junk food addiction. After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails. Take your pick: they were molested, their parents ran away from home, they were denied desserts except on Sundays. Just thinking about it brings a tear to my stony face. How can you not be moved by tales such as these. What is the precipitating cause of the misery in my life? Well, my mother was French and my father was English.

I was fortunate enough to be sent to the English side of the school and got to speak my native tongue. My parents decided my brother and sister wouldn't be quite so lucky. In an effort to bridge the great language divide, they both spent six years learning everything in French and mingling with the French people (My parents did this because it was the firm belief of all forward-thinking families that whatever road you took would be much smoother if you could speak both of Canada's official languages.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Children are known to be very keen observers and once they are interested in something, it is very likely to stay with them for life. They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement. Because they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire. One reason why children keep changing their answers to \\"what would you like to be when you grow up\\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field. Children view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook. According to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them. Of course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life. They find it easier to deal with the highs and lows of life because they have seen their parents do it before. They find a sense of stability and security knowing that they will overcome failures just like their parents before them. Besides, it becomes easier for parents to discipline and guide children. So it is no wonder why children who have parents as their role models have fewer behavioral issues. Question: According to the study, after direct contact with their role models, _ . - there is a decrease in children's self-esteem - there are fewer children better at academics - children may have a strong desire to succeed - children may feel more optimistic about their future The answer to this question is:","completion":"- children may feel more optimistic about their future"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eventually learned the truth about his illness after watching TLC's reality show The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum about Wesley Warren Jr. Urologist Joel Gelman, who operated on Warren last year, agreed to perform surgery on Mr Maurer.

Article:","completion":"Title: Man with Rare Condition Gets Help After Watching a TV Show Once upon a time, there was a man named Dan Maurer who was 39 years old. He had a very rare condition called scrotal lymphedema. This condition caused his scrotum to grow bigger and bigger over time, which made it really hard for Dan to do everyday things like walk, sit, or even lie down. Dan first noticed something was wrong when he was in his 20s. His scrotum started to get bigger, but when he went to the doctors, they kept telling him he just needed to lose weight. Even though Dan tried really hard to lose weight, his scrotum kept getting bigger and bigger. One day, Dan was watching a TV show on a channel called TLC. The show was about a man named Wesley Warren Jr., who had the same big-scrotum problem as Dan. From the show, Dan learned the name of his condition - scrotal lymphedema - and he realized that losing weight wouldn't fix his problem. Dan was very lucky because a really smart doctor named Dr. Joel Gelman had helped Wesley Warren Jr. by doing a special surgery to make his scrotum smaller. Dan thought that maybe Dr. Gelman could help him too. So, he contacted Dr. Gelman, and the kind doctor agreed to do the same surgery for Dan. Dr. Gelman and his team worked very hard for 14 hours to complete the surgery. Dan's family was so happy because the operation was a success! They called it a \\"miracle\\" and thanked the doctor for helping Dan. Now that the surgery is over, Dan will return home soon. He can't wait to play with his friends, go on adventures, and do all the things he missed out on because of his big scrotum. And it's all thanks to the brave doctor and a TV show that helped Dan learn the truth about his illness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It can greatly reduce the quality of life of those who suffer from it, often limiting their mobility and causing discomfort during daily activities. Helping someone with arthritis aims to alleviate their symptoms and improve their overall well-being. Here are some reasons why someone might want to help their arthritis: 1) To reduce pain: Arthritis can cause chronic pain, which can be debilitating and interfere with a person's ability to participate in everyday activities. By helping to manage arthritis, one can lessen the pain they experience, providing relief and enabling them to carry out their daily tasks with greater ease. 2) To increase mobility: Joint stiffness and swelling are common symptoms of arthritis, which can limit a person's range of motion. Helping with arthritis may improve joint flexibility and range of motion, allowing sufferers to move with less difficulty and discomfort. 3) To maintain or regain independence: People with arthritis may find it difficult to perform essential functions such as self-care, household chores, or even work-related tasks. Assisting in managing arthritis symptoms can help a person maintain their independence or regain lost abilities. 4) To improve overall quality of life: Reducing the limitations caused by arthritis can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life. Helping their arthritis may enable them to participate in hobbies or activities they once enjoyed but have been unable to partake in due to pain or stiffness. 5) To prevent or slow the progression: Taking steps to alleviate arthritis symptoms and address the underlying factors contributing to the condition may help prevent the arthritis from getting worse or could even slow its progression. In the context given, it appears that the individual was assisting with their dog's arthritis, hoping it might help them return to participating in agility events. While it's not one of the options mentioned, it could be considered a part of improving their dog's overall quality of life by allowing them to enjoy and partake in an activity they previously enjoyed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I've seen the Gator Bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them. The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones (although not very far) is that the sexual content is not glorified. There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy. Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge. This is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers. I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral, but I was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead, it was not meant to pass off as a T&A film. B-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B-movie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity does not drive the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless B-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it simply satisfies the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve. The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks. Oddly, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (although not by much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller, staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord), but again, this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with. (spoilers) You know that this is all the movie means to do, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. The woman does not live happily ever after, she doesn't write her book, she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place, she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks. But hey, what more did you expect? Oh, and did you read the tagline? If you decide to waste your time watching this, try and find any man getting broken or burned.

For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \\"intercostal clavicle\\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course when she plays his ball. She is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained young lady unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents. Susan's brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. Its tameness is helped by hearing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\". Susan thinks David is a zoologist, and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage. David's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee.

If you catch yourself having sweet cravings on a regular basis, find healthy swaps to help you limit your overall sugar consumption. Find some healthy swaps to help keep your diet more nutritious and moderate in calories. Eating a higher calorie sweet treat on a regular or daily basis may be too many calories for you. This could cause you to gain too much weight during your pregnancy. Go for fruit. If you're craving something sweet after a meal, try settling that craving with a sweet piece of fruit. Make sure to choose ripe fruit that has a sweet flavor. Try: bananas, pineapple, mango, peaches or berries. Have a cup of tea. Another trick to satisfy a sweet craving is by having a cup of hot tea. Pick a flavorful brand with natural sweetness - like orange cinnamon or chai - and add a drop or two of honey or agave syrup. Have some yogurt. Stock up on some of your favorite yogurt flavors. These are naturally sweet and with some added fruit, this can really satisfy your sweet tooth. Another way to manage your sweet cravings is by adding something sweet to your meals. Tasting sweets during your meal can help decrease the desire to end your meal with a treat. Try: Adding sliced fruit or dried fruit on a salad. Fruit pairs well with many lettuces and dressings and can add a sweet bite to your fresh salads. End your lunch with a piece of fruit. Pack a piece of fruit with your lunch and eat this last. Whether its a few grapes, a sliced apple or a fruit cup, ending your meal by eating your serving of fruit last leaves the sweet flavor in your mouth. Although pregnancy cravings are common, they are not a sign that you need any nutrients or specific foods. Work on moving past and ignoring some of your cravings so that you can stick to your definition of moderation. If you're having a very strong craving and can't move past it, indulge yourself. However, if it's not an overly strong craving or you know you just had a small bowl of ice cream last night, consider moving past your craving. Try going for a short walk. A little exercise is a great way to get your mind and eyes off of sweets that may be hanging around your house. Walk for 10-15 minutes at a time and revisit your craving when you get home. Try calling a friend or family member to help distract you mentally from your craving. You can also ask them to be your support and help you stick to your definition of moderation. If you have a baby on the way, there are probably plenty of things you can be doing around the house to get you, your family and your home ready for the new baby. Distract yourself by going shopping for things you may need, looking online for a crib, or planning out your new nursery. If you're having significant sweet cravings, it can be difficult to manage them or stick to your definition of moderation if your pantry, refrigerator and freezer are full of sweets. Limit how much you keep in your house so you're not so tempted. If you notice that your cravings are getting worse or you're having difficulty managing them, consider cleaning out your kitchen to help you avoid overdoing it. First consider getting rid of highly processed processed sweets or those that are overly high in calories or fat. Items like snack cakes, candy or fruit treats do not offer many health benefits and are overly processed. Keep some of those healthier snacks or sweets on hand. Stock your kitchen with dark chocolate bars, fruit, or some of your homemade treats (like frozen, chocolate dipped bananas).","completion":"This article provides tips on managing sweet cravings during pregnancy, such as making healthier swaps, adding sweet elements to meals, practicing moderation, engaging in physical and mental distractions, and maintaining a kitchen free of excessive temptations."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group...

An integer is what sort of number????","completion":"An integer is a type of number that belongs to the mathematical set of numbers that includes both positive and negative whole numbers, as well as zero. Integers can be represented on the number line and are a crucial component of fundamental mathematical concepts and operations. Integers can be classified into different categories based on their properties: 1. Positive Integers: These are the whole numbers greater than zero (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4,…). They are represented to the right of zero on the number line. 2. Negative Integers: These are the whole numbers less than zero (e.g., -1, -2, -3, -4,…). They are represented to the left of zero on the number line. 3. Zero: This is a neutral integer, neither positive nor negative. It serves as the dividing point between positive and negative integers on the number line. Integers are commonly used in various mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When performing these operations with integers, certain rules need to be followed to ensure accurate results. These rules include: 1. Addition: - Adding two positive integers results in a positive integer. - Adding two negative integers results in a negative integer. - Adding a positive integer to a negative integer (or vice versa) involves finding the difference between their absolute values, and the result takes the sign of the integer with the larger absolute value. 2. Subtraction: - Subtracting an integer is the same as adding its opposite. For example, subtracting a positive integer is equivalent to adding its negative counterpart, and vice versa. 3. Multiplication and Division: - Multiplying or dividing two positive integers results in a positive integer. - Multiplying or dividing two negative integers also results in a positive integer. - Multiplying or dividing a positive integer by a negative integer (or vice versa) results in a negative integer. Integers are foundational elements in mathematics and are vital for understanding various mathematical concepts, such as number theory, algebra, and geometry. They are also used in practical applications, involving finance, the sciences, and even day-to-day life situations like counting objects, measuring temperature, or calculating a gain/loss.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: It's bad enough to be sick and miserable. But adding insult to injury for many a patient is having to hack through a veritable jungle of often-confusing paperwork to make health insurance claims. Dr. Val Jones is part of a practice in Virginia that has lowered its fees and quit taking insurance. Consumers' frustrations with health insurance paperwork are well-known. But it's also a frustrating tangle for doctors and their staffs. AC360° correspondent Tom Foreman has a report about one innovative practice that has decided to take on the insurance paperwork monster -- by completely avoiding it. Dr. Val Jones joined a small practice, DocTalker Family Medicine in Vienna, Virginia, where the doctors do not even take insurance. They charge a simple, relatively low fee for each service. That's it. The doctors at DocTalker grew tired of seeing patients struggle with baffling insurance paperwork while both their health and wealth were on the line. \\"They don't know why they're getting these questions asked,\\" Jones said. \\"They don't know what the forms mean. And ... their compensation is dependent on it.\\" This innovation has been good news for Carol \\"Yogi\\" Yogan of McClain, Virginia. She said she broke her wrist ice skating, and her insurance company initially told her that her injury would not be covered. After persistent effort, she eventually convinced them otherwise. The company paid. But Yogan is certain without her dogged efforts, her claim would have been forever lost in the \\"paperwork jungle\\" of the insurance trade. Watch Yogan's struggle with bureaucratic red tape ». Yogi Yogan has pretty much lost all faith in insurance companies. She has enough insurance to cover a catastrophic illness, but for routine care, she's now going to that nearby fee-for-service medical office where Jones works. \\"It's seamless,\\" Yogan said. She knows precisely what she is getting and what it costs. Jones does not believe the insurance industry set out to cultivate the paperwork jungle. She thinks it just grew over time. But now that it is there, she suspects they are making so much money off of it, that there is no real incentive to clear it up. Former insurance industry executive Wendell Potter agrees. He said one way insurers make money is by allowing confusion to reign. \\"And people often just give up,\\" Potter said, \\"and don't pursue payment when a claim has been denied or been paid inappropriately or not adequately. And the same is true with doctors and hospitals.\\" He believes billions of dollars are at stake. The insurance industry, while acknowledging the existence of the paperwork jungle, denies it is a trap for extra profits. Robert Zirkilbach is with a national trade association for insurers called America's Health Insurance Plans. \\"The health insurance industry is one of the most regulated industries in America, and particularly at the state level there are all kinds of requirements of information that needs to be provided to patients in paper and through the mail,\\" Zirkilbach said. But he adds, insurers are just as worried as customers about the confusion that causes. \\"We agree that reform is needed. In fact, that's why we've been working very hard to develop reforms to make the system more efficient,\\" Zirkilbach said. AC360° correspondent Tom Foreman contributed to this report.

In the night, Valjean, interrupted by Myriel while stealing his silverware, strikes him and flees. When the police arrest Valjean for stealing and drag him back to Myriel, Myriel tells them that the silverware was a gift and scolds Valjean for forgetting to take his candlesticks as well. Myriel then reminds Valjean that he is to become a new man. Nine years later, Valjean is now a wealthy industrialist and a mayor. Fantine, a single mother working at one of Valjean's factories, is fired from when her manager learns she has had a daughter out of wedlock. However, Valjean is preoccupied with the arrival of Inspector Javert, who previously served as a guard at the prison in which Valjean was held. Fantine, in desperate need of money to pay the extortionate demands of the ThÃ©nardiers for looking after her daughter Cosette, turns to prostitution. Javert starts to suspect that the Mayor and Valjean are the same person. Fantine is attacked by some customers, and when she retaliates, Javert beats and arrests her, planning on sending her to prison. Citing his authority to do so as mayor, Valjean insists on her release and she is let go. Valjean nurses Fantine back to health, and promises her that she will have her daughter back. However, the ThÃ©nardiers continue to extort more money from Valjean and Fantine on the pretence of Fantine's daughter being ill.

A: On the NES, these special controllers were generally connected to one of the two control ports on the front of the console. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: The answer provided is a brief explanation of how the special controllers were connected to the NES. However, a more detailed answer would provide more information about the control ports, types of special controllers, and how they functioned with the NES. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) featured two controller ports on the front of the console, allowing for the connection of standard controllers as well as various special controllers. The standard controllers were rectangular with a directional pad (D-pad), four face buttons (A, B, Start, and Select), and two shoulder buttons (L and R). In addition to the standard controllers, there were several special controllers and peripherals that gamers could use to enhance their gaming experience. These special controllers were connected through the same control ports used for the standard controllers on the front of the NES console. The controllers used a 7-pin connector cable that allows communication between the controller and the console by transferring data in the form of electrical signals. Some of the most notable special controllers for the NES include: 1. Zapper: The NES Zapper is a light gun that players could use for various shooting games like Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley. Gamers would point the Zapper at the screen and pull the trigger to shoot, and the console would detect where the Zapper was aiming based on the light emitted by the television screen. 2. R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy): R.O.B. is a robot accessory designed to interact with certain games, acting as a second player. It responded to specific patterns of screen flashes, and it could manipulate a controller or other physical objects through various attachments. 3. Power Pad: The Power Pad (also known as the Family Trainer in Japan) is a floor mat with twelve pressure-sensitive input buttons designed for exercise and sports-themed games. Players could run, jump, or step on the Power Pad to input commands for games like World Class Track Meet or Dance Aerobics. 4. NES Advantage: The NES Advantage is an arcade-style joystick controller for the NES that provided players with features such as turbo and adjustable rapid-fire capabilities, useful for shooting and fighting games. 5. NES Max: Similar to the Advantage, the NES Max is a controller designed for rapid and precise button inputs. It replaced the D-pad with a \\"circular pad\\" that allowed more fluid input and gave players turbo functionality on A and B buttons. To use any of these special controllers, players would simply need to connect the 7-pin connector cable to one of the available control ports on the front of the NES console. Once connected, the console would detect the peripheral, and the games would respond according to the inputs made on the special controller. In conclusion, the special controllers for the NES were connected to the console using the two control ports available on the front of the system. These controllers worked alongside the standard controllers to provide a more immersive gaming experience with unique gameplay mechanics. Each special controller had its own distinctive features and capabilities, further enhancing the versatility of the Nintendo Entertainment System."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna, Sanskrit ध्यान dhyāna), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight (vipassanā) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight. Question: What is the term when the mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight?","completion":"The term used when the mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight is \\"Vipassanā\\" (Pali) or \\"Vipaśyanā\\" (Sanskrit). It refers to a profound and transformative meditative practice that involves keen observation, contemplation, and deep understanding of the ultimate nature of reality. Vipassanā meditation, also known as \\"insight meditation,\\" is an essential component of the Buddhist path to liberation from suffering, ignorance, and the cycle of rebirth (samsara). The process of achieving Vipassanā begins with the cultivation of mindfulness and mental concentration through various meditative practices, such as shamatha or calming meditation, loving-kindness (metta) meditation, and mindfulness of breathing (anapanasati). As the practitioner gains in concentration, the mind becomes more stable, focused, and less distracted by thoughts and emotions. Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration, called jhāna (Pali, Sanskrit ध्यान dhyāna), their mind is considered to be ripe or ready for the development of insight. In this state, the mind is not only focused but also equanimous, serene, and free from the five hindrances: sensual desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt. The elimination of these hindrances can create the ideal conditions for Vipassanā meditation. During Vipassanā meditation, the practitioner carefully observes and investigates various aspects of their experience, such as bodily sensations, feelings, mental states, and phenomena. They gain a clear and direct understanding of the three universal marks of existence, namely impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness or suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatta). By intuitively comprehending these truths through direct experience, the meditator gradually dismantles the delusion of a separate and permanent self, which lies at the root of suffering and ignorance. As the practitioner's insight deepens, they acquire wisdom (pañña) and develop the ability to cut through defilements (kleshas) such as craving, aversion, and ignorance. This progressive process of inner transformation can culminate in the attainment of various stages of enlightenment (magga), eventually leading to Nirvana, the ultimate liberation from suffering and the unconditioned state of ultimate reality. In conclusion, Vipassanā is the term used when the mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight into the ultimate nature of reality. It is achieved through the prior cultivation of a strong and powerful concentration (jhāna) and is a crucial aspect of the path towards liberation and the end of suffering in Buddhist practice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. While moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side-effects.

The Arches board said there was \\"no other choice\\" after Glasgow Licensing Board's decision hit revenue by over 50%, making the business \\"untenable\\". The licensing board imposed a midnight closing time after police complaints about drug and alcohol incidents. The move was opposed by almost 40,000 people in an online petition and 400 arts figures in a letter of protest. A statement from the Arches said: \\"Following a meeting of The Arches board of directors, and having taken due legal advice, the decision was taken today to start the process of appointing administrators for both Arches Theatre and Arches Retail Company Limited. \\"This follows last month's decision by the Glasgow Licensing Board to curtail the licensed hours of the leading multi-arts venue, effectively preventing the organisation from continuing its very successful and popular programme of club nights. \\"Without the income generated by this strand of activity, which generated over 50% of the companies' annual turnover, The Arches' business model is untenable.\\" The nightclub's licence was restricted to midnight by the licensing board. It had previously been allowed to stay open until 03:00. Gordon Kennedy, chairman of the board of directors, said the decision was taken with \\"deep regret\\", but said they had been left with \\"no other choice\\". Mr Kennedy also thanked those who had supported the campaign to reinstate the venue's licence, and said he had been \\"humbled by the hundreds of artists and industry professionals from all disciplines who have lent their signature and their voice to the cause\\". He continued: \\"Our hope is that the administrators, working with partners and stakeholders, can salvage some of the activities for which The Arches is renowned.\\" The company's executive director Mark Anderson added: \\"We would like to gratefully acknowledge the invaluable contributions made by all staff, board, artists and partners over the years. \\"We offer heartfelt thanks to our loyal customers who supported us throughout the years and were instrumental in making The Arches the iconic venue that it will always remain.\\" A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: \\"We have been working with the Arches and other funders for some time to develop a sustainable model to provide a long term financial solution for the Arches to continue to operate. \\"We remain committed to trying to identify opportunities for their work to go on.\\" Meanwhile a spokesman for Glasgow City Council's licensing board said the decision had come following evidence of \\"over 200 drug-related incidents detailed at the most recent hearing, as well as numerous call-outs to the ambulance service, which often related to people in life threatening situations\\". A statement from the board said: \\"The continued operation of the Arches' late-hours licence threatened public safety, created a risk of crime and endangered the health of individuals. \\"Unfortunately the conditions the Arches agreed to following the death of one of their customers did not curtail problems at the venue and the board had no option but to take further action. \\"The financial situation of a premises can never be a factor in the decision making process of the board.\\" Chief Supt Andy Bates, Police Scotland's divisional commander for Greater Glasgow, said: \\"Our primary role was to protect and ensure public safety and in our view the frequency and volume of incidents that were occurring at the Arches nightclub would have resulted in fatal consequences had we not acted. \\"We remain committed to supporting and working with the licensing industry across Glasgow and Scotland to ensure a safe environment for the public.\\" On its website, the company said that all events scheduled at the Arches from Wednesday onwards would now be cancelled. Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie said the loss of the venue was \\"entirely avoidable\\". \\"I'm disappointed that the city council decided to force The Arches into this position, and I'm surprised that despite the wave of public support not one other Glasgow MSP saw fit to support my call for a rethink. \\"It remains open to Glasgow, to the Scottish government, and to the arts community to try and find a new life for this important venue.\\" Last month, more than 400 cultural figures - including Makar Liz Lochhead, novelist Irvine Welsh and members of Mogwai, Belle & Sebastian and Franz Ferdinand - signed a letter criticising the licensing board's decision. The letter stated: \\"The Arches' importance to the future of the cultural life of Scotland cannot be overstated, and yet this latest decision leaves it in an extremely compromised situation, the cultural ramifications of which are huge.\\" The online petition, which reached 39,239 signatures, claimed the loss of the nightclub licence would endanger the city's arts scene and economy. It also accused the police of \\"harassment\\". Shortly after the news was announced \\"The Arches\\" began trending on twitter. The Arches thanked Glasgow City Council for their support over the years tweeting: \\"THANK YOU @CreativeScots @GlasgowCC, all our staff & artists, and all of YOU for 25 years of support. #TeamArches\\" Underground house DJ Bontan, who had previously headlined at the Arches, tweeted: \\"Absolutely gutted about The Arches.

What is a component that all CPUs have?","completion":"A component that all CPUs (Central Processing Units) have is the program counter. The program counter is a special type of memory cell, known as a register, that keeps track of the location in memory from which the next instruction is to be read. It plays a vital role in the operation of the CPU, as it helps manage the flow of instructions and ensures that they are executed in the correct sequence. The program counter is incremented after the execution of each instruction, pointing to the next instruction location in memory. This process enables the CPU to fetch and decode instructions in a sequential manner, which is crucial for the proper execution of programs stored in memory. In addition to the program counter, CPUs also contain several other components, such as the ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit), which performs arithmetic and logical operations; registers, which store temporary data or instruction information; and the control unit, which manages the entire process of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions by coordinating the activity of other components within the CPU. Overall, the program counter is a key component found in all CPUs, enabling them to manage instruction flow and execute programs stored in memory accurately and efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What novel by Ray Bradbury was named for the temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns?","completion":"The novel by Ray Bradbury that was named for the temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns is \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Published in 1953, Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian science fiction novel that explores a future society where books are banned, and \\"firemen\\" are tasked with burning any books they find to suppress dissenting ideas and maintain government control over information. Fahrenheit 451 is set in an unnamed American city in a future that seems both distant yet disturbingly relatable. The protagonist of the story, Guy Montag, is a fireman who spends his days destroying books as his job. The title, \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" refers to the temperature at which paper is believed to ignite, marking it the perfect name for a novel centered around the burning of books. The story begins with Montag meeting a young woman named Clarisse McClellan, who challenges his worldview and forces him to confront his own values. Consequently, Montag starts questioning the regime and its ban on books. He becomes increasingly curious about the world of literature and begins hoarding books in his own home. His wife, Mildred, reports him to the authorities, leading to a series of events that force Montag to confront his role in perpetuating the oppressive regime. Fahrenheit 451 serves as a powerful critique of government censorship, conformity, and the suppression of intellectual freedom. It is all the more relevant in today's digital world, where information is increasingly controlled, and individual privacy and freedom of expression are continuously challenged. The novel argues for the importance of diverse ideas and perspectives and warns against the dangers of a society where independent thought is stifled. The book became an immediate success upon its release, earning critical acclaim and a large readership. Since its publication, Fahrenheit 451 has been widely studied in both high school and college curricula and has been adapted into various media forms, including a 1966 film directed by François Truffaut, a 2018 film directed by Ramin Bahrani, and a graphic novel adapted by Tim Hamilton. In conclusion, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a groundbreaking and timeless piece of literature that poses essential questions about government control, censorship, and the importance of intellectual freedom. With its powerful portrayal of a world in which books are burned to suppress different ideas, it serves as a valuable reminder of the need to protect and value artistic expression and free thought."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Before you endorse the check, make sure it's one that your bank will accept, and that all the information on the front is correct. If the person who gave you the check spelled your name wrong or made a mistake, you may want to give it back to them and have them write you another check. While some banks will accept a check that has been changed as long as the person who wrote the check initials the change, many banks are suspicious of this. It's better to have the person write you another check. A valid check has a line at the bottom with the routing number and account number. If that line isn't present, the bank will not be able to process the check. If only your name is listed on the payee line of the check, your signature is all that is needed to cash or deposit the check. If someone's else name is also listed, they only have to sign the check if the word \\"and\\" or the symbol \\"&\\" appears between the 2 names. The default rule is that a check with 2 or more names can be cashed or deposited individually by any of the people listed on the check. If the check says \\"or,\\" or includes ambiguous language or symbols (such as a dash or a slash), either of the people named can cash or deposit the check. If the check is written to you \\"℅\\" (meaning \\"care of\\") someone else, only your signature is needed. They generally cannot cash or deposit the check without your signature. However, if you have a joint bank account, they may be able to deposit the check in that account on your behalf without your signature. If you flip over the check, you'll see 3 to 5 gray lines. These typically appear on the upper short side of the check. You'll also see a solid line with instructions not to write below the line. The bank needs the remaining blank space under the endorsement area to document the processing of the check. Make sure your signature doesn't extend into that space, or the bank may refuse the check. To endorse a check, you typically only have to sign your name in pen using blue or black ink. If your name on the check differs from your name on your government-issued photo ID, or on your bank account, you may want to print the correct spelling of your name under your signature. If you're signing a business check, include the business's name on the line above your name. You may also want to add your job title to show you are authorized to cash or deposit the check in the name of the company. Once you've signed the check, it becomes a \\"bearer instrument,\\" meaning anyone who finds it can cash it. If you're traveling to the bank, don't sign your check until you get there. If you go to a bank to cash the check and you don't have an account with that bank, you typically must show a government-issued photo ID. You may also have to provide a thumbprint for identification services. Check cashing services will charge you a fee to cash the check. Banks typically charge a fee as well, unless you have an account with that bank. If you don't have a bank account, you may want to take this opportunity to open one, using the check is your initial balance. Otherwise, you can get the check cashed at a check-cashing service available at discount or grocery stores. You can also go to the bank that issued the check. That bank will have its name and logo printed on the front of the check.","completion":"This article explains how to make sure a check is valid and can be cashed or deposited, how to endorse it with your signature and other important details, and where you can cash the check if needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: How might someone feel if they were committing perjury? - embarrassment indictment - tension - going to jail - penalty - mistrial The best answer is Answer:","completion":"When answering the question, \\"How might someone feel if they were committing perjury?\\", one should consider the different emotions and consequences someone might experience as a result of their dishonest actions. Step 1: Understand the emotions and consequences related to committing perjury. - Embarrassment - Indictment - Tension - Going to jail - Penalty - Mistrial Step 2: Identify and analyze how these emotions and consequences might affect an individual. Embarrassment: An individual might feel embarrassment due to the knowledge that they are lying under oath, which is a serious offense. This emotion may arise out of the fear of being exposed for their dishonesty or disgrace in their own actions. Indictment: Understanding that perjury could lead to an indictment, an individual may feel anxious or worried about the potential legal consequences of their actions. Tension: Lying under oath can create tension, especially if the individual fears they might be caught or if they are unsure about how their dishonesty will affect others involved in the trial. Going to jail: The possibility of going to jail as a result of committing perjury can provoke feelings of fear, dread, and anxiety in the individual. Penalty: Facing penalties such as fines or other legal repercussions for committing perjury may cause an individual to feel concerned and apprehensive about their future. Mistrial: The potential for causing a mistrial due to perjury may bring about feelings of guilt or responsibility, especially if the individual's actions negatively impact the outcome of a case. Step 3: Provide a comprehensive answer that takes all these factors into consideration. Answer: Someone committing perjury may experience a range of emotions, such as embarrassment, tension, and anxiety stemming from their dishonest actions and the potential consequences they may face. In addition, they might feel dread and worry due to possible legal repercussions, including indictment, going to jail, and penalties. Lastly, guilt may be present because of the potential impact on the trial, such as causing a mistrial."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. How long should athletes probably eat protein? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - All the time - even when they aren't working out - Only after working out - not enough information - Only before working out A:","completion":"Not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At Covent Garden one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality.

You may have to wait a few more minutes for the cream cheese to be ready. Dice the peppers, tomatoes, and olives. After softening the cream cheese, it is natural to progress to preparing the vegetables that will be added to the Halloween taco dip. While waiting for the cream cheese to reach the desired consistency, you can use the time to dice the peppers, tomatoes, and olives. This ensures that all your ingredients are ready for assembly once the cream cheese is softened. Here's a more detailed elaboration on how to make halloween taco dip: 1. Soften the cream cheese: Allow the cream cheese to come to room temperature so that it is easier to spread and mix with other ingredients. If you're in a hurry, you can soften it in the microwave using a microwave-safe bowl at intervals of 10-15 seconds, checking and stirring in between until softened to your liking. 2. Dice the vegetables: While waiting for the cream cheese to soften, wash and dice the peppers, tomatoes, and olives into small, even pieces, approximately 0.5 cm long or smaller. If you prefer, you can also add other ingredients to your dip, such as onions, scallions, or even corn. 3. Combine the ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, mix the softened cream cheese with sour cream or mayonnaise (or a combination of both) until smooth. You can also add taco seasoning to the mix for an extra punch of flavor. Once the base is smooth, gently fold in the diced peppers, tomatoes, and olives until evenly distributed. 4. Assemble the layers: In a deep, glass serving dish or a disposable aluminum pan, spread a layer of the cream cheese mixture evenly across the bottom. On top of this layer, add layers of shredded cheese, chopped lettuce, and any additional toppings that suit your taste, such as jalapeños, black beans, or avocado. 5. Garnish and serve: Once you've assembled all the layers, you can add an extra sprinkle of shredded cheese and a handful of tortilla chips for an added crunch. Serve the Halloween taco dip alongside a large bowl of tortilla chips, and enjoy the festive treat with friends and family!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The kind of food we eat depends on which part of the world we live in, or which part of our country we live in. For example, in the south of China they eat rice, but in the north they eat noodles. In European countries near the sea, people eat a lot of fish. In central Europe, away from the sea, people don't eat so much fish, but they eat more meat. For example, in Germany and Poland, there are hundreds of different kinds of sausages. In North America, Australia, and Europe, people eat with knives and forks. In China, people eat with chopsticks.

It removed the word \\"patience\\" from its regular statement. The language was seen as an indication that the central bank would refrain from raising rates for at least a few months. But the Fed said it would wait until it saw \\"further improvement\\" in the US labour market before raising rates. US shares rose sharply on the news. A delayed rate rise is good news for US companies, who will remain able to borrow cheaply for some time yet. That cheered investors, who pushed the Dow Jones higher by 0.9% or 159 points to 18,008, while the broader S&P 500 rose 1% to 2,096. Many market watchers had expected the Fed to signal on Wednesday that it would move towards a rate rise in June or September. However, in a statement released at the end of its two-day policy meeting in Washington, DC, the Federal Reserve warned that US economic growth had \\"moderated somewhat\\" since January. Fed officials added that it would \\"appropriate\\" to raise interest rates once there had been \\"further improvement in the labor market\\" and cautioned that \\"this change in the forward guidance does not indicate that the Committee has decided on the timing of the initial increase\\". The chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, said in a press conference following the release of the statement that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did \\"not want to rule out the possibility\\" of a rate rise, but any move would \\"depend on the committee's assessment if incoming information\\". \\"Just because we removed the word patient from the statement doesn't mean we're going to be impatient,\\" she added. A recent spate of disappointing US economic data, such as lower retail sales and consumer sentiment, has led some economist to call for a rate rise to be delayed even further. \\"The Fed is in no rush,\\" said Ward McCarthy, chief US economist at Jefferies. \\"At the current juncture, the timing of the liftoff is still indeterminate and will depend upon the inflation data. The policy statement eliminated the use of 'patient' in forward guidance, but the FOMC also described the new forward guidance as being \\"consistent\\" with the prior forward guidance.\\" He added: \\"The word 'patient' was removed, but the meaning of patient remained.\\" For investors this was billed as the biggest Federal Reserve policy meeting in years. The Fed under the leadership of Janet Yellen is trying to prepare the world for the first US rate hike in nearly a decade. By dropping the word patient from its statement, America's central bank signalled its intention to start gradually raising interest rates from their record lows. The world's largest economy is improving. Jobs are returning. But the recovery in the housing market is subdued. Exports have slowed as the value of the dollar has climbed. And wages remain stagnant. Ultra low rates are meant to encourage borrowing and spending to fuel growth. The Fed is now seeing that the recovery is looking strong enough to be able to support higher rates. But the exact timing...well that remains a mystery. The only certainty is that those higher rates won't come in April. As for any more clues? Ms Yellen refused to provide any hints during her press conference: \\"We can't provide certainty and shouldn't provide certainty because economic developments that will unfold are uncertain,\\" she said.

First of all, always check and double-check departure time. It is surprising how few people really do this carefully. Once I arrived at he airport a few minutes after ten. My secretary had got the ticket for me and I thought she had said that the plane left at 10:50. When I arrived at the airport, the person at the departure desk told me that my flight was closed. Therefore, I had to wait three hours for the next one and missed an important meeting. The second rule is to remember that even in this age of credit cards , it is still important to have some local money in cash . Once I arrived at a place at midnight and the bank at the airport was closed. The only way to get to my hotel was by taxi but because I had no dollars, I offered to pay in pounds instead. \\"Listen! I only take real money!\\" the driver said angrily. You can imagine how terrible I felt at that moment. The third and the last rule is to find out as much as you can about the weather at your destination before you leave. I feel sorry for some of my workmates who travel in heavy suits and raincoats in May, when it is still fairly cool in London or Manchester, to places like Athens, Rome of Madrid, where it is already beginning to get quite warm during the day.

Write a text based on \\"confusion over nigerian response to cup ban\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Confusion Over Nigerian Response to Cup Ban In recent days, the Nigerian football community has experienced a whirlwind of emotions. The country's response to the recent ban imposed on its national team from participating in the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) has been mired in confusion, leaving football enthusiasts and administrators puzzled and seeking clarity on the situation. Step 1: Understanding the Background To provide a comprehensive overview of this issue, it's necessary to revisit the events leading to the ban. The Nigerian national team, also known as the Super Eagles, were accused of fielding an ineligible player in a crucial AFCON qualifier match. As a result, they suffered a point deduction and were subsequently prohibited from taking part in the competition. Step 2: Evaluating the Nigerian Response Following the announcement of the ban, the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) appeared perplexed, which was evident in their lack of a coherent and unified response. While some NFF officials accepted the decision and promised to appeal, others refuted the claims, blaming the referee and match officials for the controversial outcome. Step 3: Assessing Public Reactions The confusion surrounding the Nigerian response has not only affected the football federation but also the entire nation. Fans and pundits have been eagerly following the developments and expressing their opinions on social media platforms. The uncertainty has led people to question the organization and competency of the NFF, as well as the integrity of the sport in the country. Step 4: Analyzing the Impact on Nigerian Football The AFCON ban has undoubtedly cast a shadow over Nigerian football, with negative implications for the sport's future in the country. The Super Eagles' absence from the prestigious tournament may have repercussions on the team's morale and confidence, potentially affecting their performances at both domestic and international levels. Furthermore, the fiasco has exposed weaknesses within the NFF and could possibly deter future sponsorships and partnerships. Step 5: Exploring Possible Solutions To remedy this situation and prevent similar incidents in the future, it is imperative that the NFF takes effective measures to streamline its decision-making processes and establish transparency in its actions. Implementing stricter guidelines for player eligibility, thorough record-keeping, and enhancing communication between team officials and players can help foster trust and prevent misunderstandings. In conclusion, the confusion over Nigeria's response to the AFCON ban has undoubtedly raised several concerns about the management and governance of Nigerian football. With the right corrective measures and commitment to transparency, it is hoped that the Super Eagles can soar high once again, making amends for this unfortunate setback and working towards a more promising future in the sport."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Professor Otto Lidenbrock followed Arne Saknussemm where?","completion":"Professor Otto Lidenbrock followed Arne Saknussemm on a remarkable journey to the center of the Earth. This extraordinary adventure was first introduced in the 1864 science fiction novel \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" written by French author Jules Verne. In the story, the Icelandic alchemist and natural scientist Arne Saknussemm was said to have discovered a passage to the Earth's core in the 16th century. The journey began when Professor Lidenbrock, a German scientist, stumbled upon a coded message in an ancient manuscript written by Arne Saknussemm. The message insisted that Saknussemm had found a pathway to the Earth's center through the Snæfellsjökull volcano in Iceland. Upon discovering this, Professor Lidenbrock, his nephew Axel, and their Icelandic guide, Hans Belker, embarked on an expedition to follow in Saknussemm's footsteps. The trio commenced their expedition by traveling to Iceland and climbing the Snæfellsjökull volcano. Upon reaching the top, they discovered a crater with three vertical shafts, one of which was the entrance that Arne Saknussemm had indicated in his coded message. This particular shaft was only accessible during the days of June 25th to June 28th, as the specific angle of sunlight illuminated the correct passage during this time. The adventurers descended the volcanic tube, equipped with the necessary gear and provisions for their journey. They faced many challenges and wonders during their descent, including underground oceans, prehistoric forests, and giant caverns. Throughout the trip, they encountered various phenomena and creatures from the Earth's past, including giant insects, plesiosaurs, and a human-like creature referred to as the \\"Man of the Stone Age.\\" After a series of adventures and near-disasters, the trio eventually reached the Earth's core, witnessing a subterranean world filled with astonishing marvels. From there, they made their ascent back to the Earth's surface through an explosive volcanic eruption in the Stromboli volcano off the coast of Italy. In summary, Professor Otto Lidenbrock followed Arne Saknussemm on a fantastical journey to the center of the Earth, which took them through the Snæfellsjökull volcano in Iceland and led them to explore previously unknown realms deep beneath the Earth's surface. The thrilling account of their journey, as written by Jules Verne, remains an enduring classic in science fiction literature and continues to inspire readers and spark imaginations to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Earlier this year,my oldest daughter got braces on her teeth,and let's just say she did not go quietly into that dentist's chair.Fear and hate pretty much describe the days leading up to her first appointment. So when she finally walked out with shiny teeth,a sore mouth and a broken spirit,I told her I was proud of her and took her to Ben &Jerry's for an ice cream reward.Two weeks later,we returned to the scene of the crime.The dentist spent about 45 seconds checking her teeth before sending her on her merry way.Before I could start the car, she was placing her ice cream order.She was shocked when I told her that she wasn't going to get a reward every time we get her teeth checked. Clearly,she's not alone.According to some parenting experts,kids are easily addicted to a benefit--producing system of parental rewards and bribes--it's not all ice creams,candies and cool toys.Some parents are offering their children prizes to just let them sit down and behave in a restaurant--or sleep in their own beds--or score a goal in the next soccer game. While the experts agree that occasional awards are okay, the danger lies in the system's overuse.Kids quickly gain a sense of entitlement ,where they come to expect a big reward for every good thing that they do,no matter how small.To keep things in check,experts say parents should reduce the number of rewards they offer,make sure rewards match the behavior and explain the real benefits of behaving for the sake of behaving.

Confiding to his friend Michael Morgan (Ian Hendry) that Damien is the Antichrist, Bugenhagen attempts to convince him to give Damien's guardian a box containing the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to some local ruins to see the mural of Yigael's Wall, which was said to have been drawn by one who saw the Devil and had visions of the Antichrist as he would appear from birth to death. Though Morgan believes him upon seeing an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face, both he and Bugenhagen are buried alive as the tunnel collapses on them. Seven years later, the 12-year old Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is living with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his wife, Ann (Lee Grant). Damien gets along well with his cousin Mark (Lucas Donat), Richard's son from his first marriage, with whom he is enrolled in a military academy.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who decided to devote themselves to portrait painting in 1856? George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

Board games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history. Do you think of yourself as a bit of an expert at board games like chess or Go? Maybe you're not quite as good as you think. New research from the University of Manchester and Oxford suggests complex games like these are impossible to learn fully. They may even be too complex for the human mind to understand. Researchers studied two-player games, to try and understand the strategies which people use to make decisions during the game. Some games with two players are simple, with only a small number of possible moves. Players can quickly work out the best strategy but that means the game soon becomes boring. It gets more interesting when there are many possible moves. That's why people are so fascinated by complex board games like chess or Go, or some card games. But what the researchers found was that with difficult games, players find it hard to work out the best strategy and their actions become less reasonable. This research is part of the field called game theory: the study of human strategic decision-making. Much thinking on how people play complex games is based on something called \\"the balance point\\", which is when players have a perfect knowledge of what they are going to do and of what their rivals are going to do. When you add more than two players then of course the game becomes even harder to understand. Trading on the stock market is an example of a complex multi-player game.

The owner of the Redskins said that he was not planning to change the team name but his next door neighbor appears to have other ideas. Denial:. A spokesman for the Redkins denied the team were contemplating a name change. Change it: In an interview with the Associated Press yesterday, President Obama said if he were the owner of the Washington Redskins football team, he would change the name so as not to offend Native Americans. The filing has started rumors spreading that the Washington Redskins may be about to change its name. The wording used on the filing documents is similar to that used for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. A spokesman for the Redkins denied the team were contemplating a name change. “There is no connection between the Washington Redskins and the trademark application,” said a team spokesman. “Dan Snyder does not know the man named in the story.” However, this appeared to be untrue. Rumors: Owner Daniel Snyder created a company called Washington Brave Hearts, LLC. Cheering them on: A view of the Washington Redskins cheerleaders during a game against the Dallas Cowboys at the Redskins Stadium in Landover, Maryland. Mr Snyder and Mr Mardirossian worked together in a lawsuit back in 2005. against the National Park Service in a fight to chop down trees in front. of their homes, in a request that was denied. Simply because a. trademark has been established doesn't necessarily mean the Redskins are. about to change their name, however the timing is interesting given the. recent controversy surrounding the racial aspect of the “Redskins” name. Earlier this month President Barack Obama weighed in on the. debate saying that if he owned the Washington Redskins, he would 'think. about changing' the team name. Chinese whispers: Maybe this is all smoke and no fire however SNyder's neighbor Mardirossian registered the domain WashingtonBravehearts.com on October 18. Obama, in an interview with The Associated Press, he said team names like the Redskins offend 'a sizable group of people.' He said that while fans get attached to the nicknames, nostalgia may not be a good enough reason to keep them in place. 'I don't want to detract from the wonderful Redskins fans that are here. They love their team and rightly so,' he said. But. the president appeared to come down on the side of those who have. sharply criticized the football team's name, noting that Indians 'feel. pretty strongly' about mascots and team names that depict negative. stereotypes about their heritage. Depictions: The Redskins players above are shown wearing helmets depicting the team's mascot - a Native American Indian. Sticking with it: Ten members of Congress sent a letter to the NFL commissioner last May, asking for the name to be changed. Owner Daniel Snyder said he would never change the name (pictured right) Other professional sports teams have. Indian nicknames, including football's Kansas City Chiefs and baseball's. Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians. Numerous colleges and universities have changed names that reference Native Americans. St. John's changed its mascot. from the Redmen to the Red Storm, Marquette is now the Golden Eagles. instead of the Warriors and Stanford switched from the Indians to the. Cardinal. The. Redskins' nickname has attracted a fresh round of controversy in recent. months, with local leaders in Washington calling for a name change and. some media outlets refraining from using the name. Protest: Those against the mascot and team. name plan protested in. Washington, D.C. earlier this month. Above, the team's mascot in 1995. The name is the subject of a. long-running legal challenge from a group of American Indians seeking to. block the team from having federal trademark protection. Congressional lawmakers have introduced a bill seeking the same goal, though it appears unlikely to pass. Team. owner Dan Snyder has vowed to never abandon the name. But NFL. Commissioner Roger Goodell said last month that the league should pay. attention to those offended by the nickname. Time for change? Snyder watches from the sidelines before a game against Detroit on September 22. Several other sports teams have changed their names in the past so as not to offend Native Americans. Despite the controversy, an AP-GfK poll conducted in April showed that nationally, 'Redskins' still enjoys wide support. Nearly. 4 in 5 Americans don't think the team should change its name, the. survey found. Only 11 percent think it should be changed, while 8. percent weren't sure and 2 percent didn't answer. Keep it: According to a poll conducted by the AP and GfK, four out of five Americans think the team should keep their name.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: If your dog is in pain it may struggle or bite while you try to treat its wound. If possible, have another family member or friend restrain your dog while you examine its injury. Be sure to handle your dog firmly but gently to avoid causing it extra pain. To restrain your dog, kneel down by your dog's side so you're facing its head. Then, take your arm that's furthest from your dog and hook it under your dog's chin. Take your other arm and wrap it around your dog's chest, behind its front legs. Finally, pull your dog close to your body and hold it there. Restraining your dog may help to calm it down if it feels panicked by its injury. Even the most docile dog may bite its owner after suffering a disorienting injury. Before treating your dog's wound, muzzle it gently to prevent biting. Be sure that the muzzle does not touch the wound. If your dog's wound is located too close to its mouth to muzzle it, proceed with caution. If you do not have a muzzle, you can wrap gauze around your dog's mouth temporarily to keep it from biting you. If your dog has a small wound, cover it with a clean piece of medical gauze. Apply constant pressure to the wound for up to 20 minutes to slow or stop the bleeding. If your dog has a large laceration, place a clean towel over the wound. If the bleeding continues after 20 minutes, bring your dog to a vet right away. Gently wrap a sports bandage or a long strand of soft material around your dog's head, limb, or torso to keep the gauze over the wound. Avoid wrapping it too tight, which may restrict your dog's breathing or circulation. Tie the bandage or material firmly with a knot. Avoid using tape to keep the bandage in place as it will adhere to your dog's fur and cause irritation and hair loss. If one of your dog's front or back paws is injured, you can slow down the bleeding by raising it above heart level. This will be the easiest to do if your dog is lying on its side, with the injured limb facing upwards. Keep gentle pressure on the wound. Similarly, if your dog has an ear injury and long ears, gently pull the ear up above its head to help stop the bleeding. Your dog may get an infection if its wound is left untreated for more than a day or two. Bring your dog to a veterinarian as soon as you can to evaluate and treat the injury. Your vet can also provide advice for how to care for the wound while it heals. Your vet may also have to check for internal bleeding, depending on the injury your dog suffered.","completion":"When treating a dog's injury, have someone restrain the dog gently while you examine the wound.

Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World. The song has since appeared on television shows, and in 2005 reached number-eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was not included on the soundtrack.

By stating that the subject will make an even greater splash than these famous individuals, the sentence suggests that the subject's success will surpass that of these established actors. This comparison elevates the subject and signals a positive sentiment.

I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact.

He is trying to see how to make chemical reactions within organism easier. To that end, he conducts two tests, test A an test B, on an organism. In test A he reduces catalysts from the organism, but in test B he induces catalysts in the organism. He needs to observe the outcomes of these tests. But I can use this background: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts. What is an answer for this question: Would test B see reactions taking place slower or faster than test A? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background information and the two tests conducted by Mark, test B is likely to observe reactions taking place faster than in test A. In test A, Mark reduces the catalysts (enzymes) within the organism. This means that there are fewer biological catalysts available to speed up the chemical reactions. As a result, the reactions will likely occur at a slower rate since there is less assistance for the reactants to meet and collide effectively, making it harder for life processes to occur quickly enough. In test B, Mark induces more catalysts (enzymes) in the organism. This increase in enzymes means that there are more biological catalysts available to facilitate the chemical reactions. Consequently, this should enhance the rate of reactions, as the catalysts help in increasing the chances of reactants meeting and colliding, speeding up the life processes. Therefore, test B should see chemical reactions taking place at a faster rate compared to test A, as the presence of more enzymes (biological catalysts) accelerates the reactions within the organism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I was once dating this girl from college who showed genuine interest in me and for that and many other reasons, I really liked her. Well, you could say I loved her. We had been together for a week. One day, we went on a trip. It was all fun and games and laughing. I had the best time of my life. We were walking on the beach of a lake during sunset. We were talking and suddenly, I felt her tone getting more and more depressed. At some point, she concluded that “we need to take a break.” Trying to understand her arguments for that, the break turned into a breakup. Now, one-week-into-a-relationship-with-awesome-girl me couldn’t handle this sudden change of affairs. I spent weeks reliving this day, especially the conversation on the beach, and trying to figure out where it went wrong. I even got into an episode of mania. Having to see her every day in college was torture. It was probably the worst breakup in my life. I seriously considered transferring to another university. Several weeks into the breakup, I decided, with the aid of my friends, that I have to move on. To be honest, I relapsed a lot. One time, I actually sat down with her and said I still have feelings for her. What really helped me to get out of this was the thing I hated the most at that time: taking a break. I avoided her, in real life and on social media, and eventually, I forgot that she even existed. I developed new hobbies and made new friends. Now, I healed properly and we’re back to being friends (Yes, it’s possible to stay friends with your ex).

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Helen got lots of different fruit as a gift from a friend that owned an orchard.

Handling delicate newspapers that you want to preserve requires a lot of care and extra precautions. This means washing your hands before touching the newspapers to remove any possibly damaging residue on your hands. Options: 1. One advantage of wet newspapers is that these are like regular paper, with only a few layers of gauze added to improve absorbency. Wear gloves when handling wet newspaper for the fastest preparation.; 2. This also prevents yourself from burning your hands while you're handling fragile newspaper or other materials. Do not wash your newspapers more often.; 3. After washing them, you should take them to the dry cleaners where you won't have to deal with accidental exposure or infection. Be very careful when handling delicate newspaper.; 4. You should also have a clean workspace-like a big, clean table-to use while handing the newspapers. Make sure your hands are dry before touching the newspaper, especially if you just washed your hands.; Answer:","completion":"4.

Write highlights for this article: A landscape restoration of a rubbish dump has won the Energy, Waste and Recycling category at the 2008 World Architecture Festival in Barcelona, Spain. Spanish architects Batlle and Roig have returned a 150 hectare rubbish dump back to nature. \\"La Vall d'en Joan\\" (The Valley of Joan) project, designed by Spanish architects Batlle and Roig, has transformed a 150 hectare site in the Garraf Natural Park, south-west of Barcelona into a green terraced agricultural landscape. In awarding the prize, judges Luis Mansilla -- Mansilla + Tunon architects -- and Martin Keiding -- editor-in-chief of Arkitektur DK -- described the scheme as: \\"a perfect example of bringing dead nature back to life by converting rubbish into a beautiful piece of landscape architecture...using few and humble means\\". Joan Roig of Batlle and Roig Architects told CNN: \\"The idea was to create a system of hills and banks in a way that would avoid erosion from water and to give the rubbish dump back to nature with a natural design.\\" Work to transform the site -- the largest landfill in Spain -- began in 2000 and was completed earlier this year. It is a striking redrawing of a previously scarred and polluted landscape. The landfill has been servicing Barcelona's metropolitan area for over 30 years. More than 20 million tons of rubbish was spread around the valley before the site was closed in 2006. In some places, you would have to dig down over 100 meters before you found soil again. But this isn't just a cosmetic makeover. There is an underground drainage system on site which filters contaminated waste fluids. Part of this recycled water is then used to irrigate the park. \\"The whole project is very sustainable,\\" Roig said. Furthermore, the dump is also utilizing the bio gas that is emitted to provide electricity. Some of the rubbish has remained above ground. Housed in large steel cages which flank the entrance to the site, Roig says they serve as a permanent reminder to visitors of the site's previous life. Judge, Martin Keiding told CNN: \\"It's a very beautiful and simple design. It is landscape architecture that is inspiring. It is a very good example that everyone could look at and say: 'We could do the same.' This competition is about pointing out good examples that could inspire architects.\\" Batlle and Roig's winning design was one of eight short-listed projects in the Energy, Waste and Recycling category, which was notable for the variety of entries. They range from state of the art, hi-tech plans such as the Digital Beijing designed by Studio Pei Zhu and Urbanus, right down to low-cost, primitive ventures like the Community Cooker devised by Kenyan company, Planning Systems Services. The communal cooker is turning rubbish into fuel to feed residents of one of Africa's biggest slums -- Kibera -- on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya. The project was highly commended by the judges. \\"Sustainability is a very important issue and so are the questions about rubbish, especially in Third World countries,\\" Keiding said. \\"The community cooker is a way of introducing a solution directly into the society.\\" Keiding, himself a trained architect, believes that Energy, Waste and Recycling is the most important category at the inaugural World Architecture Festival. \\"We are facing big problems, so it is a great opportunity for architects to work seriously with this problem on many different levels. \\"I think flashy executive buildings are interesting in one sense but they are not interesting if they are not dealing seriously with this matter. In my opinion you can throw them out. We have to be far more serious about integrating aspects of sustainability into architecture.\\" Both Mansilla and Keiding noted that engineering and architecture had to combine to deal with issues concerning waste and recycling. They said that achieving sustainability was a difficult task but it also represented a great opportunity for architects to contribute to the sphere.","completion":"Spanish architects Batlle and Roig have won the Energy, Waste and Recycling category at the 2008 World Architecture Festival for their landscape restoration of a 150-hectare rubbish dump.

The old man saw that the child was very cute, and he wanted to give her a whole basket of fish. But the child shook her head.

But if I have the fishing rod, I can go fishing by myself and I won't be afraid of not having any more fish to eat.\\" I think you will certainly say that the child is very smart. Wrong!

Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East. Jamess final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the 2016 NBA Playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the 2016 NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors season, who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3-1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including The Block (basketball) on Andre Iguodala, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the Cleveland sports curse and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3-1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.

However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru. The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions. Despite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit. \\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\\" a senior administration official said. The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration. Trump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border. Trump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall. The disagreement become so heated earlier this year that Pena Nieto canceled plans to visit the White House. It is not clear whether Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Pena Nieto during the summit, U.S. officials said.

The problem is that while men such as Bundy and Sterling may be racist, they are not the face of racism. Not today's version. But we'll place that yoke on their shoulders anyway because it's easy, like James dunking on a kiddie rim. Some conservatives will quickly pedal away from the Bundys and the Ted Nugents of the world, insisting that they are not like those rodeo clowns. They don't have a racist bone in their body because they would never make such outlandish statements. But then they turn around and marvel at how \\"well-spoken\\" or \\"articulate\\" a black person is and think nothing of it. Politicians of all stripes will publicly denounce the offensive things that Bundy says but continue to construct policies that cater to his sensibilities. Today, racism isn't a crazy old white man with a dead calf on his shoulders proclaiming he's \\"unracist.\\" No, it's elected officials such as U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin saying inner-city men are \\"not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work\\" and then feigning shock that people saw a racist element to his statements. Bundy and Sterling are just the lightning rods of the moment. Not too long ago, Paula Deen was the social pariah. Meanwhile, Racism 2.0 is busily working in the shadows, gerrymandering away voting rights and creating legislation that makes pre-emptively shooting dead a young black man who makes you nervous synonymous with standing one's ground. The longer the media allow ignorant relics like Bundy to continue to hog the spotlight -- and the public points at him as the face of conservative racism -- the longer the current incarnation can go unchecked. That doesn't mean Bundy's fight with the government should be ignored. That doesn't mean Sterling's alleged remarks -- and well-documented past of discrimination -- should be overlooked. Only that their views -- and thus, importance -- should be kept in perspective. For mispronouncing Rosa Parks' name pales in comparison to the politics of courting a racist electorate. It pales in comparison to the lack of compassion for the five children who were shot Easter Sunday at a park on the south side of Chicago or the characterization of poor people as takers. During the height of the recession, according to an analysis in The American Prospect, 33 states increased spending on prisons while decreasing spending on education, and we're to believe the disproportionate number of minorities in jail is a coincidence? So, yeah, yuk it up at Bundy's expense. Keep tweeting #boycottClippers if it makes you feel better (though I'd be more prone to use my 140 characters to ask why the NAACP thought Sterling was a good candidate for a lifetime achievement award). But don't make such people out to be anything more than what they are -- the few remaining voices of oppression from years past. Today racism has a different look. A different sound. A different voice -- though the song is still the same. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article suggests that while it may be easy to criticize and ridicule people like Cliven Bundy and Don Sterling for their racist remarks, they are not the true face of modern-day racism. Racism today is more subtle and lies in the actions of politicians and institutions that create policies catering to racist sensibilities or perpetuate inequality. Examples given include gerrymandering, voter suppression, and disproportionate spending on prisons over education. The author argues that focusing on the blatant racism of a few individuals distracts from addressing the systemic racism that continues to go unchecked."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Information: - The coconut tree (\\"Cocos nucifera\\") is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family) and the only species of the genus \\"Cocos\\". The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word \\"coco\\" meaning \\"head\\" or \\"skull\\", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur. - Coconut milk is the liquid that comes from the grated meat of a brown coconut . It should not be confused with coconut water . The color and rich taste of coconut milk can be attributed to the high oil content . Most of the fat is saturated fat . Coconut milk is a very popular food ingredient used in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Southern China , the Caribbean and north of South America . - Coconut water is the clear liquid inside young green coconuts (fruits of the coconut palm). In early development, it serves as a suspension for the endosperm of the coconut during the nuclear phase of development. As growth continues, the endosperm matures into its cellular phase and deposits into the rind of the coconut meat. - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.

It's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics. Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . I've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review is mostly positive.

Situation: More snakes are hungrier because of chickens leaving. Now, let's discuss the steps and the potential impacts of the situation. Step 1 and 2: As the birds lay eggs and they hatch into baby birds, the number of birds will initially increase. Step 3: Baby birds need to eat to grow. At this step, the situation comes into play. If there are more hungry snakes due to the departure of chickens, it is likely that these snakes will start preying on the baby birds to satiate their hunger. This can potentially decrease the number of baby birds that survive to adulthood. Step 4: If fewer baby birds grow into adult birds due to predation by the hungrier snakes, there will be a smaller population of adult birds. Step 5 and 6: With a smaller adult bird population, there may be fewer opportunities for mating and nest-building, which could lead to fewer bird pairs laying eggs in the future.

Hackers steal 83 million Chase customers’ info In a massive cyber-attack on JPMorgan Chase, hackers stole the personal information of a staggering 83 million customers, the banking giant revealed Thursday. It took the bank more than two months to detect the largest known data breach in history, which began in June and affected 76 million households and 7 million small-business owners, sources told The Post. The hackers were able to get access to customer data through “external sites” such as chase.com, said one person familiar with the investigation. JPMorgan insisted that while the cyber-thieves accessed addresses, ­e-mail info and phone numbers, other sensitive information — such as account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth and Social Security numbers — were not affected. Experts, though, were dubious about that claim. “The cynic in me says if [that additional data] were on the same system, they probably had access to it and they’ve probably taken it,” said Rob Sloan, head of ­cyber-content and data for Dow Jones Risk and Compliance. The bank said there had not been any unusual customer-fraud reports related to the huge data breach, adding that customers would not be held liable for any unauthorized transactions on their accounts. The attack also targeted “internal JPMorgan Chase information” such as customer profiles. That internal information describes if clients have a mortgage or auto loan, as well as indicating their net worth, said JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler. Bloomberg News reported that hackers in Russia were behind the breach, but sources told The Post that the identity of the cyber-thieves remains unclear. The bank — the nation’s largest when ranked by assets — has been cooperating with law enforcement. CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prophetic message in his April 9 annual shareholder letter that despite spending millions on cyber-security, JPMorgan remained worried about the threat of attacks. By the end of this year, the bank estimated that it will be spending about 250 million annually on ­cyber-security and employing 1,000 people in that area. In August, the FBI said it was working with the Secret Service to determine the scope of recent cyber-attacks against several American financial institutions and retailers.

The term \\"greenlight\\", in this context, is slang for an authorization to carry out a violent act, likely against a rival gang or member.

The fact that an innocent unborn child was also affected by the violence creates a stronger negative impression. 3. \\"thats fucked up anyway u look at it\\": The tweet concludes with the author's opinion on this matter, using informal language and a strong curse word to express their strong disapproval and condemnable sentiment towards the events mentioned.

Question: Information: - In Greek mythology, Eurotas was a king of Laconia, the son of King Myles and grandson of Lelex, eponymous ancestor of the Leleges. He had no male heir, but he did have a daughter Sparta and wife Clete. Eurotas bequeathed the kingdom to Lacedaemon, the son of Taygete, after whom Mount Taygetus is named, and Zeus, according to Pausanias. Lacedaemon married Sparta and renamed the state after his wife. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. - Eurycrates ( Greek : Eurykrates ) was a king of the Greek city - state of Sparta , one of the Agiad ( also spelled Agiade ) kings , who was preceded by his father Polydorus and followed by his son Anaxander . He ruled from 665 to 640 BC. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - Anaxander or Anaxandros was the 12th Agiad dynasty King of Sparta (ruled c. 640-615 BC). - Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, and often referred to as the \\"Lion City\\" or the \\"Little Red Dot\\", is a sovereign city-state in Southeast Asia, and the world's only island city-state. It lies one degree (137 km) north of the equator, south of the southernmost tip of continental Asia and peninsular Malaysia, with Indonesia's Riau Islands to the south. Singapore's territory consists of a diamond-shaped main island along with 62 other islets. Since independence, extensive land reclamation has increased its total size by 23% (130 km), and its greening policy has covered the densely populated island with tropical flora, parks and gardens. - Monaco, officially the Principality of Monaco, is a sovereign city-state and microstate, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. France borders the country on three sides while the other side borders the Mediterranean Sea. Monaco has an area of and a population of about 37,800; it is the second smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. Monaco has a land border of , a coastline of , and a width that varies between . The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des Révoires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les Révoires \\"Ward\\", which is above sea level. Monaco's most populous \\"Quartier\\" is Monte Carlo and the most populous \\"Ward\\" is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by twenty percent. Monaco is known as a playground for the rich and famous, due to its tax laws. In 2014, it was noted about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires, more than in Zürich or Geneva. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Why might some graduates choose not to be attending school later in life? Possible A: detention, stupidity, overwhelmed, dropping out, much work Why is \\"much work\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"The answer \\"much work\\" is considered aligned with human common sense for a number of reasons. As people progress through life, their responsibilities, commitments, and personal goals may evolve, resulting in them having to allocate their time and energy differently. Let's delve deeper into how these factors might contribute to a graduate choosing to not pursue further education later in life: 1. Time constraints: As graduates enter the workforce, they might find themselves dedicating an increasing amount of time to their career. They may have a demanding job or be working towards career advancements and promotions that require their undivided attention. In such cases, taking on additional academic pursuits may not be feasible. 2. Financial commitments: Graduates may have economic responsibilities, such as mortgages, student loans, and providing for their family, which could limit their capacity to finance further education. Investing in additional schooling may not be a priority when considering their financial obligations. 3. Work-life balance: Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for mental and emotional well-being. Graduates who are already juggling work, personal relationships, and other aspects of everyday life may decide not to pursue higher education to maintain a balanced lifestyle. 4. Achieving career goals: Some graduates may have already achieved their desired career goals and do not see a need to pursue further education. If they believe their current level of education is sufficient for their chosen field, they might feel it's unnecessary to continue down the academic path. 5. Limited career benefits: People may evaluate the pros and cons of continuing their education at later stages in life. They might realize that not all academic qualifications lead to significant career advancements or additional income, thus deciding to invest their time and energy in other areas. 6. Shift in priorities: As people age, their priorities in life often change. This may include focusing on personal relationships, family life, travel, and other experiences. Investing time in education might not align with their current goals or desires. Taking all these factors into consideration, it's evident that \\"much work\\" as a response aligns with human common sense due to the various practical, financial, and personal reasons that might influence a graduate's decision not to attend school later in life. Their circumstances, responsibilities, and changing priorities create a complex situation in which further education may not be the preferred direction for them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In the interim came The Beatles, a double LP commonly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover. Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction: without Epstein's guiding presence, the group had briefly turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru. At his ashram in Rishikesh, India, a \\"Guide Course\\" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album. However, Starr left after only ten days, likening it to Butlins, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \\"Maharishi\\", renamed \\"Sexy Sadie\\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \\"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\\"During recording sessions for the White Album, which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968, relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, and McCartney took over the drum kit for \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" (on which Harrison and Lennon drummed as well) and \\"Dear Prudence\\". Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" he scorned as \\"granny music shit\\". Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the name of the church that is of red brick and Pevsner considered it \\"astonishingly restrained.\\" is inside the article: In 1859 Burges began work with Ambrose Poynter on the Maison Dieu, Dover, which was completed in 1861. Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife.

No Gold is not the correct answer to the question \\"_ is found in most molecules.\\" if we consider nitrogen to be found in most molecules. The element gold (Au) is a heavy metal and does not form an integral part of most molecules. Its occurrence in molecular structures is quite rare as compared to nitrogen. Nitrogen is an essential element found in a wide range of molecules, such as amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and it is a major component in the Earth's atmosphere (comprising approximately 78%). Nitrogen plays several roles in biological, chemical, and physical processes. It is a critical element for life on Earth. Gold, on the other hand, has fewer roles in biochemistry and is generally not found in most molecules. There are a few examples of gold-containing compounds used for specific applications, such as anti-cancer drugs, but these cases are quite rare. Due to its cost, chemical properties, and lack of usage in the structure and function of biological molecules, gold is not a common element found in most molecular formations.

Question: Information: - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. - Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868 December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868 February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory. - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada. - Amos Gager Throop (; 18111894) was a businessman and politician in Chicago, Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s. Most famously he was known for being a staunch abolitionist prior to the Civil War. In Chicago he lost two campaigns to be that city's mayor in 1852 and 1854. In both elections he was the nominee of the little-known Temperance Party, facing tough opposition from the Democratic Party. At the time of the Great Chicago Fire Amos was the city treasurer. He was instrumental in securing financing from New York to rebuild the wooden frontier town into a city of brick and mortar. Grateful Chicagoans renamed Main Street to Throop Street. Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888. - Wallace Leslie William Sargent FRS ( February 15 , 1935 -- October 29 , 2012 ) was a British - born American astronomer and the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Astronomy at California Institute of Technology . - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better. - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures. - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students. Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College. - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley. - Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866 June 3, 1936) was a U.S. chemist, inventor and educator. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán.

His father sold dry goods from door to door. (Dry goods include many different things; fabric , thread,scissors,combs,buttons,yarn,etc.) In 1845, his father died. All six children decided to go to the United States. Two of Strauss' bothers started a dry goods company in New York City. Strauss' sister Fanny and her husband started a similar business in San Francisco. Strauss decided to go to the southeastern part of the United States. For eight years, he walked along the country roads selling dry goods from door to door - just like his father in Bavaria. In 1853, Strauss decided to move to San Francisco.(At that time, thousands of people traveled to California to look for gold.)On the way to California, Strauss sold almost all of his dry goods. He had only one thing left-- some _ . In California, Strauss tried to sell the canvas to the gold miners . He said they could make tents from the canvas. But they weren't interested in canvas for tents. Strauss didn't know what to do with the canvas. Then, he had an idea. Strauss could see that the miners needed new pants. There were holes in their pants because the fabric wasn't strong. He decided to make the canvas into pants. They called them \\" _ \\". Later, Strauss stopped using canvas and used a different fabric. It was a heavy cotton fabric-- the same kind people wear today. Levi Strauss died in 1902. He never married and left his money to his nephews. He left the world much more -- the jeans that so many people wear.

You earn money. Then you use it to pay bills and taxes, donate some if you can and save some. I have paid out more than I earned in the past. I have been stingy occasionally and been sorry later. My biggest regret about money, however, is regarding savings. When I was 30 years old, I started saving money. Finally, I had a well-paid job with a salary that would grow with time and seniority. I purchased my home and moved in. The next logical step was to save money. So I did. In one year I put away 5,000. My goal was to build another 5,000 and start investing . I was pleased with my progress. Unfortunately, life stepped in. A family member became disabled and needed financial assistance. I could not seem to control my spending, and my checking account ran dry. My credit card bills rose. I carry no regret to any necessities that I bought for my family. However, as I look back, I realize that I did not research enough about balancing my budget before spending my savings account. I used the money to buy fast food just for convenience. I would go to the store for food when my cupboards were still not empty, because I wanted something special. I bought convenient items to save time, not considering that I was wasting money. I should have given up the name brand paper towels and used more dish rags. My 5,000 was gone quickly. That was just over 10 years ago.

I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

A son testified against his mother on Monday as she stood trial for the murder of his father who was shot dead at his home. Donna Horwitz, 66, has been charged with first-degree murder after she allegedly shot dead millionaire businessman and ex-husband Lanny Horwitz at the luxury home they once shared. The couple's son Radley Horwitz told the court in Palm Beach, Florida that he awoke at the house when he heard nine shots ring out and his mother screaming. Scroll down for video. Accused: Donna Horwitz, 66, in court this week in Palm Beach, Florida after she allegedly shot dead her estranged husband at their lavish home in 2011. Witness: Radley Horwitz gave evidence against his mother at her murder trial over the fatal shooting of his father Lanny. Mr Horwitz Jr, 38, found his father dying on the bathroom floor in a pool of blood and his mother near to the victim's naked body. An autopsy later revealed Mr Horwitz senior had multiple gunshot wounds to the torso and arms along with one shot fired directly in his mouth. Radley told the court on Monday: 'She [Donna] was screaming my name and she might have said ''your father, your father'' or something like that.' He added: 'He made this godawful, inhuman gurgling sound.' The Horwitzs, who had married twice and recently separated again, were reportedly having a furious row on the morning of September 30, 2011 at their home in the exclusive Admiral's Cove district of Jupiter. Lanny, a 66-year-old real estate attorney, had reportedly been packing for a weekend with a woman who was believed to be a girlfriend when he was killed. Slain: The body of Lanny Horwitz was found with nine gunshot wounds in the bathroom at his home in Admiral's Cove, Florida. According to WPBF, Radley said his father was 'sarcastic and belittling' and that his mother was deeply affected by how her treated her. It was also revealed at the trial, which began last Friday, that Radley harbored ill feelings towards his father and once owned a book on how to hire a hitman. Radley Horwitz and his father Lanny's financial affairs were in ruins at the time of the murder, the court heard and Radley stood to benefit from a 500,000 life insurance policy his father had taken out. He has denied killing his father. The defense have alleged that the 66-year-old businessman was shot either by his son or an unknown intruder. Bitter battle: Donna Horwitz had married her husband Lanny twice and the couple were separating for the second time when he was shot dead at his Florida home. Mrs Horwitz's attorney Grey Tesh said at the opening of the trial that DNA from a speck of blood was found on a gate outside the home which did not match the accused. As the prosecution brought in final witnesses today, a police detective told the jury that Mrs Horwitz had hoped for a reconciliation with her husband and was in complete despair that he seemed to be leaving her for someone else. Detective Eric Frank read from Mrs Horwitz's journal, where she wrote: 'My heart is broken and he is working on my mind, playing games with me' according to the Palm Beach Post. The jury is expected to hear closing arguments tomorrow morning. Crime scene: The Horwitzs' luxury home in Admiral's Cove, Jupiter where 66-year-old Lanny was found murdered in September 2011.

Beyond the table, as if turned to stone by this culminating horror of revelation, stood Aline. M. de La Tour d'Azyr was the first to stir. Into his bewildered mind came the memory of something that Mme. de Plougastel had said of a letter that was on the table. He came forward, unhindered. The announcement made, Mme. de Plougastel no longer feared the sequel, and so she let him go. He walked unsteadily past this new-found son of his, and took up the sheet that lay beside the candlebranch. A long moment he stood reading it, none heeding him.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Immigrants from Nepal and Burma grow into own Census category Bishnu Pradhan and his friend Aaron Acharya (l.) are part of a growing Burmese… (John Taggart for News ) Burmese, Bhutanese and Nepalese immigrants are flocking to Queens in such large numbers that they've earned their own separate categories in the U.S. Census count. Breaking out from the \\"Other Asian\\" grouping, these South Asian residents have planted roots throughout the city, together quadrupling in size over the past decade. \\"In Queens, there's a fast-growing South Asian community,\\" said Howard Shih, the Census programs director for the Asian American Federation advocacy group, which recently released a report. \\"Once there's a core immigrant group, you start drawing more people.\\" In 2000, the \\"Other Asian\\" category included fewer than 2,000 Queens residents but has since skyrocketed to more than 7,000 in the 2010 count - including 240 Bhutanese, 2,132 Burmese and 4,930 Nepalese. The actual numbers may also be much higher due to undercounting, experts said. These three groups are concentrated in Sunnyside, Maspeth, Elmhurst, Woodside and Jackson Heights, according to the Asian American Federation. \\"Because of the way the U.S. has grouped everyone together, the South Asian community has often been less visible,\\" said Seema Agnani, executive director of Chhaya Community Development Corp., a South Asian housing group in Queens. Recognition through new categories is significant, said Bishnu Pradhan, 40, a Woodside resident formerly on the board of the Association of Bhutanese in America. \\"It's important for us to have a separate category, rather than be lumped into one,\\" said Pradhan, an accountant. \\"The population of the Bhutanese will grow.\\" Like many Bhutanese immigrants who end up in Queens, Pradhan is a refugee who originally moved to Nepal from Bhutan, a small South Asian country in the Himalayas. Pradhan was one of the first from Bhutan in the borough in 1998, he said, adding that he has seen the population grow. \\"In Queens, because there are people from several South Asian countries, they feel like they are at home,\\" he said. \\"We have a lot of people from Nepal and India who are already established in the Queens area,\\" said Ravi Gurung, a Bhutanese resident of Woodside, who moved to Queens 12 years ago. \\"Every corner, we find someone we can talk with.\\" Pema Dorji, a 35-year-old Woodside resident from Bhutan, said it was an important step for him to come to Queens - and he's glad the Census Bureau is recognizing that. \\"My dream was to be here,\\" said Dorji, who works for a shipping company. \\"I'm very proud to be Bhutanese. We are a small country, but we are known in the world.\\" Summary:","completion":"The United States Census Bureau has recognized the significant increase in Burmese, Bhutanese, and Nepalese immigrants by including them as separate categories instead of the previous \\"Other Asian\\" grouping. The number of such residents in Queens, New York, has quadrupled over the last decade, moving from under 2000 in 2000 to over 7000 in the 2010 census, including 240 Bhutanese, 2132 Burmese, and 4930 Nepalese. Experts claim that the numbers might be even higher due to undercounting. Neighborhoods such as Sunnyside, Maspeth, Elmhurst, Woodside, and Jackson Heights have seen a concentration of these three groups. The Asian American Federation has noted this pattern, supporting the argument that when a core immigrant group is established, more people are attracted to the area. Advocates for the South Asian community have praised this decision, stating it adds visibility to their community.

Write a summary based on this article: Math Bee: Honeybees Seem To Understand The Notion Of Zero Enlarge this image toggle caption Don Farrall/Getty Images Don Farrall/Getty Images Honeybees understand that \\"nothing\\" can be \\"something\\" that has numerical meaning, showing that they have a primitive grasp of the concept of zero. That's according to a newly published study in Science, which shows that bees possess a mathematical ability once thought to exist only in dolphins, primates, birds and humans who are beyond the preschool years. \\"This is quite amazing, in my view, that bees can really do it,\\" says Andreas Nieder, a scientist who studies how animals' process the idea of \\"nothing\\" and was not part of the research team. He says zero was discovered relatively recently in human history, and was essential in the development of both mathematics and science. \\"It's a hard and very abstract concept,\\" Nieder says. \\"It is a sort of eccentric uncle in the number family.\\" Previous experiments have shown that honeybees have some facility with numbers, because they were able to count landmarks as they foraged around for a sweet reward. But in these tests, the insects couldn't count very high — only to about four. Still, that made a team of researchers in Australia and France want to explore what else the bees could do with numbers. Scarlett Howard at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, lured bees to a wall where they were presented with two square cards. Each card had a different number of black symbols, such as dots or triangles. Howard trained one group of bees to understand that sugar water would always be located under the card with the least number of symbols. \\"They could come and see two circles versus three circles, or four triangles versus one triangle, or something like that,\\" she explains. The bees quickly learned to fly to the card with the fewest symbols, an impressive feat. But then they got another test: The researchers presented the bees with a card that had a single symbol — and a blank card that had nothing on it. The bees seemed to understand that \\"zero\\" was less than one, because they flew toward the blank card more often than you'd expect if they were choosing at random — although they weren't that good at distinguishing between the two. It got easier for them when they had to compare zero with a larger number. \\"When we showed them zero versus six, they did that at a much higher level than zero versus one,\\" Howard says. \\"So what tells us is that they consider zero as an actual quantity along the number line. They're actually better at doing zero versus six because those two numbers are further apart.\\" \\"We were very surprised and happy, excited, to see that actually the bees were choosing the empty paper,\\" says Aurore Avargues-Weber, a CNRS researcher with the University of Toulouse. Even very young children, she points out, have trouble understanding that zero is a number. \\"It's easy for them to count 'one, two, three, four,' but zero, it's nothing, it's not something to count. So it's not the same category,\\" she explains. She had expected that the bees would see a blank paper as something irrelevant that was completely different than what they had been trained on, because to understand zero, \\"brains need to represent something out of nothing. It's not trivial.\\" What's more, the brains of bees are incredibly tiny brains compared with the brains of humans, Nieder notes. \\"Bees really have a mini-brain with fewer than one million brain cells,\\" he says, \\"compared to 86 billion nerve cells in our brain.\\" Even so, the bees can understand the abstract concept of an empty set — the precursor or prerequisite to understanding the symbolic number zero — and he says he found that very surprising. ||||| Trained to pick the lowest number out of a series of options, a honeybee chooses a blank image, revealing an understanding of the concept of zero. Credit: RMIT University Scientists have discovered honeybees can understand the concept of zero, putting them in an elite club of clever animals that can grasp the abstract mathematical notion of nothing. By demonstrating that even tiny brains can comprehend complex, abstract concepts, the surprise finding opens possibilities for new, simpler approaches to developing Artificial Intelligence. In research published in the journal Science, Australian and French researchers tested whether honey bees can rank numerical quantities and understand that zero belongs at the lower end of a sequence of numbers. Associate Professor Adrian Dyer, from RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, said the number zero was the backbone of modern maths and technological advancements. \\"Zero is a difficult concept to understand and a mathematical skill that doesn't come easily—it takes children a few years to learn,\\" Dyer said. \\"We've long believed only humans had the intelligence to get the concept, but recent research has shown monkeys and birds have the brains for it as well. \\"What we haven't known—until now—is whether insects can also understand zero.\\" As well as being a critical pollinator, the honeybee is an exceptional model species for investigating insect cognition, with previous research showing they can learn intricate skills from other bees and even understand abstract concepts like sameness and difference.

Credit: RMIT University But bee brains have fewer than 1 million neurons—compared with the 86,000 million neurons of a human brain—and little was known about how insect brains would cope with being tested on such an important numeric skill. RMIT Ph.D. researcher Scarlett Howard set out to test the honeybee on its understanding, marking individual honeybees for easy identification and luring them to a specially-designed testing apparatus. The bees were trained to choose an image with the lowest number of elements in order to receive a reward of sugar solution. For example, the bees learned to choose three elements when presented with three vs. four; or two elements when presented with two vs. three. When Howard periodically tested the bees with an image that contained no elements versus an image that had one or more, the bees understood that the set of zero was the lower number—despite never having been exposed to an \\"empty set\\".

Credit: Composite image by Scarlett Howard, Jair Garcia and Adrian Dyer Dyer, a researcher in the Bio Inspired Digital Sensing-Lab (BIDS-Lab) in RMIT's Digital Ethnography Research Centre, said the findings opened the door to new understandings of how different brains could represent zero. \\"This is a tricky neuroscience problem,\\" he said. \\"It is relatively easy for neurons to respond to stimuli such as light or the presence of an object but how do we, or even an insect, understand what nothing is? \\"How does a brain represent nothing? Could bees and other animals that collect lots of food items, have evolved special neural mechanisms to enable the perception of zero? \\"If bees can learn such a seemingly advanced maths skill that we don't even find in some ancient human cultures, perhaps this opens the door to considering the mechanism that allows animals and ourselves to understand the concept of nothing.\\" An individually marked honeybee inspects stimuli with either 3 or 4 elements before choosing to land on the correct “lower” number. After learning this type of rule with many combinations, bees understand that an unfamiliar presentation of an empty set is less than any other number of elements presented. Credit: Scarlett Howard One of the problems in the development of artificial intelligence is enabling robots to operate in very complex environments, Dyer said. \\"Crossing a road is simple for adult humans, we understand if there are no approaching cars, no bikes or trams, then it is probably ok to cross,\\" he said. \\"But what is zero, how do we represent this for so many complex object classes to make decisions in complex environments? \\"If bees can perceive zero with a brain of less than a million neurons, it suggests there are simple efficient ways to teach AI new tricks.\\" The research was conducted in both Australia and France and involved many control experiments to validate the findings. Study co-author, Dr. Aurore Avarguès-Weber from the University of Toulouse in France, said: \\"The discovery that bees can show such elaborated understanding of numbers was really surprising given their tiny brain.\\" \\"Large brains are thus not necessary to play with numbers. This capacity is therefore probably shared by many other animals.\\" The paper \\"Numerical ordering of zero in honeybees\\" is published in Science today.

Howard el al., \\"Numerical ordering of zero in honey bees,\\" Science (2018). science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi … 1126/science.aar4975 ||||| Understanding zero It has been said that the development of an understanding of zero by society initiated a major intellectual advance in humans, and we have been thought to be unique in this understanding. Although recent research has shown that some other vertebrates understand the concept of the “empty set,” Howard et al. now show that an understanding of this concept is present in untrained honey bees (see the Perspective by Nieder). This finding suggests that such an understanding has evolved independently in distantly related species that deal with complexity in their environments, and that it may be more widespread than previously appreciated. Science, this issue p. 1124; see also p. 1069 ||||| Humans aren't the only species that can ponder abstract mathematical concepts like nonexistence. In addition to some other animals, honeybees understand that the number zero is less than 1, according to a new study. Dolphins, African gray parrots and nonhuman primates also understand the idea of \\"zero,\\" but researchers were surprised to find that honeybees also comprehend this concept, considering the insects' tiny brains, according to a statement from RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. Honeybees have fewer than 1 million neurons, compared with the 86 billion neurons in humans — and yet, they grasp a concept that humans, by some measures, don't start to understand before preschool, according to NPR. The researchers set up two cards, each of which had a set of symbols on them, like triangles or circles. Then, they trained a group of the bees to fly to the card with the lower number of symbols. (The bees quickly learned what the humans wanted them to do to get their delicious, sugary rewards). The trained bees were then shown a card that was empty versus one that had symbols on it. Without any prior training, the bees flew more often to the empty card — thereby demonstrating that they understood that \\"zero\\" was a number less than the others, according to the study, which was published Thursday (June 7) in the journal Science. Although they flew more often to an empty card than to one that had one symbol on it, it became easier for them to differentiate when the symbols' card increased in number. For example, they more often flew to the zero when the other card had four symbols than when it had one, according to NPR. Perhaps these findings will shed light on the brain mechanism behind what allows us to understand the concept of \\"nothing,\\" Adrian Dyer, a researcher at RMIT University and senior author of the study, said in the RMIT statement. This understanding, in turn, could help in the development of artificial intelligence that also understands this concept. \\"If bees can perceive zero with a brain of less than a million neurons, it suggests there are simple, efficient ways to teach AI new tricks,\\" Dyer said in the statement.

Here are possible answers to this question: - expensive - wolf - wool - goat - lamb I believe the correct choice is \\"expensive\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"When you go to buy a sheep, you will learn that it is \\"expensive.\\" Here's why: Sheep are considered expensive for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, the cost of a sheep can be high, depending on its breed, age, and purpose. Purebred sheep and those bred for specific purposes, such as wool production or meat, can carry a significantly higher price tag. Additionally, some sheep breeds are rare or have special characteristics, which can also increase their price. Another factor that contributes to the expense of owning a sheep is the cost of maintenance and care. Sheep require a proper diet, which includes quality hay, grains, and clean water. They also may need supplements or mineral blocks, depending on their specific needs. The cost of these resources can add up over time. Adequate space and suitable shelter are also essential for keeping sheep healthy and comfortable. Providing enough fenced land can be an expensive investment, as well as securing proper housing that offers protection against the elements and potential predators. Sheep are also susceptible to a range of health issues and diseases, which can lead to veterinary costs. Regular check-ups, vaccinations, and preventative treatments are important for maintaining their health but can be expensive. Furthermore, sheep need regular shearing, hoof trimming, and other forms of care that may require the service of professionals, adding to the overall cost of ownership. In summary, when you go to buy a sheep, you will learn that it is expensive due to the initial purchase price, the cost of food and supplies, the need for appropriate space and shelter, and the array of health and maintenance costs that come with owning a sheep."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House.

Această politică a avut ca rezultat exodul a numeroși non-musulmani, în principal creștini și evrei, care au fost supuși unor presiuni și discriminări.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Avoid drastic measures that could cause rapid weight loss in your cat. This could lead to a serious liver condition called hepatic lipidosis, where excess fat that is broken down accumulates in the liver. This makes your cat feel ill and decreases his appetite, setting up a vicious cycle of more body fat breakdown and fat accumulating in the liver. If you suspect your cat has hepatic lipidosis, get your cat prompt medical treatment at a veterinary hospital. It's a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. Overweight cats are more likely to develop diabetes, where the body doesn't create or manage insulin and blood sugar levels properly. If a cat develops diabetes, it may be manageable through gradual weight loss and a high-protein diet alone, while other cats will need daily insulin injections by their owners for the rest of their life. Obese cats are also at risk to develop painful osteoarthritis due to years of excess weight stressing the bones and joints. In addition, they are at risk of developing high blood pressure, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. Obese and overweight cats have a tendency to be less energetic, sleep more, and have fewer interactions with their families. This is how they get the reputation of being fat and lazy. The vet will do a thorough examination to make sure there are no underlying health issues. The vet can then guide you on to the type and amount of food you should feed your cat. You'll also be told how much weight your cat should lose each month and how much weight he should lose overall. Your vet will probably recommend that your cat lose a quarter pound a week or one pound a month, depending on your cat's frame, size, breed, and sex. You may want to get a measuring cup with 1/8th measure increments. This will help measure the appropriate amount of food for your cat. Look for commercial cat foods that are high in fiber and can be fed \\"as-is\\" or mix 1 to 2 teaspoons of a powdered fiber supplement into wet food. You can also feed 1 to 2 tablespoons of canned plain pumpkin to add fiber to a regular diet. If you add powdered fiber or pumpkin instead of the commercial high-fiber food, cut back on the amount of cat food by 1 to 2 tablespoons at the same time. If you're having trouble getting your cat to eat the less flavorful high-fiber food, add a little water that's been drained off of a can of tuna. This can entice your cat to eat it. Fiber is an important form of carbohydrate that will take a while for your cat to digest, making him feel fuller without contributing too many calories. High-fiber foods will give important nutrients and keep your cat from eating too many calories. Look for a commercially prepared high-protein food or have a trained pet nutritionist create a homemade diet for your cat. This is important because cats need the amino acid taurine in their diets or they'll develop heart and vision problems. While high-protein foods are generally tastier for cats, they might not be as filling or satisfying to a cat used to eating more food. Note that a cat with kidney disease should not be placed on a high protein diet since it will further damage the kidneys. If you do chose to gradually switch cat food, do so over a period of one to two weeks. The first two days mix ¼ new food with ¾ old food. The next four days mix ½ new food with ½ old food. The next 2 to 4 days mix ¾ new food with ¼ old food. If the cat leaves the old food in the dish, make a more gradual transition to the new food. If he absolutely refuses the new food consult your veterinarian for advice. You might try keeping your cat's regular food, just offering a smaller portion. Use the measuring cup to measure out the recommended amount on the cat food label and feed that amount. If it's more than what your cat normally eats, cut down accordingly, since some manufacturers are fairly generous in their serving sizes. A good rule of thumb is to decrease the amount of food fed by 10%. It is important to understand that if your cat was used to having food available to eat at all times, you will need to begin feeding your cat two or three times a day. Since your cat has been overeating, you need to control feeding times. Before starting your cat on a diet, write down your cat's weight on a calendar or notebook. Weigh your cat every week while he's dieting. It's easy to do this by holding your cat in your arms, stepping on a bathroom scale and then weighing yourself after you place the cat down. Subtract this number from your first number to give you your cat’s weight. Remember the goal is for your cat to lose no more than ¼ pound a week or 1 pound a month. If you find after two weeks that no weight has been lost, cut down portion sizes by 10%. If your cat still hasn't lost weight after 2 more weeks, talk again with your veterinarian.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money? from the following article ? The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758.

This decision, which has been lauded by human rights organizations and peace advocates from around the world, is a significant step towards building a safer and more just global society. Landmines have long been a scourge to humanity, causing devastating harm to thousands of innocent civilians every year, particularly in war-torn regions. It is unfortunate that, despite efforts to mitigate their impact, these cruel devices continue to plague communities even after the conflicts have subsided. The European Union's decision to impose an outright ban on the export of landmines aims to target the root of this issue, significantly reducing the number of devices available for use. The European Union's bold move to outlaw the export of landmines underscores its commitment to preventing their proliferation and usage around the globe. This reflects the EU's dedication to respecting humanitarian principles and preserving peace, while protecting the fundamental human rights of those most vulnerable to the lethal effects of these weapons. Additionally, it is critical to note that the recent ban on landmine exports is just one aspect of the EU's broader strategy to deter the production, acquisition, and trade of military assets that can inflict colossal damage to innocent lives. Some key factors contributing to the decision of the EU to impose this ban include increased public awareness surrounding the deadly effects of landmines, the desire to embrace a more sustainable approach to preserving global security and stability, and the willingness to adhere to international norms and treaties. The 1997 Ottawa Treaty, also known as the Mine Ban Treaty, specifically calls for the absolute prohibition of the use, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines, and has been ratified by a majority of world nations. The European Union's recent move signifies its complete adherence to the provisions outlined in this treaty. This major development comes at a time when the world is grappling with pressing security challenges, such as armed conflict, terrorism, and organized crime. In this context, the European Union's ban on the export of landmines sends a powerful message of unity and solidarity, demonstrating that their member states are determined to confront these challenges and ensure a more humane and secure environment for everyone. As part of this initiative, the EU is also committed to funding and supporting demining operations worldwide. By offering assistance in the form of finance, education, and technical expertise, the European Union aims to dismantle existing landmines and help affected communities heal from their tragic consequences. In conclusion, the European Union's bold and historic decision to ban the export of anti-personnel landmines marks a significant step in the global effort to eradicate these deadly weapons. It is crucial that other nations follow suit and collaborate to put an end to the landmine menace once and for all. This multifaceted approach, which combines stringent controls on landmine production and exports along with comprehensive support for demining efforts worldwide, is an exemplary model for how the global community can join forces to safeguard innocent lives and create a more peaceful world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Amy pointed out the pleiades star cluster to Megan because","completion":"it was the first time Megan had shown interest in learning about the celestial objects in the night sky. The Pleiades star cluster, also known as the Seven Sisters, M45, or even Subaru in Japanese, is one of the most easily identifiable and well-known star clusters visible to the naked eye. The enthusiasm in Megan's eyes shone just as brightly as the stars, and this sight, Amy knew, would truly captivate her newfound interest. The Pleiades star cluster is located in the constellation of Taurus, approximately 444 light-years away from Earth. It is a prominent sight in the winter sky of the Northern Hemisphere and can be found by first identifying the familiar constellation of Orion. From Orion's belt, a line extending through the bright star Aldebaran (also part of Taurus) leads directly to this enchanting cluster. Amy began by explaining the mythology behind the Pleiades, which varies across different cultures. The most common story is derived from Greek mythology, which tells of the seven sisters pursued by the hunter Orion, who were transformed into doves by Zeus and placed in the night sky to escape his advances. She then went on to describe the scientific nature of the star cluster. Formed from the same cosmic cloud around 100 million years ago, Pleiades consists mainly of young, hot, blue-white stars, which have yet to exhaust their reserves of hydrogen fuel. Despite being referred to as the Seven Sisters, the star cluster contains over 800 stars, but only a handful are visible to the naked eye. The apparent member stars are Alcyone, Atlas, Electra, Maia, Merope, Taygeta, and Pleione, with each name rooted in the Greek mythology Amy had previously mentioned. Amy also shared her knowledge about the nebulosity surrounding the Pleiades star cluster, which is composed of fine dust particles that reflect the radiant blue light from the stars. These dust particles are the remnants of the vast molecular cloud that birthed the stars, and the ongoing interaction between the stars and dust creates the glowing phenomenon observed in long-exposure photographs. As Amy conveyed her passion for astronomy to Megan, they both marveled at the indigo splendor of the Pleiades star cluster in the crisp winter sky. They discussed its importance in ancient cultures, as it was often used as a celestial calendar and a reference point for navigation. The two young women stood there, immersed in their newfound celestial bond, as each star of the Pleiades twinkled back at them like a sisterhood traversing space and time. With each minute spent beneath the cold but captivating night sky, Megan became more and more awestruck by the magnificence of the stars. Amy shared more fascinating astronomical facts and folklore, delving deeper into the history and science that enveloped them on that crystal-clear night. Thus began Megan's lifelong interest in astronomy, initiated by her first enchanting encounter with the Pleiades star cluster. And as future celestial events unfolded, like meteor showers, eclipses, and planetary conjunctions, Megan and Amy would come together many times more, united by their love for the cosmos and the unending desire to learn and explore its secrets. It became a ritual for them, a reminder of the night their friendship had grown stronger under the spell of the Seven Sisters. Together, they fostered a love for mankind's earliest obsession: understanding the wonders and mysteries written in the ever-expanding tome that is the night sky."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Where might he go to do so? Options: A. hen house B. painting C. virginia D. california E. lion's den","completion":"The most logical option in line with common sense for George to pursue his interest in hunting foxes would be option C: Virginia. If we evaluate each option, we can deduce the following: A. Hen House: A hen house is primarily meant for keeping chickens or hens and providing a place for them to lay eggs. It would be an unlikely place to find foxes, as they would prey on the chickens and probably be deterred from the area by the owners. B. Painting: A painting is a piece of visual artwork, and therefore, it cannot provide a physical location for George to hunt foxes. He could admire an image of fox hunting in a painting, but it doesn't serve the purpose of finding a real-life location to hunt. C. Virginia: Virginia is a state located in the southeastern United States, known for its diverse landscapes, natural habitats, and wildlife. The state is home to a variety of wildlife species, including foxes, making it a plausible location for George to partake in fox hunting. Hunting foxes is a traditional rural activity in Virginia, and the state has designated hunting seasons and regulations to manage the fox population. D. California: Although California is known for its diverse wildlife and various ecosystems, it is less commonly associated with fox hunting compared to Virginia. While it might be possible for George to hunt foxes here, it wouldn't necessarily be the best option when compared to Virginia's rich fox hunting heritage and established hunting practices. E. Lion's Den: A lion's den refers to the dwelling of lions and can also be a metaphor for a dangerous or hostile environment. This would be an unlikely place for George to hunt foxes, as lions and foxes typically reside in different habitats and geographical locations. Additionally, the presence of lions would imply a more dangerous environment for George and may deter him from entering to hunt foxes. In conclusion, based on the available options, the most sensible choice for George to pursue his interest in hunting foxes would be Virginia. The state is known for its diverse wildlife, including foxes, and is more commonly linked to fox hunting tradition. It provides an appropriate environment with established hunting practices, regulations, and seasons that would likely allow George the best opportunity to partake in his preferred activity."},{"prompt":"Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the scientific name of the kongoni?, using the article: The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years., what would be the answer ?

Summarize: Understanding the problem is the first step in moving forward. Don’t feel bad about having a crush; crushes are something that everyone experiences at some point of view and the human brain is actually biologically programmed to fall in love. Getting over a relationship is hard, even if that relationship never fully materialized. Give yourself some time to mope around and feel badly, then pick yourself up and move forward. Make sure you're not upset for too long. While feeling sad, also take steps to comfort yourself. Try taking a hot shower, listening to one of your favorite playlists and speaking nicely to yourself. Knowing that this relationship will never progress is an important step in moving past it. Remind yourself again and again that what you’re doing is necessary for your own personal happiness and growth. Remember that you will have other crushes. In many people's minds, having a crush on your teacher veers towards the inappropriate sector, no matter how you feel. It is against the law to be with someone over 18 if you are under 18. There will be others who you will prefer in the future, and others who you have a real chance with.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"In order to determine a more sound solution for removing pet hair from furniture and clothes based on naive physics reasoning, we need to consider the primary factor ingrained in naive physics: common sense understanding and experiences rather than scientific explanations. Here, I will present and analyze both the solutions: Solution 1: Using a Lint Roller or Tape A lint roller is designed specifically to remove hair, lint, and other debris from fabrics and surfaces. The roller has a sticky adhesive layer that efficiently picks up pet hair when rolled over the surface of the furniture or clothes. The effectiveness of the lint roller is based on its adhesive properties and how well it can capture the hair. The use of a lint roller requires physical effort, but it is easy to manipulate and control on varied surfaces. Additionally, tape can serve a similar purpose, especially if wrapped around your hand with the sticky side out. Pressing it against the fabric picks-up pet hair effectively. Solution 2: Using a Vacuum Cleaner with a Brush Attachment A vacuum cleaner is an electric device that uses suction to remove dust or debris from surfaces. Most vacuum cleaners come with a brush attachment, which is designed specifically to pick up hair and other deeply embedded dirt from upholstery, furniture, carpets, or clothing. The system works by agitation caused by the bristles and a strong suction force to lift the hair from the surface. Using a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment is effective, easy to use, and often more time-efficient for larger areas. However, it might also require electricity and proper maintenance of the vacuum cleaner (e.g. cleaning the filters and emptying the bin). After analyzing both solutions, I would conclude that Solution 2 - Using a Vacuum Cleaner with a Brush Attachment, is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. The rationale behind this choice is based on common everyday experiences, it covers the practicality of usage, efficiency, and ability to tackle larger areas in less time. It also takes into account the effectiveness of combining the agitation caused by brush bristles and the suction power provided by the vacuum cleaner. Nevertheless, the choice of the ideal solution depends on individual preferences, availability of resources, and specific situations. A lint roller or tape might be a better choice for quick fixes, spot cleaning, or smaller surfaces, while a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment works better for overall cleanliness and deep cleaning of larger areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

Carrie bought two parcels of farmland. The Northern one had soil with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the Southern parcel had almost no traces of AM fungi. Hint: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions.

It has broad authority to review the activities of various Agencies and programs, examining all facets of government, from evaluating the effectiveness of policy implementation to financial management practices. The management reforms of the 1990s aimed to improve government performance, a task that required a considerable amount of investigation, data collection, and reporting by the GAO. Therefore, it can be deduced that the GAO has, and continues to, provide a large amount of essential information. This information plays a crucial role as it contributes to improving the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of government agencies and programs. It supports the work of policymakers and legislators who rely on accurate, thorough, and unbiased information to make informed decisions. In summary, the Government Accountability Office not only provides a great deal of necessary information but also ensures it is effectively disseminated to those who need it, such as congressional committees tasked with government oversight. This helps sustain government accountability and operational efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

She is then transferred from her new gaoler, Sir Ralph Sadler, to Sheffield, which is located in Derbyshire. After that, she is transferred to Tutbury. The sequence of events is as follows: 1.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: During the seasons of fine weather, kids can play outside, happy and active. But when winter comes around, it is wet, windy and cold. Since they can't go outside to play, kids get restless and miserable. Fun activities for kids are pretty much necessary at that time of year, and they need to be kept entertained. One way to do this is to have an indoor treasure hunt, where children can look for clues and then get to the treasure. Treasure doesn't even need to be much, because just the activity is fun enough. Art activities are always fun, and if you start off with some paper in different colors they can draws shapes on the back, cut them out and stick them on the white paper to make all sorts of things. Cardboard boxes, stuck together and then painted, can be made into buildings or robots. You can keep all boxes in a bag in the loft. Then you have something you can draw on when the weather is bad and the children need to play indoors. Dressing up is another fun indoor activity. Why not read a book to them and then ask them to act it for you? That can keep them busy and develop their imagination. When you encourage children to use their imagination, you are giving them confidence in themselves, in their own creative abilities; by suggesting they put on a play you are encouraging them to work together and develop teamwork skills. The best way to help your kids have fun when it is rainy outside is to let them come up with some ideas. When you feel that they are old enough, let them write their ideas on a piece of paper and you can pick an idea that you find practical. That way, every day can be fun! Answer:","completion":"Which of the following indoor activities is suggested in the article as a fun way to keep children entertained during the winter season?

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Counter-Attack Context: In 1942, both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union are gathering forces and supplies in one particular sector of the Eastern Front for a major attack. The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man. An eighth German soldier, thought to be dead, wakes up and attacks. In the struggle, the lone lantern is extinguished and Elenko is stabbed in the shoulder. However, Kulkov kills him and regains control of the situation. Oddly, Elenko is certain that one of the Germans tried to help her in the darkness. Kulkov decides to try a ploy. He orders the magician to go around the corner of the main room out of sight of the others. He knocks the German out and then fires one round, making the rest think he has exacted... The answer is:","completion":"In the movie Counter-Attack, Germany and the Soviet Union are gathering forces and supplies in a particular sector of the Eastern Front, where the Soviets are secretly constructing an underwater bridge at night over a river. The location is not explicitly mentioned, and thus it is difficult to provide more specific details on the region. Both the German and Soviet forces are preparing for a major attack in this area, which eventually leads to the significant events that take place throughout the movie. The primary focus of the film's plot is the operation led by Colonel Semenov to discover Germany's battle plans. His strategy involves deploying a paratrooper unit, including Alexei Kulkov, behind enemy lines to attack a German divisional headquarters and capture an officer for interrogation. With the aid of local partisans and their guide, Lisa Elenko, the paratroopers successfully infiltrate the German headquarters and engage with the enemy forces. During the subsequent battles and skirmishes that occur, Kulkov manages to take seven Germans as prisoners while being trapped in the cellar of a building that collapses due to an artillery strike. By questioning the captive Germans, Kulkov attempts to identify any disguised officers among them. He believes that one of them is secretly an officer based on the possession of a pistol and monocle. As the film progresses, Kulkov employs various tactics to obtain crucial information on the German plans for attack. These efforts include interrogating the captives, using their unique skills to his advantage, and manipulating the situation to gain their trust. Amidst this tense standoff, Kulkov eventually unveils a significant discovery – one of the Germans might have attempted to help Elenko during a scuffle in the dark. The movie Counter-Attack offers an intense and engaging look into the high-stakes battles and espionage activities that transpired between Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II. While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact location of their troop buildup and supply gathering based on the film's narrative, the Eastern Front sector serves as the backdrop for the unfolding drama and suspense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - office suite - his textbook - binder - math class - notebook The rationale to choose \\"notebook\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The rationale to choose \\"notebook\\" as the answer to this question is based on the function and purpose of a divider and the context provided. When James put a divider between arithmetic and English, this action essentially helped him separate and organize the content of these two different subjects. By doing this, he could continue using the same resource efficiently while distinguishing one subject from another. Now, let's examine the given choices in-depth and understand why \\"notebook\\" is the most appropriate answer: 1. Office suite: An office suite is a collection of productivity software, including applications like word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation software. While they are useful tools, they don't precisely fit the context provided in the question. 2. His textbook: A textbook is typically a resource specifically dedicated to a particular subject, which means it already has a built-in segregation of content for each subject. Moreover, textbooks don't usually allow adding dividers since their content is fixed. Therefore, this choice is not the most suitable answer in this situation. 3. Binder: A binder is a possible option because it can hold multiple subjects' notes and has the flexibility to add dividers. However, the context given in the question is more suggestive of using an existing resource, rather than merely segregating subjects. While the binder could be an answer, there is a more fitting option available. 4. Math class: This choice seems unrelated to the context provided. The question deals with organizing different subjects' content rather than the act of attending a class. Thus, math class is not an appropriate answer. 5. Notebook: Finally, a notebook serves as a resource that allows students to take notes and record their learning across various subjects. When James uses a divider between arithmetic and English, he can organize the material more effectively and continue taking notes in the same notebook without confusing the information from the two subjects. This choice fits the context provided perfectly and considers the function of a divider. In summary, the rationale to choose \\"notebook\\" as the answer is due to the fact that it's more aligned with the context of segregating subjects' content and continues using the same resource. It also takes into account the purpose of a divider and how it can help keep information organized and manageable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This statement refers to a proposal that is consistent with the principles set forth by the International Organization for Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is a worldwide association of national securities regulatory agencies. These principles provide a global framework for the regulation and oversight of financial benchmarks, aimed at ensuring their integrity, reliability, and fairness. The proposal in question covers an extensive range of benchmarks, demonstrating its comprehensiveness. It does not merely focus on interest rate benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is a widely-used benchmark interest rate that indicates the borrowing costs for major banks in the London market. Over the years, LIBOR has been subject to manipulation and scandal, leading to an increased need for regulatory reform and enhanced oversight. In addition to interest rate benchmarks, the proposal also encompasses commodity benchmarks. Commodity benchmarks are essential for various industries, as they provide a means to determine the market price for specific commodities like oil, gold, and agricultural products. These benchmarks serve as a reference point for pricing commodity-related financial instruments, such as futures contracts and options. Including both interest rate benchmarks and commodity benchmarks in the proposal illustrates its wide-ranging scope and its aim to address potential issues and manipulations in multiple areas of the financial market.

While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than 14,000 kilometres (8,700Â mi) in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to court as many women as will fall for his pick-up lines.

During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the \\"haves\\" (to which they belong) and the \\"have-nots\\" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by traveling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their communist beliefs. In a fire-lit scene, Guevara and Granado ashamedly admit to the couple that they are not out looking for work as well. The duo then accompanies the couple to the Chuquicamata copper mine, where Guevara becomes angry at the treatment of the workers. The Daily Telegraph remarked that \\"the scenes at Machu Picchu are worth watching several times over.\\"[5][6] However, it is a...

Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court.
