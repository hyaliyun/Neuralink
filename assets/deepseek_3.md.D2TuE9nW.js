Write highlights for this article: After Marco Rubio won his inaugural Senate race in 2010 in Florida, he became the latest star of the Republican Party. The young, insurgent candidate was so impressive, talk of a presidential future quickly ensued. He entered the Senate with high expectations, having won his race with the support of the new tea party movement while simultaneously appealing to mainstream conservatives. But his journey has not been without roadblocks. Leadership on controversial topics has slowed his rise. Now, Rubio, 43, is working to right his perceived wrongs and shed his stereotypes as takes up the mantle once adorned by doing the work to launch a presidential run. Boosting his presence. The freshman senator is doing all the things necessary to make himself known. He's traveling to early presidential nominating states, heading overseas to beef up his foreign policy credentials, appearing on national TV to boost his name recognition and formulating policy ideas to demonstrate substance. On Wednesday, he delivered a \\"major address\\" on economic mobility and challenges facing the middle class. Little new came from it. It was a culmination of previously announced ideas and legislation he's already introduced this year and weaved in personal stories of childhood poverty as the son of Cuban immigrants and accounts of people struggling to make it in the middle class. \\"Too many are starting to believe the American Dream is no longer possible for people like them,\\" he said. Alex Conant, Rubio's spokesman, said the senator has been developing these ideas \\"for months,\\" since the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty earlier this year. It's a comprehensive speech but one that could be delivered on the floor of the Senate, a place where any of the 100 members go to offer their policy prescriptions. Instead, Rubio's speech was aimed at garnering as much attention and clout as possible. In an attempt to appeal to the right, he spoke a few blocks from Capitol Hill at conservative Hillsdale College, which stresses the teaching of \\"constitutional principles.\\" A coordinated media campaign that includes post-speech interviews is geared toward bolstering the significance of the speech. An alternative. Rubio's efforts to raise his profile and prove his substance is also an effort at differentiating himself from Democrats. His economic address comes the same week that President Barack Obama's summit on working families and the Clinton Global Initiative conference in Colorado that focused on jobs and the economy. It was attended by former secretary of state and potential Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton on wealth missteps: 'My record speaks for itself' Rubio's address contrasted the ideas they presented and, instead, took up themes Democrats have largely rejected, including a private option for Medicare and gradually raising the retirement age for Social Security. They are popular ideas within the Republican Party that would arguably save federal dollars. On jobs and economic mobility, Rubio detailed his ideas that include tax reform and tax credits for mothers obtaining an education and income-based student loan payments. He also backed a reduction of regulations and taxes and the repeal of Obamacare that he says prohibits employers from hiring, a far different platform from his Democratic counterparts. Kevin Madden, a former adviser to 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said Rubio is trying to fill a void. \\"He recognizes the Republican Party is very hungry for leaders who want to serve as a counterpoint to President Obama on the big policy issues,\\" he said. To beef up his foreign policy resume, the member of the Foreign Relations Committee has put himself out front on related matters. He appeared on the Sunday talk shows to discuss the U.S. response to the chaos in Iraq where he backed air strikes, a position Obama hasn't pursued. A crowded field. But to get where he'll contrast his ideas against a Democratic presidential candidate, he needs to differentiate himself from his fellow Republicans. Rubio is doing what other potential presidential candidates have done. Sen. Rand Paul has delivered numerous policy speeches throughout the country; Gov. Chris Christie has been active outside New Jersey in his role as head of the Republican Governors Association; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has begun strategically appearing at national conferences. They, and a dozen other potential candidates, have also traveled to early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Rand Paul: Will his star continue to rise? There lies the problem: Rubio is just one of many climbers trying to reach the same summit. As many as four governors, three senators, a former senator and two former governors are contemplating a 2016 run. Rubio faces a difficult slog to rise above the noise that the Republican race is already making. In a June CNN poll, Rubio pulled 8% among potential GOP presidential candidates. His support is low, but he fell smack in the middle of the large pack and not much worse than the most popular potential candidate, Paul, who garnered 14%. In a fractured Republican Party that consists of social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, tea party activists and pragmatists, Rubio will have to find his niche. Rubio's rising star. After he won his Senate race, Rubio was the face of the tea party. He was considered one of the more conservative to enter the Senate. But as the Republican establishment struggled to embrace the tea party, he became the glue. Party leaders saw potential and a future in Rubio. He's young, He's Hispanic and he's telegenic. \\"It's a great day for the conservative cause. New people with new thinking, new ideas -- 21st century solutions,\\" Jeb Bush said immediately after his victory. But politics is a volatile profession. Rubio's folly. Rubio's stock within the Republican Party plummeted last year when he held up the mantle for the Republican Party on immigration reform. He was part of a group of eight senators that forged an agreement, leading to the passage of comprehensive immigration reform. While he was dubbed \\"The Republican Savior\\" by Time Magazine for his work on a solution that has been unable to pass Congress for nearly a decade, conservatives called the bill amnesty for undocumented immigrants and conservative Erick Erickson called Rubio a \\"disappointment\\" on his blog Red State. \\"While some of us will be able to forgive Marco Rubio's rather rapid shift toward the very position he once vocally opposed, others probably will not be so forgiving,\\" Erickson wrote. Bob Vander Plaats, CEO of The Family Leader, a social conservative organization in Iowa that has a large amount of political influence in the critical presidential caucus state, said people \\"really backed away\\" from Rubio after immigration. Rubio, he said, is going to have to explain himself to Iowa Republicans. Iowa voters are \\"a very discerning lot,\\" Vander Plaats said. \\"They're willing to forgive. They're willing to try to understand.\\" Although his immigration position was likely to appeal to independent voters and even Democrats, the outrage proved the position was unpopular among the base, which he needs in a presidential primary. After the immigration fallout, Rubio felt the heat and backed away from the national spotlight. He laid low and made little noise. Rubio's return. Rubio has mostly avoided the topic of immigration except to pivot away from the bill he helped pass through the Senate by endorsing a fragmented approach in the Republican-led House. He maintained his latest stance again Wednesday when he said a solution for the millions of undocumented immigrants can't happen before the border is secure and a worker verification system is in place. Since 2014 rolled around, Rubio has been carefully crafting his image as a well-rounded, versatile leader in the Republican Party. He has repeatedly appeared on the business channel CNBC to discuss economic policies without mentioning immigration. A smart move, Madden said, because \\"it's dangerous when you make your name on one issue.\\" Madden, who has been watching his campaign, said Rubio is making the right moves, not only in the policy arena but the political one, too. \\"He's not making 2014 about Marco Rubio but making it about candidates across the country,\\" Madden said. Rubio was the first of the possible presidential candidates to endorse Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst. He traveled to the state to fundraise and campaign for her. His endorsement and her subsequent win helps him build relationships and a national infrastructure in critical states. Media. Check. Policy. Check. Politics. Check. Now Rubio has the long, treacherous trek of finding the voters who support him. \\"Slow and steady wins the race,\\" Madden said. How many ways can Romney say no to 2016?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the premise \\"Shoppers walk through an outdoor market.\\" true if \\"A group of shoppers walking at a market while purchasing items.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the premise \\"Shoppers walk through an outdoor market\\" can be interpreted as true if the statement given is \\"A group of shoppers walking at a market while purchasing items\\". Although the second statement provides more specific context, it doesn't negate the premise stated in the first sentence. To break it down further, the two sentences share several key components, which confirm the truth of the initial premise: 1. Shoppers/Group of Shoppers: Both statements involve the presence of shoppers, hence, there is no contradiction here. The second statement's use of 'group of shoppers' still falls under the purview of 'shoppers' in the initial premise. 2. Walk/Walking: The first premise states that the shoppers are walking, while the second statement also confirms this by mentioning that the shoppers are walking at a market. 3. Market: In both instances, the location is a market, wherever and whatever that may be, and does not contradict the initial premise. For the part of \\"outdoor\\" in the first statement, it may not be explicitly mentioned in the second statement whether the market is indoor or outdoor. However, unless it's noted that the market is indoors, the possibility remains that the market could be outdoors as well. It's also worth mentioning that the additional information of the shoppers purchasing items does not contradict the initial premise. The basic action – shoppers walking in a market – is present in both scenarios. The shoppers' activity of purchasing is simply an added detail and doesn't change the primary action of them being present and walking in the market. So, given all the comparable factors and unless further specifics indicate otherwise, one could conclude that the premise 'Shoppers walk through an outdoor market' holds true in the context of 'A group of shoppers walking at a market while purchasing items.'"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: \\"The spy became too friendly with his new contacts.\\" Pick from options: would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? Select from the following. -unacceptable -acceptable...I think the answer is","completion":"-acceptable From a linguistic perspective, the sentence, \\"The spy became too friendly with his new contacts,\\" is completely acceptable. It follows all the principles of syntax, morphology, semantics, and pragmatics, which are key areas in linguistics. Let's break them down to understand this more clearly: 1. Syntax: In terms of sentence structure, it follows the English language clause structure of subject-verb-object \\"The spy (subject) became (verb) too friendly with his new contacts (object).\\" 2. Morphology: The sentence employs appropriate morphemes, which are the smallest meaningful units in a language. All words are in their correct forms, within the plural and singular, tense, and comparison. 3. Semantics: The sentence is meaningful and understandable. \\"The spy\\" is a fully comprehensible subject. \\"Became too friendly\\" is a verb phrase that communicates a clear action and condition. \\"With his new contacts\\" serves as an adverbial phrase modifying the verb phrase, giving us additional information about with whom the subject became friendly. 4. Pragmatics: Looking at the context, supposing we understand who the \\"spy\\" and \\"new contacts\\" are, this sentence communicates a complete, clear idea about their relationship. The sentence also maintains the correct usage of articles, and there are no punctuation errors or misplaced modifiers which could potentially alter its intended meaning. So, in conclusion, a linguist would indeed rate this sentence as linguistically acceptable because it correctly follows all linguistic rules for English grammar and construction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this fact: \\"riding a bike does not cause pollution\\" Now answer this question: \\"which form of transportation has zero emissions?\\"","completion":"Bicycle riding is indeed a form of transportation that does not cause pollution, as it generates zero emissions during use. Cycling is a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transport that relies solely on human physical effort to propel the bicycle. Thus, it helps in reducing the carbon footprint, protecting the environment, and improving air quality. However, besides cycling, there are other forms of transportation that have minimal or zero emissions. Some of them include: 1. Walking: Like cycling, walking is another form of active transportation that does not produce any emissions. It is the most basic and energy-efficient mode of transport, beneficial for both the environment and personal health. 2. Electric Vehicles (EVs): Electric cars, motorcycles, and bicycles are powered by electricity, typically from a rechargeable battery. When charged using energy from renewable sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power, EVs are considered zero-emission vehicles. This contributes to cleaner air and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 3. Public Transportation (Electric Buses and Trains): Electric buses and trains produce no tailpipe emissions when running on electricity sourced from renewable or low-carbon resources. They contribute to reduced congestion and fewer vehicles on the road, further decreasing air pollution. 4. Solar-Powered Vehicles: Some vehicles, mostly experimental or prototypes, rely solely on solar power to operate. Solar panels installed on the surface of the vehicles harness the sun's energy and convert it into electricity, which powers the vehicle's motors. These vehicles have zero emissions. 5. Human-Powered Vehicles (HPVs): HPVs comprise a variety of transportation options, such as skateboards, scooters, rickshaws, and pedal boats, all relying on human muscle power and generating zero emissions. 6. Sailboats: Sailboats use wind power to navigate through water and have no engines or fuel requirements. When relying entirely on the wind for propulsion, sailboats are considered a form of zero-emission transportation. Although multiple forms of transportation have zero or very low emissions, it is important to consider other factors such as manufacturing, maintenance, and disposal processes that might have environmental impacts. However, using these low-emission transportation options contributes significantly toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving resources, and preserving the environment for future generations."},{"prompt":"Question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Our goal is to find what number b is. The problem looks like this: -37 * b + 159 * b + 618 = -968 Now, let's combine the parts with b's together. So, we will add -37 * b and 159 * b. Imagine that you have -37 apples and someone gives you 159 apples. You'll count them, and you'll have 122 apples. So, our problem will now look like this: 122 * b + 618 = -968 Next, we want to remove the 618 from this equation to make it simpler. To do this, we need to subtract 618 from both sides of the equation. Subtracting 618 from the left side will leave us with just the 122 * b: 122 * b = -968 - 618 Now we find what (-968 - 618) is equal to. If you have a room that is -968 degrees cold, and then it gets even colder, by 618 degrees, the room's temperature will be -1,586 degrees: 122 * b = -1,586 Now we just need to find out what number b is.

In Sentence 1, \\"The alchemists tried to turn lead into gold,\\" the word \\"turn\\" means \\"to change\\" or \\"transform.\\" The alchemists were attempting to change lead (a common metal) into gold (a precious metal) through a chemical process called alchemy.

Question: suppose less cracks get very big happens, how will it affect MORE/STRONGER earthquakes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. If fewer cracks get very big, it means that there will be less extensive fractures beneath the Earth's surface. This would likely result in a reduction in the overall pressure and movement around the cracks. Consequently, the amount of energy released when the rocks crumble would be lower, leading to a decrease in the intensity of seismic waves. With weaker seismic waves, the potential for more powerful or stronger earthquakes would also decrease. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of fewer large cracks would have a lessening effect on the occurrence of stronger earthquakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I can use this background: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels.

Background: The Roots is an American hip hop band, formed in 1987 by Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The Roots are known for a jazzy and eclectic approach to hip-hop featuring live musical instruments. Malik B., Leonard \\"Hub\\" Hubbard, and Josh Abrams were added to the band (formerly named \\"The Square Roots\\"). Since its first independent album-length release the band has released 10 studio albums, two EPs, two collaboration albums (with other artists), and also collaborated on recordings and in live shows with a wide variety of artists in many musical genres. Context: The Roots' original lineup included Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter (MC) and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson (drums), classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on local streets, they added bassist Josh \\"The Rubberband\\" Abrams, who went on to form the jazz group The Josh Abrams Quartet. They later added another MC, Malik Abdul Basit-Smart (\\"Malik B.\\") and Leonard Nelson \\"Hub\\" Hubbard (bass), and Scott Storch (keyboards). Kenyatta \\"Kid Crumbs\\" Warren (MC) was in the band for Organix, the Roots' first album release. Another MC, Dice Raw, joined the band in cameo appearances on later albums. The band filled Storch's position with Kamal Gray (keyboards), who continues in that capacity. Kamal Gray did not play with the Roots on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon between April or May and early September 2012. His absence was not publicly explained, however on the September 17, 2012 (NBC's 'Late Night' 700th) episode, Gray returned to the group. Beatboxer Rahzel was a band member from 1995 to 1999. Alongside Rahzel was turntablist/vocalist Scratch, who also DJ'd in live concerts. However Scratch left abruptly in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 1999 due to personal reasons but continued to record, making occasional cameos on some albums. Guitarist Ben Kenney, had a brief stint with the group and contributed to the Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus as bassist. Percussionist Frank Knuckles joined the lineup in 2002 and guitarist Kirk \\"Captain Kirk\\" Douglas replaced Kenney. Vocalist Martin Luther toured with the Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to the Tipping Point album. The group announced in August 2007 that its longtime bassist Leonard Hubbard was leaving. Owen Biddle was the band's bassist in 2007-2011. The band announced on August 25, 2011 that Owen Biddle left the band, replaced by Mark Kelley. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, James Poyser plays additional keyboards. Because most of the band members hail from Philadelphia and its surrounding area, they showed their support for the Phillies during the 2009 World Series against the Yankees, displaying Phillies memorabilia when performing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On the episode which aired the day after the Yankees clinched the title, Questlove stated \\"No comment!\\" on the show's intro (when he usually states the episode number), and had a Yankees logo purposely displayed upside-down on his drumset. In 2010, the group showed support for the Flyers during their run to the Stanley Cup Final by having the team logo on their drumset, and again in 2014 when the Flyers faced the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In April 2017, Frank Knuckles left the Roots due to family issues, and has not appeared on The Tonight Show since then. Later in August 2017, Knuckles sued Questlove, Black Thought and the band manager Shawn Gee over unpaid royalties.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who greatly valued the familial connections of Sissinghurst? ? Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

Question: \\"In what situations would someone with the condition in which a person's airways become inexplicably inflamed and produce mucus experience the condition more acutely?\\" Context: \\"Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up. During recovery from an attack, it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils. Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air. Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Someone with asthma may experience the condition more acutely in situations where they are exposed to certain triggers that cause their airways to become more inflamed and produce mucus. Some of the common situations or triggers include: 1. Exposure to allergens: Asthma symptoms may worsen when an individual comes into contact with allergens like pollen, dust mites, mold spores, and pet dander. In this situation, the immune system overreacts to these allergens, causing the airways to become inflamed and produce mucus. 2. Respiratory infections: Viral or bacterial respiratory infections, such as the common cold or bronchitis, can cause a person's asthma symptoms to become more severe. In this situation, the immune system's response to the infection leads to increased inflammation and mucus production in the airways. 3. Exercise: Exercise-induced asthma occurs when asthma symptoms become more pronounced during or after physical activity. In this situation, the airways may become more sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity, leading to increased inflammation and mucus production. 4. Exposure to cold air: Breathing in cold air can cause asthma symptoms to worsen. Cold air can cause the airways to constrict, making it difficult for the person to breathe and leading to increased inflammation and mucus production. 5. Emotional stress: Stress and strong emotions can trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals. During times of emotional stress, the body may respond by releasing chemicals that cause the airways to constrict and produce more mucus. 6. Chemical irritants and air pollution: Exposure to irritants like tobacco smoke, air pollution, or chemical fumes can cause asthma symptoms to become more acute. In this situation, the airways may become inflamed and produce mucus in response to the irritants. 7. Certain medications: Some medications, including beta-blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals. In these situations, the medications may cause the airways to constrict or become inflamed, leading to increased symptoms. By recognizing and avoiding these triggers, those with asthma can minimize the frequency and intensity of their symptoms. However, it is essential for individuals with asthma to work with their healthcare provider to develop a comprehensive management plan, including medications and lifestyle adjustments, to better control their condition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She sometimes played outside without her warm coat and didn't remember to always wash her hands before eating. So one day, Betty caught an upper respiratory infection, which meant she felt very sick. Because they were such great friends, Felicia and her family felt terrible for Betty. They decided to make a care package with comforting items like hot soup, warm blankets, fun coloring books, and soft tissues. Felicia even made a beautiful get-well-soon card to cheer Betty up. As Betty rested and took care of herself, she eventually felt better. Even though she was sick that year, the kindness of her best friend, Felicia, made her feel loved and cared for. After that, Betty always remembered to follow the important rules of staying healthy and made it her mission to help other kids in the town learn these rules too. And from that day on, Felicia and Betty went on many more adventures, and they both agreed that staying healthy is a very important part of having fun together. And they lived happily ever after. The end."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has accredited the facility which will test athletes for banned substances. The laboratory, based in Essex, has been tested over two years to make sure it is up to international standards. \\"Ensuring athletes come to London with confidence in the anti-doping programme is very important,\\" said Olympic gold medallist Jonathan Edwards. The move comes as the British Olympic Association (BOA) awaits a decision over the right to continue imposing lifetime Olympic bans on British athletes who have served suspensions for taking performance-enhancing drugs. The BBC's home of 2012: Latest Olympic news, sport, culture, torch relay, video and audio The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) is expected to rule this week. The BOA challenged a ruling from WADA that its by-law was unenforceable. The by-law was introduced more than 20 years ago and has kept a number of British athletes out of past Olympics. If it is revoked it could mean that banned athletes - sprinter Dwain Chambers and cyclist David Millar - would be eligible for London 2012 selection. The facility in Harlow, operated by King's College London , is estimated to be the size of seven tennis courts and will carry out more tests than at any previous Olympics. It will operate 24 hours a day during the games, ensuring that every medallist and more than half of all competitors will be tested. Pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has donated and equipped the lab, which it says is the major part of its Â£20m contribution to the games. \\"The WADA accreditation is a green light signal that the lab is ready,\\" said Jonathan Harris, head of anti-doping at Games organisers Locog. The laboratory underwent a series of rigorous tests including several site visits from WADA's science department and accrediting body ISO/IEC. Assessments focussed on the facility, equipment, procedures and staffing during three formal inspections and dummy sample testing. Over 1,000 Locog staff and a team of 150 anti-doping scientists will test up to 6250 samples during the Games. WADA president John Fahey said that accreditation meant the laboratory would operate to the highest standards during the Games. \\"Doping athletes must know that there is a very good chance they will be tested this summer,\\" he said. \\"Everything scientifically possible - and with the assistance of growing intelligence - will be done to make sure that their efforts to cheat are detected by the experts.\\" The facility will be led independently by Professor David Cowan from King's College London. \\"We have demonstrated that everything is in place and we are well prepared to deliver robust testing for the Games,\\" he said. \\"This accreditation provides recognition of our ability to operate an effective laboratory.\\" In 2011 GSK signed a long-term agreement with WADA to share information about medicines in development with a view to developing early detection methods. Summary:","completion":"The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) approved a big building in Essex where they will test athletes for bad substances. This place was checked for two years to make sure it's really good. An Olympic gold medal winner, Jonathan Edwards, said it is important that athletes trust this testing program. This building, in Harlow, will work 24 hours a day during the games and test more athletes than any other Olympics. A company, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), donated a lot to help this building do its job.

Answer:","completion":"How would you describe Jan's performance at the soccer tournament?"},{"prompt":"I have a new situation: Dan and Joey bot got into sugaring fruit and veggies, as they are vegan. Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right. But I can use this background: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. What is an answer for this question: Which fruit had a longer shelf life because of better preservation, apples or peaches? A:","completion":"Apples had a longer shelf life because of better preservation, as the peaches did not turn out right due to the humidity in the room."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Background: The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli .

Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet).

Answer the above question based on the context below: The group opened 1965 with their first tour of Australia and New Zealand, with Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales, on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate the police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.Following a mid-year tour of the United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music at the height of the British Invasion. Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, \\"Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments. Things like \\"Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks he can come over here and make a career for himself.\\" following which a punch was thrown and the AFM banned them.A stopover in Bombay, India, during the band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies to write the song \\"See My Friends\\", released as a single in July 1965.

FBI agents have arrested a music writer and public relations consultant after a nationwide manhunt following the discovery of explosives in his San Francisco apartment. Ryan Kelly Chamberlain III, 42, was taken into custody without incident Monday at Chrissy Field, a park just south of the Golden Gate Bridge. Cell phone video obtained by WGO-TV shows several heavily armed officers handcuffing Chamberlain near his white 2008 Nissan Altima and then leading him away. The arrest capped off a three-day search for him and fears that he was armed and dangerous and had rigged his car with explosives. Scroll down for video. Ryan Kelly Chamberlain is arrested after a three-day manhunt and fears that he was 'armed and dangerous' A witness filmed Chamberlain being carted off by federal agents Monday afternoon in view of the Golden Gate Bridge (right) In the end, the FBI says, he did not prove to be an immediate threat to the public, as authorities feared. The arrest comes on the same day Chamberlain appeared to post a lengthy screed online detailing his history of heartbreak, professional failure and struggle with depression. Questions have emerged whether it was meant to be a suicide note. 'You're reading this. That means we probably don't know each other anymore, and I oweeveryone an explanation,' he writes to an unidentified subject. 'I've timed this note on a Hootsuite delay, and now it's live, which means I wasn't around to stopit from posting.' He makes no mention of violence, but only says: 'I got dark. I got real dark. I explored myriad ways I could put an end to what I was going through. I binged-watched dark TV, sometimes didn't get off the couch for days.' Chamberlain also took to Twitter to deny the allegations against him: 'A panicked update to my letter that should have posted by now. Nothing they're reporting is true. No \\"stashes.\\" Not \\"armed and...' The tweet trails off. Chamberlain is a self-proclaimed 'political junkie' who had worked as a music writer before switching to public relations - although one friend said he had 'got weird' after losing a job last year. 'Armed and dangerous': Ryan Kelly Chamberlain, II, is being sought by the FBI after explosive materials were found in his San Francisco apartment during a raid. They warned that he could be dangerous until announcing Monday that he's no longer a public threat. The. nationwide alert was issued after the FBI showed up to Chamerlain's apartment,. located in the Russian Hill neighborhood, at 9am Saturday, with a search. warrant. Chamberlain did not answer the door. Authorities remained at the scene, and a hazmat team arrived to enter. the one-bedroom apartment. They remained on the scene well into the. evening, returning again on Sunday. According to ABC7,. who was on scene throughout the day, the hazmat team extracted a. toolbox from the apartment. Equipment such as x-rays and a bomb disposal. robot were used. Later in the evening, a loud bang was heard at the scene. Despite this, authorities did not evacuate residents from the surrounding apartments. 'There is no risk to public safety,' the FBI told ABC7. 'The protective equipment that you see is for agent safety.' Search: A hazmat crew searches Chamberlain's home on Saturday as part of a criminal investigation. The chemicals found in the apartment were not revealed as of Monday evening. Probe: Emergency services outside Chamberlain's apartment. Authorities were on the scene all weekend. Discovery: The back patio and sliding glass windows to Ryan Chamberlain's apartment at 1609 Jackson St in Russian Hill. The apartment remained sealed after FBI agents carried out a raid. Chamberlain may have bought the chemical off the Internet, the FBI told NBC Bay Area. Residents inside of the apartment complex also told the station that FBI agents took at least two computers from Chamberlain's apartment. More than a dozen bags of evidence were reportedly taken from the apartment. Chamberlain was described by a neighbor as 'a quiet guy, nice enough.' His boss at a music rights consultancy group said he last contacted her Friday to remind her to deposit his paycheck at a new bank account. Brooke. Wentz said the conversation was uneventful and that she was. 'tremendously dumbfounded' that the contractor she hired to handle her. company's social media accounts was a wanted man. 'He's a nice guy,' Wentz told The Associated Press. She. said it didn't seem like Chamberlain was staying in the apartment on. Jackson Street because when she mailed him his paycheck in April, he. told her he would have to go and collect it. She. said he seemed under financial pressure because he told her that two. friends who were leasing his apartment left without telling him and he. had to scramble to pay for two rentals. 'I. wondered what kind of friends would do something like that? I tried to. ask him about the situation but he was kind of evading my question,' Wentz said. Alex Clemens, founder of San Francisco's Barbary Coast Consulting, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Chamberlain had worked on numerous political campaigns. 'I'm. worried about the guy,' he said. 'I'm hoping this ends without anybody. getting hurt. I'm flabbergasted that this seems to be taking place.' No longer a threat: A picture of Ryan Chamberlain, a man in his 30s, found on his Twitter and Facebook pages. Chamberlain was the subject of an FBI manhunt after authorities found explosives in his home, but he's no longer considered a public threat.

The region includes most of the state of New York, excluding New York City and its environs, as well as Long Island, though the precise boundary is debated. Upstate New York includes the major cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and Syracuse. - Raquette Lake is the source of the Raquette River in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. It is near the community of Raquette Lake, New York. The lake has 99 miles (160 km) of shoreline with pines and mountains bordering the lake. It is located in the towns of Long Lake and Arietta, both in Hamilton County. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property. In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"in-holdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed. Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas. - The Adirondack Park is a part of New York's Forest Preserve in Upstate New York, United States. The park's boundary corresponds to the Adirondack Mountains. Unlike most preserves, about 52 per cent of the land is privately owned inholdings heavily regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency. This area contains 102 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and an active timber harvesting industry. The year-round population is 132,000, with 200,000 seasonal residents. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the great experiments in conservation in the industrialized world. - The lake's popularity derives from its remoteness, climate and beauty, as well as its notoriety as the location of the murder of Grace Brown in 1906. Alleged ghost sightings and subsequent media attention have added to the allure. - The Adirondack Mountains form a massif in the northeast of Upstate New York in the United States. Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of Adirondack Park. The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about in diameter and about high.

The terrain consists of low , rolling hills , with the exception of West Mountain near the eastern boundary . There are many brook trout ponds and streams and a considerable expanse of swampland along the courses of Sucker Brook and Beaver Brook . The forest cover runs to mature or near - mature mixed softwoods and hardwoods , with some dense spruce - balsam types near the summit of West Mountain and in the swamplands . Old - growth white pine can be found in the vicinity of Pigeon Lake and a few other places . It is easily accessible to the public from the south , southeast and southwest , but to a lesser extent from the west and north because of posted private lands . The chief attractions for the public are the trout ponds , which entice fishermen as well as campers who frequent scenic spots around Cascade Lake , Queer Lake , Constable Pond , Pigeon Lake and Gull Lake . It is also a popular area for hunters during the big game season . The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation maintains Brown Tract Pond Campground on the southeast perimeter . Motorboats are now banned from operating on Brown Tract Ponds to provide a more compatible situation for canoes and other non-motorized boats utilized by the campers . - Raquette Lake is a hamlet in the Town of Long Lake in Hamilton County, New York, United States. - Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - A wilderness area is a region where the land is in a natural state; where impacts from human activities are minimalthat is, as a wilderness.

Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - The Adirondack Park Agency (APA) was created in 1971 by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller as a governmental agency that performs long-range planning for the future of the Adirondack Park. It oversees development plans of private land-owners as well as activities within the Adirondack Forest Preserve. Development by private owners must be reviewed to determine if their plan is compatible with the park. The agency is headquartered in Ray Brook, New York. - Grace Mae Brown (March 20, 1886 July 11, 1906) was an American skirt factory worker whose murder caused a nationwide sensation, and whose life inspired the fictional character Roberta Alden in the Theodore Dreiser novel, \\"An American Tragedy\\", as well as the Jennifer Donnelly novel, \\"A Northern Light\\".

My oldest son, 9-year-old Salem, asked me several times where we would go to buy a backpack, while my other son, 6-year-old Abdullah, asked what school would be like this year. For the last three years, school was a nightmare for many children and their parents as violence increased and there were more attacks on schools and teachers.

Many kids who did attend school were accompanied by a parent for the entire day to make sure nothing happened to their children. For poor families or those with large families, back to school can be an expensive time. The government gives some help to those living in poor neighborhoods, and school bags, note books and other items are given for free. Most of the merchants who sell notebooks and pens now sell their products out on the street instead of in stores.

Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of international visitors come to Nepal each year to explore the spectacular Himalayan Mountains, providing poor communities with millions of dollars that they desperately need. The perils of that endeavor revealed themselves in stark fashion Tuesday, when at least 17 people from around the world died after being trapped in heavy snowfall while trekking at high altitude.

Nurse Ratched is a character in which 1975 film?","completion":"Nurse Ratched is a character in the 1975 film \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" This movie is based on the novel by Ken Kesey, who published it in 1962. The film was directed by Miloš Forman and stars Jack Nicholson as Randle P. McMurphy, a convict who fakes insanity to escape the hard labor of prison sentence and ends up in a mental institution. Nurse Mildred Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, is the main antagonist in the story. The movie delves into life within the mental institution, highlighting the oppressive control Nurse Ratched has over her patients. She represents the oppressive nature of authority and bureaucracy within the mental healthcare system. Her manipulative and tyrannical methods serve as a commentary on the mistreatment of patients within these institutions. Throughout the film, McMurphy clashes with Nurse Ratched as he encourages his fellow patients to question the authority and defy the dehumanizing rules enforced by her. While Nurse Ratched's methods are frequently criticized as cruel, she believes them to be necessary to maintain order and discipline among the patients. This power struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched creates tension and drama in the story, as both characters resist bending to the other's will. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" received widespread critical acclaim and numerous awards upon its release. It was the second movie in history to win all five major Academy Awards, which includes Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman). The film also won numerous Golden Globe and BAFTA awards. In addition to its commercial and critical success, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" left a lasting impact on the portrayal of mental health and authority in film. Nurse Ratched's character, in particular, remains a memorable representation of the abuse of power within institutional systems. Her character has been widely discussed in various contexts, such as literary studies, sociology, and mental health awareness campaigns. Overall, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is an influential film with a powerful and unforgettable villain in Nurse Ratched, whose character continues to serve as a talking point in discussions around mental health and societal control."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Early electromechanical digital computers primarily used electric switches and mechanical relays to perform calculations. These components operated at a significantly lower speed compared to their successors. One of the landmark examples of an electromechanical relay computer is the Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939. On the other hand, all-electric computers replaced the electromechanical components with faster and more efficient alternatives, specifically vacuum tubes. This upgrade led to a considerable increase in the operating speed of these computers and marked a significant advancement in digital computing technology.

Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\" and was probably the first \\"scientifically-equipped laboratory\\" in the United States.

The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter.

The eldest son (Hunter McCracken none SAG) of two characters (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) witnesses the loss of innocence.The movie, which exists as a metaphysical meditation and a lyrical poem, focuses at a microcosmic level on the story of Jack, a jaded, middle aged man (played by Sean Penn) scarred by the memories of an oppressive upbringing by his father (Brad Pitt), as well as the untimely death of his younger brother.We trace the evolution of an eleven-year-old boy in the Midwest, Jack, one of three brothers. At first all seems marvelous to the child. He sees as his mother does, with the eyes of his soul. She represents the way of love and mercy, where the father tries to teach his son the world's way, of putting oneself first. Each parent contends for his allegiance, and Jack must reconcile their claims. The picture darkens as he has his first glimpses of sickness, suffering and death. The world, once a thing of glory, becomes a labyrinth.Framing this story is that of adult Jack, a lost soul in a modern world, seeking to discover amid the changing scenes of time that which does not change: the eternal scheme of which we are a part. When he sees all that has gone into our world's preparation, each thing appears a miracle precious, incomparable. Jack, with his new understanding, is able to forgive his father and take his first steps on the path of life.The story ends in hope, acknowledging the beauty and joy in all things, in the everyday and above all in the family -- our first school -- the only place that most of us learn the truth about the world and ourselves, or discover life's single most important lesson, of unselfish love.

Article: Parents often think that time spent with their kids will gradually decrease in adolescence. But a new study suggests that while teens try to avoid spending a lot of time together with their parents, private parent-child meetings may actually increase in their early adolescent years. And that may raise a teenager's self-esteem and social confidence, especially if it is the time that spent with Dad, the researchers added. The researchers created a long-term study in which they invited families in 16 school districts in central Pennsylvania to participate. In each family, a teenager, a younger sibling , their mother and their father were interviewed at home and then asked about their activities and self-worth five times over a period of seven years. The study authors were surprised to discover that when fathers spent more time alone with their teenagers, the kids reported they felt better about themselves. Something about the father's role in the family seemed to improve self-esteem among the teenagers in the study, said study co-author Susan McHale, a professor of human development at Pennsylvania State University. \\"Time with Dad often involves joking, teasing, and other playful interactions. Fathers, compared to mothers, were more involved in leisure activities and had more peer-like interactions with their children, which is crucial for youth social development,\\" the study showed.

Be sure to tie the ends of the threads off into tight knots and to snip them off, as close to the fabric as you can. Try to use a stitch intended for sewing stretchy fabrics. It usually looks like a straight stitch, but is broken up by V-shapes.","completion":"This article focuses on providing guidance while sewing elastic bands into garments and highlights specific techniques required to achieve a good result. The main emphasis lies on creating a gap, which will allow the elastic to slide through with ease, and adopting suitable sewing techniques for stretchy fabrics. In order to create a gap for the elastic, the article suggests sewing the hems close to the raw or cut edge of the fabric, permitting enough space for the elastic band. Attention to this detail is crucial to ensure proper hemming and elastic insertion. As the hems are sewn, sewing pins are usually placed to secure the fabric's position. Once the seam is successfully stitched, the sewing pins can be removed. To avoid any loose threads that could potentially damage the garment or become entangled, the article recommends tying the ends of the threads into tight knots and trimming excess thread close to the fabric. This not only provides a clean finish but also ensures the longevity of the sewn garment. Furthermore, selecting the appropriate stitch when sewing stretchy fabrics plays a vital role in maintaining the fabric's elasticity and ensuring that the stitching can withstand stretching. The recommended stitch for these types of materials resembles a straight stitch interspersed with V-shaped stitches. This pattern provides a combination of durability and flexibility, as it allows the stitch to expand along with the fabric without breaking or causing tension in the material. In summary, the article provides valuable guidance on sewing elastic into garments, emphasizing the importance of creating a gap for the elastic, using appropriate stitching techniques, and finishing the task properly. These tips, if followed correctly, can enhance the effectiveness and durability of elastic bands in garments and ensure a comfortable, well-fitted final product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The addictive pull of Internet shopping is dragging thousands of victims into a rise of debt, including thousands of women who have run up huge credit card bills they cannot repay. The appeal of 24-hour access and the explosion in goods and services on offer has seen a 10 percent increase in credit card debts in the UK this year. Much of it has accounted for online spending. The latest report on Internet usage shows the number of adults logging on at home has risen from 10 million in October last year to 15.5m this month. The report by Continental Research, which has monitored Internet access in the UK for the past six years, found that while online shopping used to be experimental it is now becoming habitual, especially for women. Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, \\"Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this.\\" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper. The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000. He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. \\"You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,\\" he said. \\"It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.\\" Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit. It also provides secrecy---a central part of any addiction.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday tried to douse a political firestorm over the deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya, saying she's responsible for the security of American diplomatic outposts. \\"I take responsibility,\\" Clinton told CNN in an interview while on a visit to Peru. \\"I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts.

The attack took place in the eastern Libyan city that was the cradle of that country's 2011 revolution. Obama administration officials initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack. With criticism growing, Vice President Joe Biden said during last week's vice presidential debate that the White House did not know of requests to enhance security at Benghazi, contradicting testimony by State Department employees that requests had been made and rejected. After the debate, the White House said the vice president did not know of the requests because they were handled, as is the practice, by the State Department. Fact Check: Benghazi security. \\"In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion,\\" Clinton said. \\"And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens.\\" She added, \\"What I want to avoid is some kind of political gotcha or blame game.\\" \\"I know that we're very close to an election,\\" Clinton said. \\"I want to just take a step back here and say from my own experience, we are at our best as Americans when we pull together. I've done that with Democratic presidents and Republican presidents.\\" Her remarks drew a quick response from three Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee, including ranking member John McCain. Clinton's statement of responsibility was \\"a laudable gesture, especially when the White House is trying to avoid any responsibility whatsoever,\\" the Arizona senator said in a joint broadside with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. However, they added, \\"The security of Americans serving our nation everywhere in the world is ultimately the job of the commander-in-chief. The buck stops there.\\" Stevens, State Department computer expert Sean Smith and security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died in the Benghazi assault, which State Department officials now say was the work of dozens of armed men. Clinton also described a desperate scene in the State Department during the hours of the attack, as staff tried to find out what had happened. \\"This was a many-hour ordeal that we were all involved in, and I was deeply concerned as you would obviously assume, to hear about an attack,\\" she said.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who turned to musical journalism after a failed student career in Oxford and London? ? Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

But have you ever thought about taking pictures of them? Ken Libbrecht did. He is a physics professor from California. Although the weather in California is usually warm and sunny, Ken's hobby is taking pictures of snowflakes. He travels to cold areas like Alaska and Canada to find snowstorms and take pictures of the snowflakes. \\"They are often beautiful, and every snowfall brings new surprises,\\" says Ken. Ken takes pictures of snowflakes with a high-quality digital camera. He uses a microscope to make the tiny snowflakes larger. To get the best images, Ken built a special photo-microscope just for snowflakes. He collects flakes by letting them fall onto a piece of foam board . The pictures must be taken outdoors, so Ken wears lots of clothes to stay warm. But his fingers often get cold, because it's difficult for him to take pictures of a tiny snowflake with gloves. Each snowflake has shapes and patterns that make it as unique as a person's fingerprint. The hobby of snowflake photography is also unique. Next time a snowstorm blows through your town, take a closer look at the flakes before you gather them into a snowball. See if you can notice their unique patterns. Millions of snowflakes are waiting for you! ,. Question: Why do Ken's fingers often get cold? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because he doesn't wear gloves.\\"?

So, the answer \\"Because he doesn't wear gloves\\" can be considered partially accurate, as it is not explicitly stated if he doesn't wear gloves or if he wears gloves that are not suitable for the task. However, the main reason his fingers get cold is due to the challenges he faces in handling the delicate task of photographing snowflakes, which requires precision and often exposes his fingers to the cold weather."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them.

Please answer the following question: What was the first name of the person made the Grand Tour in his youth? Answer the above question based on the context below: Holkham was built by 1st Earl of Leicester, Thomas Coke, who was born in 1697. A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting. He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style. The \\"Palladian revival\\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio.

B). cursor to open up so she was able to access the information.","completion":"Brittany clicked on the file with her cursor, causing the file to open up so she was able to access the information. The choice \\"A\\" is the most appropriate continuation of the sentence because it emphasizes the logical sequence of actions in the context of computer usage. When Brittany uses her cursor to click on the file, the direct result should be the file -not the cursor- opening. The cursor is simply a digital tool Brittany uses to interact with the graphical user interface of her operating system. Its purpose is navigation and selection. On the other hand, the file is an object that Brittany interacts with using her cursor. Once a file is clicked or double-clicked (depending on the system settings), the file opens, revealing its content, whether that be text, image, video, audio, or program data. Therefore, once Brittany clicked on the file with her cursor, the file would open up, revealing whatever information it contained. Brittany might be searching for a piece of important data, about to edit a document, about to execute a software program, or she could be opening a media file for some much-deserved relaxation time. It's also possible that she's organizing files, in which case she would be routinely opening and closing files to check their contents. Choice \\"B\\" - The cursor opening up so she was able to access the information - is not a typical or logical sequence that happens in computing. Cursors do not open or close; they just move, click, and sometimes change form depending on their current function or the application in use. But they don’t contain a file type data to provide access to the information. This is why the next sentence to \\"Brittany clicked on the file with her cursor, causing the ...\\" should optimally be choice \\"A\\": \\"file to open up so she was able to access the information.” It’s the more logical and technically sound progression to the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences describe the impact of the Haymarket affair and how it led to a significant increase in the level of social consciousness or awareness among many individuals, as communicated by Goldman in her letters to historian Max Nettlau. In Sentence 1, the term \\"social consciousness\\" is used to describe the increased awareness of social issues, injustices, and inequalities that people began to recognize after the Haymarket affair. Social consciousness refers to the collective understanding and sensitivity individuals have towards societal problems and the need for change or reform in response to those issues. In Sentence 2, the term \\"social awareness\\" is employed, which generally implies the same concept as social consciousness: an increased understanding of social problems and the mutual desire for change. However, social awareness may be considered a broader term, encompassing not only the ability to identify societal issues but also the interpersonal skills that help individuals to act in an empathetic and ethical manner when interacting with others. Despite the slight variation in terminology, both sentences communicate the idea that the Haymarket affair was instrumental in enlightening numerous people about social matters, ultimately initiating the need for change and improvement in society.

Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966. - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With fellow member Paul McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership. - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene. - Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". - The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the Western world between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the American Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and became revolutionary with the expansion of the US government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born, catalyzed, or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s. - This article is a list of cover versions recorded and released by the Beatles as a band or solo artists . - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - George Harrison, (25 February 1943 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Sir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.

The answer is:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided, which is a climate warming up, may have indirect effects on blood glucose levels, but it is not directly related to the process you described. The process mentioned is a physiological response that occurs within the body to maintain blood sugar levels, and is mainly influenced by factors such as diet, physical activity, and hormonal regulation. However, a warmer climate could potentially have indirect effects on blood sugar levels. For example, it could lead to changes in food production and availability, impacting a person's dietary choices and potentially influencing their blood sugar levels. Additionally, warmer temperatures might encourage people to be more physically active, which can help in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. In some cases, extreme heat could also lead to dehydration and stress, potentially impacting blood sugar regulation.

Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said. By contrast, European firms will spend 150 million this year on electronic security, and are expected to spend 1 billion by 1992. Already many foreign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers, conference speakers reported. Still, encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy. One expert, whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldn't be named or quoted, said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers, for example, doubling as foreign spies. Moreover, he said, technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they've been \\"erased\\" from a computer's memory. He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read. No personal computer, not even the one on a chief executive's desk, is safe, this speaker noted. W. Mark Goode, president of Micronyx Inc., a Richardson, Texas, firm that makes computer-security products, provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness, known commonly as glasnost. Under Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Goode said, the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications. He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East. Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company, which hadn't been invited to submit a bid. The Soviets' eavesdropping paid off, however, because they got the contract.

You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Problem:Passage: In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named \\"dephlogisticated air\\". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: \\"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\\" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \\"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery. Question: What chemical did Priestley use in his experiments on oxygen?

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water - After a rain, water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock - The water percolates beneath the land surface - Some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water - Rainwater absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation - The water combines chemically with the carbon dioxide - A weak carbonic acid solution is formed The answer is:","completion":"The final step of the process is the dissolution of limestone and formation of solution caves. Once the rainwater has absorbed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and soil, forming a weak carbonic acid solution, it continues to permeate through the subsurface rock layers, especially in limestone and similar soluble rocks such as dolomite and marble. As the weak carbonic acid solution comes into contact with the limestone rock, it reacts chemically, dissolving the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) that the rock primarily consists of. This process is known as carbonation. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows: CaCO3 (limestone) + H2CO3 (carbonic acid) → Ca(HCO3)2 (calcium bicarbonate) The calcium bicarbonate formed in this reaction is soluble in water, unlike calcium carbonate. Over time, as more and more of the limestone rock dissolves, the cavities and fissures within the rock expand, creating larger voids and interconnected passageways. This continuous dissolution and erosion of the limestone leads to the formation of solution caves, which may later merge with other caves to form extensive cave systems. Apart from creating solution caves, this process also leads to the formation of various secondary cave features, such as stalactites, stalagmites, columns, and flowstone, as the calcium carbonate precipitates from the dripping or flowing water and re-crystallizes. The caves and their unique formations subsequently attract tourists, scientists, and cavers, offering numerous opportunities for exploration, research, and appreciation of Earth's natural beauty. In summary, the final step of the given process is the dissolution of limestone by the weak carbonic acid solution, ultimately resulting in the formation of solution caves and speleothems (cave features) within the soluble rock."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Obama's Supreme Court pick meets with first GOP senator Sen. Mark Kirk on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to meet with Merrick Garland, President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. The senator from Illinois, who is facing a competitive re-election this fall, slammed his GOP colleagues, some of whom have flatly refused to meet with Garland or even consider holding confirmation hearings. “I think we should do our jobs,” Kirk told reporters after the meeting, adding that he hoped other Republicans will follow his lead. “We need a rational, adult, open-minded consideration of the process.” Kirk is perhaps the most endangered Senate Republican facing re-election in November. And when it comes to the battle over Obama's pick to fill the court vacancy, Kirk has been an outlier. He's one of just three Senate Republicans to say the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold hearings on Garland. And he's one of two GOP senators -- along with Susan Collins, R-Maine -- to say the full chamber should vote on the nominee. \\"I think when you just say I'm not going to meet with him and all, that's too closed-minded,\\" Kirk said Tuesday. Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., insist that Obama's successor should fill the Supreme Court vacancy after American voters have a say in November. The death last month of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia created the court opening, and Obama is pressing to make his third appointment to the high court. \\"By leading by example, I'm showing what a rational, responsible guy would do that really wants the constitutional process to go forward,\\" Kirk said. The senator called Garland \\"one of the most eminent jurists in the country.\\" Democrats have been insisting that the Senate go through the regular confirmation process for Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. With most public opinion polls showing majorities favoring action on Garland, the Democrats' goal is to force GOP senators to buckle under pressure or make some of them facing re-election pay the price on Election Day. At least 13 Senate Republicans have said they'd be willing to meet with the federal judge, though many said they would tell him that he won't get a vote. Earlier this month, Kirk said on a Chicago radio program that the Senate should \\"man up and cast a vote.\\" Garland has met with seven Democratic senators. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"On Tuesday, Senator Mark Kirk became the first Republican senator to meet with President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.

In a post noted by Foreign Policy and the New York Times, Hafez purportedly writes, \\"America doesn't have soldiers, what it has is some cowards with new technology who claim themselves liberators.\\" He adds: \\"I just want them to attack sooo much, because I want them to make this huge mistake of beginning something that they don't know the end of it.\\" \\"They don't know our land like we do, no one does, victory is ours in the end no matter how much time it takes,\\" the post says. The page perhaps gains credibility via the people who \\"like\\" it, including, apparently, other Assad family members and the kids and grandkids of top officials. On the other hand, \\"Hafez\\" claims to play for Barcelona's soccer team, have attended Oxford University, and have been in a relationship (though the 11-year-old is now single, it seems). Regardless of the page's authenticity, \\"at the very least, it was written by someone doing a convincing impersonation of what the family believes,\\" writes David Kenner for Foreign Policy. Expand this summary.","completion":"Bashar al-Assad's son, Hafez, who is only 11 years old, has allegedly made some audacious political statements on a Facebook page presumed to be his. The posts were noticed by Foreign Policy and the New York Times, making international headlines. In one of the posts, Hafez allegedly writes that America lacks real soldiers and only has \\"cowards with new technology who claim themselves liberators.\\" He further provokes the US, expressing his desire for an attack, as he believes it would lead to America making a grave mistake by starting a conflict they cannot comprehend the consequences of. Moreover, the post highlights Hafez's confidence in Syria's ability to triumph over any invading forces, stating, \\"They don't know our land like we do, no one does, victory is ours in the end no matter how much time it takes.\\" The supposed Facebook page's credibility stems from the numerous people who \\"like\\" it, which allegedly includes other members of the Assad family and the children and grandchildren of high-ranking officials in the country. Nevertheless, the authenticity of the Facebook page remains uncertain. Within the page, \\"Hafez\\" claims to play for Barcelona's soccer team, to have attended Oxford University, and to have previously been in a relationship, which seems unlikely for an 11-year-old. Regardless of whether the page is authentic or not, David Kenner of Foreign Policy argues that the sentiments expressed on it are a plausible representation of the beliefs of the Assad family. The existence of this Facebook page, whether official or not, signals the intensity of emotions surrounding the ongoing Syrian conflict and the complex web of interests at play in the region. With tensions running high, it serves as a reminder that the stakes are elevated, and as a result, any seemingly trivial statement or action from key figures could potentially escalate the situation. While some might dismiss an 11-year-old's views or the legitimacy of such social media posts, the fact that the story has garnered attention from influential publications demonstrates that the potential impact of online activity should not be underestimated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paragraph: In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence. Question: \\"The four became somewhat of a sect meeting 3 to 4 times a week and what was it that Atta would write on the rent checks?\\" Answer: \\"House of the followers\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"House of the followers\\" is correct.

orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god 's law from only the male 's view . that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . the story takes place in jerusalem 's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . it is a slow - moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they ca n't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . he even thanks god that he did n't make him a woman . his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . meir is a talmudic scholar . his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . since the hasidim look upon a woman 's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man 's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . she receives an anonymous letter that states \\" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \\" meir 's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . meir 's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \\" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \\" all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . their religion does n't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she can not tell him that because of their religion . so when meir 's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . rivka 's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . he now works as a singer in a nightclub . malka 's mother is worried that her daughter wo n't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she does n't love . yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound - truck with a bull - horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . the harshest scene in the film is on malka 's wedding night . yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . but the choices are obliterated by one 's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . for the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . gitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close - knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed .","completion":"N"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is not possible to tell The statement \\"Those who feel a holiday isn't the same without a game are welcome to tee off there\\" implies that there is a suitable place or venue to engage in playing games during a holiday. If we try to analyze whether we can conclude \\"Those who feel holidays aren't the same without a game are gonna have to deal with the pain,\\" we must evaluate both scenarios — when people have access to games during holidays and when they don't. In the first scenario, where people have access to playing games during holidays, we cannot make the conclusion that they will have to deal with the pain. The provided statement offers an opportunity for those individuals to participate in games (e.g., golf, as suggested by \\"tee off there\\") during their holidays, which can contribute to a more enjoyable and satisfactory experience. In this case, the pain of not having access to games while on holiday could be avoided. However, the second scenario is when people don't have access to playing games during their holidays. In this situation, the conclusion might be more accurate. If a person feels that holidays aren't the same without a game, they may experience disappointment, dissatisfaction, or even emotional pain due to the lack of games or engaging activities. They will, in essence, have to \\"deal with the pain.\\" Given that the statement only provides information about the first scenario and does not clarify whether all people feeling this way will have access to games during their holidays, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether or not they will have to experience the pain.

On his first day on the job, he is shown hostility from Old Bill (Steve Bisley), the head of the police force, for being unable to find his gun and getting shot on duty when he couldn't bring himself to fire his weapon on an armed boy. Shortly afterwards, the police learn that Jimmy Conway (Tom E. Lewis), a convicted murderer who was arrested by Old Bill for killing his wife, has escaped from prison. Knowing that Jimmy will return to town to seek revenge, Old Bill orders his officers and a group of civilians to arm themselves and shoot Jimmy on sight. Old Bill's men prove to be no match for Jimmy, who remorselessly kills officers and armed civilians. The convict encounters Shane but lets him live. When Shane finds Old Bill, he confronts Bill over the fact that Jimmy spared his life and learns that Bill has refused to call for backup from a nearby town. Shane draws his gun on Bill, but again finds himself unable to fire it and is subsequently knocked out and handcuffed to a table. Shane escapes and uses a satellite phone at Gleason's farm to contact the nearby police for backup. During the call Shane discovers Gleason (Cliff Ellen) on the verge of hanging himself; when Shane talks to him, the farmer reveals that Jimmy Conway is innocent of the murder of his wife. The murder was the work of Old Bill and his men, who set fire to Jimmy's house after raping and killing his wife, revenge for Jimmy's interference in a proposed railroad extension that would have gone through Red Hill.

The authorities had been closely monitoring the situation, anticipating any possible unrest among the labor force and took swift action to prevent the escalation of the situation. The protest was aimed to take place at one of the city's major industrial zones, with thousands of workers coming together to voice their concerns and dissatisfaction with the current working conditions and policies. Aside from the usual complaints involving low wages and long hours, the workers expressed concerns about safety measures in their workplace and the impact of these conditions on their overall well-being. Upon becoming aware of the plans for the protest, the Beijing police took proactive steps in order to avoid any unwanted incidents. Firstly, law enforcement officers were dispatched to the planned protest site, prepared to handle any disturbances and maintain public order. Additionally, the Beijing police engaged in open dialogue with the workers in an effort to understand their grievances and find a peaceful resolution. By engaging in constructive communication, the police managed to reach a compromise with worker representatives which included the promise of further discussions and potential improvements to the working conditions in the region. This helped to effectively pacify the frustrated workers, ultimately leading to the prevention of the protest. With this successful intervention, the Beijing police have once again demonstrated their commitment to maintaining stability and order within the city. However, the underlying issues that led to the planned protest cannot be ignored.

James Spears, the Great Titan of the chapter, said the group would be rallying to protest “the Confederate flag being took down for all the wrong reasons.” Story Continued Below “It’s part of white people’s culture,” he added. Brian Gaines, who runs the South Carolina Budget and Control Board, which oversees reservations, confirmed the scheduling in an email to POLITICO Monday. He added that the group submitted the request on June 23 and, because his office allows any group, regardless of ideology, to reserve the grounds on a first-come, first-serve basis, the KKK will be able to hold its rally. The event is planned for July 18 from 3-5 p.m., just over one month after Dylann Roof allegedly entered a historic church in Charleston and shot to death nine African-Americans during a Bible study meeting. Reports indicate Roof was attempting to incite a race war and had read 34 various materials from white supremacist groups online before plotting his crime. Roof’s use of the Confederate battle flag in photos posted online before the massacre set off a national debate over the flag and other Confederate iconography on public grounds throughout the South — leading South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, along with a bipartisan cast of state and federal lawmakers, to call last week for the flag’s removal. The South Carolina Legislature is expected to decide on the Confederate symbol’s fate early next month. The KKK’s Pelham chapter liberally employs the Confederate flag on its website and has changed its home page to highlight its opposition to the flag’s removal. “Say No to Cultural Genocide,” the group’s site reads, adding, “most groups out there and especially white people are to [sic] cowardly to stand up for their heritage.” When asked for his opinion on the charges facing Roof, Spears said, “I feel sorry for the boy because of his age and I think he picked the wrong target. A better target for him would have been these gang-bangers, running around rapping, raping and stealing.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A man named Dennis Prokopec was arrested because the police think he may have started a fire at his ex-fiancee's house.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"While the suggested answer provides valuable information about KFC's global presence, it does not specifically answer your original question: \\"Where is the greatest concentration of KFC in the world?\\" The mention of KFC being the world's second-largest restaurant chain (in terms of sales) after McDonald's and its having over 18,000 outlets in 120 countries and territories is accurate and informs us about its extensive worldwide presence, but these details do not reveal where the highest concentration of KFC restaurants is. The highest concentration or greatest number of KFC stores can be defined in different ways, such as the most KFC units in a country or the most KFC units per capita. For instance, if we consider the total number of units or restaurants, the United States, the birthplace of KFC, tops the list. However, China may be the leader when it comes to the number of units and sales volume outside the U.S. If we want to look at the number of KFC units per capita, then small countries with a significant number of KFC outlets, such as Trinidad and Tobago, could be potential candidates. In conclusion, for the verification of the given answer, it falls short of fully addressing the question of the highest concentration of KFC outlets. It may require further research or a more precise answering scheme to correctly respond to the question as it has been asked. Therefore, you should not validate this answer as it doesn't directly answer your question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It was established in 1998 as the Mitteilungen aus dem Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe and originally published on behalf of the Museum für Naturkunde by Wiley-VCH; since 2014 it has been published by Copernicus Publications. The editors-in-chief are Martin Aberhan, Dieter Korn, and Florian Witzmann (Museum für Naturkunde). - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\". - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - Scaphirhynchus is a genus of sturgeons native to the United States of America. All species in this genus are considered to be threatened. The pallid sturgeon is Endangered and the Alabama sturgeon is Critically Endangered. - Acipenseriformes is an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes the sturgeons and paddlefishes, as well as some extinct families. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - The lead ship, name ship, or class leader is the first of a series or class of ships all constructed according to the same general design. The term is applicable to military ships and larger civilian craft. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case. - Pseudoscaphirhynchus is a genus of fishes in the Acipenseridae family. The three species, all of which are threatened, are restricted to Central Asia. - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee. - USS Sturgeon ( SSN - 637 ) , the lead ship of her class of nuclear - powered attack submarines , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sturgeon . - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - A ship is a large buoyant watercraft. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity. Ships are used on lakes, seas, rivers, and oceans for a variety of activities, such as the transport of people or goods, fishing, entertainment, public safety, and warfare. Historically, a \\"ship\\" was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere.

Pneumonia, in some cases, can quickly spread from one sheep to another and result in deaths. Take the afflicted sheep and put them in a quarantine separate from the rest of the herd making sure they do not share grazing land, food, or water supplies.","completion":"Monitoring the sheep's condition closely Keep a close eye on the sheep's behavior, respiratory rate, temperature, and overall activity level. Normal temperature for sheep ranges from 102°F to 104°F (38.8°C to 40°C); a higher temperature usually indicates an infection. Other symptoms to monitor can include coughing, rapid or labored breathing, nasal discharge, and a decrease in appetite. Additionally, observe for potential secondary infections that may arise due to a suppressed immune system. Administer antibiotics and supportive care as recommended Consult a veterinarian to complete an examination, diagnose pneumonia, and recommend treatment options, which may include administering antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications. Follow the vet's prescription strictly and administer the drugs at the correct dosage and frequency to maximize their effectiveness. For supportive care, you can provide extra care like ensuring the quarantined sheep has a clean, dry, comfortable, and well-ventilated space for rest, which can help prevent further respiratory distress. Ensure proper nutrition and hydration Pneumonic sheep may lose their appetite and may not eat as much as they should be. Monitor their food intake and provide them with fresh, high-quality hay, and easily digestible food that does not require them to consume bulky amounts. Proper hydration is crucial, so maintain a reliable water source that is clean and easily accessible for the sick sheep. Supplement additional vitamins and minerals With consultation from your veterinarian, consider giving the sick sheep vitamin and mineral supplements to boost their immune system and improve the chances of a successful recovery. Vitamin E and selenium are crucial for sheep's immune health and can be supplemented when approved by a vet. Check and maintain proper barn ventilation Environment plays a significant role in the development of pneumonia, as sheep can become susceptible to pathogens from poor air quality, excessive dust or ammonia levels, and high humidity. Ensure your barn or shelter is well-ventilated and clean, creating optimal living conditions for your sheep. Regularly remove any buildup of feces and damp bedding. Keep a close watch on the rest of the flock Despite removing the sick sheep from the herd, it is still essential to monitor the rest of the flock for similar signs and symptoms. Take preventive measures, maintain proper hygiene, sterilize feeding supplies, and promptly remove a sick sheep if any more pneumonia cases arise. Follow-up with the veterinarian After providing proper care and medication for a prescribed period, you must follow up with your veterinarian for further evaluation. The vet may perform a physical examination and, if necessary, additional diagnostic tests to confirm the sheep's recovery and ensure it is safe to reintegrate the healed sheep back into the flock. Implement preventive measures To reduce the chances of a future occurrence of pneumonia amongst your flock, maintain proper vaccinations and deworming, provide good living conditions, avoid excessive exposure to dust, and ensure proper ventilation. Regular health checks and keeping an eye on any changes in behavior can further aid in early detection and prompt treatment to avoid severe consequences for your flock."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over 1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.

Question: What rules are at play? Movie title: The Contractor Movie plot: Retired CIA black-ops hitman James Jackson Dial (Wesley Snipes) is living his life in seclusion on his ranch in Montana when he is offered the chance to redeem himself by his former employer, Jeremy Collins (Ralph Brown). Some years earlier, Dial had been seconds away from taking down notorious terrorist cell leader Ali Mahmoud Jahar (Nikolay Sotirov) but his carelessness allowed Jahar to escape, marking his assignment as a failure. Now Collins wants Dial to complete his task by assassinating Jahar, who has been captured and is now in the custody of the police in London, England. Provided with a safe house, passports, and an assistant, Terry Winchell (Richard Harrington), Dial is off to London to complete unfinished business. Disguised as a priest, Dial gets into position in a church bell tower across the street from the building that Jahar is being brought into. When Jahar is brought out of the police van, his head is covered by a jacket, leaving Dial without a clean shot. Not wanting to fail again, Dial patiently waits for his opportunity. Moments later, from his high vantage point, Dial spots Jahar standing inside the building with his back to the window. Dial grasps the opportunity and shoots through the glass, fatally hitting Jahar in back of his head. Because of the delay caused by a pair of cops, Winchell is late in bringing the getaway car, and this brings attention to them fleeing the scene. After numerous attempts to stop the car, the police open fire, killing Winchell. The car, now out of control, comes to crashing stop, injuring Dial. But Dial manages to get out of the crashed car. On the run and bleeding profusely, he makes his way to the safe house, where he meets curious 12-year-old neighbor Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who lives with her grandmother (Gemma Jones). Emily helps Dial stop the bleeding. Even though Jahar has been eliminated, the assignment is still considered to be failure by Collins because Dial had been filmed fleeing the scene by a security camera. Meanwhile, Collins is being...

U.S. Olympic swimmers Gunnar Bentz (R) and Jack Conger are mobbed by the media and onlookers while leaving the police station after questioning in Rio de Janiero. (Photo: Chris McGrath/Getty) RIO DE JANEIRO — A day after leaving Brazil, American swimmer Gunnar Bentz offered an apology for his role in a late-night incident that drew international attention after teammate Ryan Lochte claimed they had been robbed at gunpoint and local police called that a fabrication. But Bentz also said surveillance videos from the gas station where the incident occurred appear to be missing camera angles and scenes that support the four U.S. swimmers' accounts. And he supported Lochte's account that money was demanded from the swimmers at gunpoint before they were allowed to leave. In a statement released by the University of Georgia, where Bentz is a junior, he provided details of the account he gave Rio police after he and teammate Jack Conger were pulled off a plane on Wednesday and prevented from leaving the country. Bentz' version largely supports what Lochte has asserted about the swimmers being in a cab that was approached by armed men who flashed a badge and pointed guns at them, but his statement also rejected Lochte's initial version. And Bentz was critical of Lochte, who Bentz said got into a “heated verbal exchange” with security guards. “Without question, I am taking away a valuable life lesson from this situation,” Bentz wrote in a statement where he apologized to the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Swimming, Team USA athletes and the university. “In everything I do, I am representing my family, my country and my school,” he said. “I will not take that responsibility lightly.” In his statement, Bentz admits the swimmers, who had been drinking at a party and were on their way back to the Olympic Village, stopped at a gas station to use the restroom but instead relieved themselves behind the building. Bentz said Lochte was the one who “pulled to the ground a framed metal advertisement that was loosely anchored to the brick wall.” Vandalism denied Bentz said he did not see anyone trash the restroom at the station, or even enter it. Fernando Veloso, Rio's chief of police, had said the swimmers vandalized the station's restroom – allegedly breaking open the door, causing damage to a mirror and ripping a soap dispenser off the wall. \\"There was a locked door out back and I did not witness anyone breaking it open,\\" Bentz said. Bentz said there was no damage to the restroom to the best of his knowledge. Video shot by USA TODAY Sports of the bathroom on Thursday found the bathroom intact — the soap dispenser hung on the wall and the mirror was not damaged.

USA TODAY After the four men had returned to the vehicle, according to Bentz’s account, two men approached the vehicle and told them to get out. As Conger and Jimmy Feigen walked away, a security guard held up his badge and drew his handgun, Bentz said. Bentz said he called his teammates back, and a second guard pointed his gun at the swimmers. \\"Again, I cannot speak to his actions, but Ryan stood up and began to yell at the guards,” Bentz said. “After Jack and I both tugged at him in an attempt to get him to sit back down, Ryan and the security guards had a heated verbal exchange, but no physical contact was made.” Bentz’s statement aligned with that of a witness, Fernando Deluz, a disc jockey who told the Globo television network that he became an impromptu translator. Deluz said the only discussions between the swimmers and the guards were about minor damage — the sign that was knocked off a wall. Bentz said through an interpreter, one of the guards holding a gun on them demanded that the swimmers pay for knocking the sign down to be allowed to leave. He said he gave them 20 and Feigen gave them 100 Reals, which is about 33. “They lowered the guns and I used hand gestures to ask if it was okay to leave and they said yes,” he said. Incomplete videos Bentz stressed that he was never a suspect in the matter and that he has not made any false statements to Rio authorities. Bentz’s account refutes Lochte’s original story that the taxi the swimmers were riding in was pulled over. But it closely matches the version Lochte gave on Wednesday to NBC's Matt Lauer, as it appears on the video that the guards did stop the cabbie from pulling away. Lochte said when the cabbie refused to go and the armed men approached the car, he thought they were being robbed, Lauer said . Bentz’s statement also refutes one by Veloso that two women were with the swimmers. Bentz said the swimmers and driver were the only ones in the cab. Bentz also questioned whether the videos released so far show a complete account of what happened. “Videos of this situation have been emerging the last several days” he said. “However, I am confident that some video angles have not been shown that would further substantiate my account. I also believe some scenes have been skipped over.” PHOTOS: Every U.S. medal won at Rio Olympics ||||| (CNN) The following is a statement from U.S. Olympic swimmer Gunnar Bentz released by the University of Georgia on Friday. (Bentz's statement was released hours after fellow Olympian Ryan Lochte apologized for his behavior over the weekend at a Rio de Janeiro gas station.) \\"I want to offer a sincere apology to the United States Olympic Committee, USA Swimming, the extraordinary women and men of Team USA, and the University of Georgia. Being a member of the Olympic Swimming Team was an honor and a dream come true. The accomplishments of my teammates were awe-inspiring and I'm so pleased I got to see them up close. I regret this situation has drawn attention away from the Olympics, which have been hosted so incredibly well by Brazil and its citizens. \\"While I am anxious to put this matter behind me and rejoin my Georgia teammates in classes, practices and competitions, I feel compelled to stress several key points. 1. I was never a suspect in the case from the beginning (Brazilian law enforcement officials saw me only as a witness). 2. I never made a false statement to anyone at any time. \\"I also want to be forthright about the details of what transpired last Sunday. What follows is consistent with the account I gave to the Brazilian authorities when I was interviewed for the first and only time on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro: \\"After attending an event with several swimmers from different nations, I left in a taxicab along with U.S. swimmers Jack Conger, Jimmy Feigen and Ryan Lochte around 6 a.m. On the way back to the Olympic Village, we pulled into a convenience store to use the restroom. There was no restroom inside, so we foolishly relieved ourselves on the backside of the building behind some bushes. There was a locked door out back and I did not witness anyone breaking it open. I am unsure why, but while we were in that area, Ryan pulled to the ground a framed metal advertisement that was loosely anchored to the brick wall. I then suggested to everyone that we needed to leave the area and we returned to the taxi. \\"Two men, whom I believe to have been security guards, then instructed us to exit the vehicle. No guns were drawn during this exchange, but we did see a gun tucked into one of the guard's waistband. As Jimmy and Jack were walking away from the vehicle, the first security guard held up a badge to me and drew his handgun. I yelled to them to come back toward us and they complied. Then the second guard drew his weapon and both guards pointed their guns at us and yelled at us to sit on a nearby sidewalk. \\"Again, I cannot speak to his actions, but Ryan stood up and began to yell at the guards. After Jack and I both tugged at him in an attempt to get him to sit back down, Ryan and the security guards had a heated verbal exchange, but no physical contact was made. \\"A man that I believe to be a customer approached us and offered to help as he spoke both English and Portuguese. Understandably, we were frightened and confused during this time. Through the interpreter, one of the guards said that we needed to pay them in order to leave. I gave them what I had in my wallet, which was a 20 bill, and Jimmy gave them 100 Reals, which is about 50 in total. They lowered the guns and I used hand gestures to ask if it was okay to leave and they said yes. We walked about a block down the street and hailed another taxi to return to the Village. \\"Videos of this situation have been emerging the last several days. However, I am confident that some video angles have not been shown that would further substantiate my account. I also believe some scenes have been skipped over. Additionally, I would like to stress that our original taxi was not pulled over; the only occupants of the taxi were the four of us and the driver; and to my knowledge, there was no damage done to the door or the inside of the restroom. \\"I am so thankful for the love and support of my family, my friends and my teammates during this time. Without question, I am taking away a valuable life lesson from this situation. In everything I do, I am representing my family, my country and my school.

Given the question: Question: what causes photo red eye I found the following answer on Google: The effect appears in the eyes of humans and animals that have tapetum lucidum . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct, but it is not complete. Photo red-eye is a phenomenon that occurs in photography when light from the camera flash reflects off the retinas of human or animal subjects, causing their eyes to appear red or glowing in the captured image. The tapetum lucidum is a layer of reflective tissue found in the eyes of many nocturnal animals, which contributes to improved night vision by allowing the light to be reabsorbed by the photoreceptor cells. When a camera flash illuminates the eyes, the light reflects off the tapetum lucidum as well as the blood vessels in the retinas, creating the red-eye effect. However, the red-eye effect is not solely due to the presence of the tapetum lucidum, as humans do not have this reflective layer and still experience red-eye in photos. The primary cause of red-eye in humans is the reflection of light from the camera flash off the blood-rich retina at the back of the eye. Several factors can contribute to the red-eye effect: 1. Pupil size: In low-light conditions, the pupils dilate to allow more light to enter the eye. When the camera flash is bright and sudden, the pupils do not have enough time to constrict, causing more light to be reflected off the retina and resulting in the red-eye effect. 2. Angle of the flash: If the camera flash is positioned close to the lens and aimed directly at the subject's eyes, the chances of red-eye occurring are higher. To minimize red-eye, ensure the flash is at an angle to the subject or use an external flash that can be positioned away from the camera lens. 3. Camera settings and features: Many cameras offer red-eye reduction features that emit a brief pre-flash or series of flashes before capturing the photo. This causes the subject's pupils to constrict, thereby reducing the amount of light that can be reflected off the retina. 4. Distance to the subject: Red-eye is more likely to occur when the subject is close to the camera, as the amount of reflected light that reaches the camera sensor is higher. To minimize the red-eye effect, photographers can utilize red-eye reduction features, adjust camera angles, use off-camera or bounce flash, or increase the ambient light in the scene. Additionally, photo editing software can often be used to correct red-eye after the image has been captured."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Process: - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose blood sugar increases happens, how will it affect more glucose is made. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"When blood sugar increases, the pancreas and liver go through a different process than the one described in the original process, but the perturbation does have a direct effect on the overall regulation of blood glucose levels in the body. Here's an overview of the process when blood sugar increases: 1. Blood sugar levels rise, such as after consuming a meal with carbohydrates. 2. The increased blood sugar is detected by cells in the pancreas called beta cells. 3. In response, these beta cells release a hormone called insulin. 4. Insulin helps cells in the body to take up the glucose from the blood for use as energy or for storage as glycogen or fat. 5. As cells take in glucose, blood sugar levels reduce back to normal. Now, addressing the perturbation hypothesis: If blood sugar increases, more glucose is not directly synthesized from glucagon, as that would counteract the body's efforts to bring blood sugar levels back down. However, this situation does indirectly affect the overall glucose regulation process and emphasizes the importance of the balance between insulin and glucagon. Insulin and glucagon work in tandem to maintain blood glucose levels within a normal range. When blood sugar increases, insulin lowers it by promoting glucose uptake by cells. Conversely, when blood sugar drops, glucagon raises it by stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. In summary, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the blood glucose regulation process, but not on the original process involving glucagon. When blood sugar increases, the body utilizes insulin to lower blood sugar levels rather than creating more glucose from glucagon. The balance between insulin and glucagon helps maintain stable blood sugar levels in the body."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

And in each lunch I packed, I left a note. The note might be a thank-you for a special moment, or a few words of encouragement for the coming test or sporting event. When they were little, they loved their notes. And when I went back to teaching, they even put notes in my lunches. As they grew older, my elder son, Marc, told me that he no longer needed my daily notes. Telling him that he no longer needed to read them but I still needed to write them, I continued the tradition until the day he graduated. Six years after high school graduation, Marc called and asked if he could stay at home for a couple of months. He had spent those years well, and he was very successful. He lived far away from home. With his younger sister leaving for college, I was especially looking forward to seeing Marc at home. Since I was still making lunch every day for his younger brother, I packed one for Marc, too. Imagine my surprise when I got a call from my 24-year-old son, complaining about his lunch. \\"Did I do something wrong? Aren't I still your kid? Don't you love me any more, Mom?\\" he asked.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who beat McGwires' record?","completion":"Title: Shattering Records: The Man Who Beat Mark McGwire's Home Run Record Introduction In the world of Major League Baseball, breaking records has always been a testament to a player's incredible talent, perseverance, and prowess on the field. This is especially true for the home run records, which have witnessed some of the biggest moments in baseball history. One such memorable milestone is Mark McGwire's impressive single-season home run record, which was eventually surpassed by an equally talented and dedicated athlete - Barry Bonds. Mark McGwire's 1998 Major League Baseball Season Mark McGwire, playing as a first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1998 MLB season, went on an extraordinary home run rampage that year. He was locked into a fierce competition for the home run title with Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs. McGwire finished the season with a staggering 70 home runs, breaking the previous record of 61 held by Roger Maris since 1961. McGwire's record-breaking home run came on September 8, 1998, when he hit a low pitch off Chicago Cubs pitcher Steve Trachsel. With that single swing, he etched his name in the history books and became an instant legend. The competition with Sosa, dubbed the \\"Home Run Race of 1998,\\" is widely credited with reviving interest in Major League Baseball following the 1994 strike. Barry Bonds: The Man Who Broke the Record While Mark McGwire basked in the glory of his record-setting performance, a powerful force was emerging on the baseball horizon – a left fielder for the San Francisco Giants named Barry Bonds. Bonds had already built a reputation as one of the best hitters of his generation. He was a 3-time National League MVP, a multiple Gold Glove, and Silver Slugger Award winner, and a 12-time All-Star. Entering the 2001 Major League Baseball season, there was a palpable sense that Bonds might have what it takes to challenge and even surpass McGwire's home run record. As the season progressed, Bonds started building up momentum, hitting home runs with incredible regularity. The Turning Point: September 2001 In the final month of the season, Bonds was swinging for the fences like a man on a mission, amassing home runs at an unprecedented pace. On October 5, 2001, in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Bonds broke the single-season home run record with his 71st homer of the year. Bonds didn't stop there – by the season's end, he'd hit an astonishing 73 home runs, shattering McGwire's record by a wide margin. His performance earned him his fourth National League MVP award, solidifying his place in the pantheon of baseball greats."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be putting these limes directly into the water after you slice them up, so you want them to be perfectly clean. Cut the limes into thin slices.","completion":"After cutting the limes into thin slices, proceed with the following steps to make lime water: 1. Choose a suitable container: Find a large, clean glass jar or pitcher which can hold at least 1 liter (approximately 1 quart) of water. Since you'll be storing the lime water in this container and potentially serving it from here, choose something with a lid or cover. 2. Add lime slices to the container: Place the sliced limes into the bottom of the container, spreading them out evenly to ensure proper infusion of the lime flavor into the water. You may also choose to lightly squeeze the lime slices before adding them to release more of their juices, but this is optional. 3. Fill the container with water: Pour cold, filtered water into the container until it's full. It's important to use filtered water to avoid any impurities that may affect the taste and quality of your lime water. 4. Stir the mixture: Use a long spoon or stirrer to gently mix the lime slices with the water. This helps to distribute the lime flavor throughout the water more evenly and ensures better infusion. 5. Refrigerate the lime water: Allow the lime water to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2-4 hours. This gives the lime flavor enough time to infuse into the water. For a more intense lime flavor, you can let it sit overnight. 6. Serve the lime water: When you're ready to enjoy your lime water, pour it into a glass with ice, and if desired, add a splash of sparkling water for a refreshing twist. You may also garnish your glass with a fresh lime wedge or a sprig of mint. 7. Store leftover lime water: Keep any remaining lime water in the refrigerator, covered with a lid or plastic wrap. For the best flavor and freshness, consume the lime water within 1-2 days. In addition to being a refreshing and delicious drink, lime water also has numerous health benefits. It's a great source of vitamin C, which helps boost your immune system and supports healthy skin. Lime water also aids digestion, reduces inflammation, and may even help with weight loss.

Question 1: If an 'empty' space is a superfluid and you rolled a bowling ball through it, would it roll on forever as it moves through and displaces the superfluid? Question 2: In space, if I turn ON a Fan and then turn it OFF, will the blades keep rotating forever? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Okay, let's break these down one by one, painted with the colors of a 5-year-old's imagination. Question 1: Imagine you have a toy truck and a big tub of honey. If you try to move the truck through the honey, it would be hard, right? But if that honey was magic, and let things pass through without stopping them, your truck would slide all along without stopping. It's kind of the same with a 'superfluid' and the bowling ball: a superfluid is like magic honey, allowing things to slide forever without slowing down! Question 2: Picture again your toy fan. You set it spinning and then stop giving it power, does it spin forever? Well, on Earth it doesn't, because air (which is invisible) slows it down, and so does the friction in the fan's parts. But if you were playing in space, which doesn't have air like earth, and if there was no friction, your fan might just go on spinning, because there's nothing to slow it down! So, to answer your final question, the superfluid and space situation are similar but not exactly the same. What's common in both scenarios though, is the lack of things (like air or friction) that normally stop or slow down things from moving, so that's why the bowling ball could roll on forever in superfluid and the fan blades could keep spinning forever in space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: Make pop corn.","completion":"To make popcorn, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather necessary ingredients and utensils. - You will need popcorn kernels, cooking oil (vegetable, canola, or coconut oil), a large heavy-bottomed pot with a lid, salt or desired seasonings, and measuring spoons. Step 2: Measure and heat the oil. - Pour about 2-3 tablespoons of cooking oil into the pot. This amount should be enough to lightly cover the bottom of the pot. Heat the oil over medium heat. Be cautious not to set the heat too high to avoid burning the oil. Step 3: Test the oil temperature. - To ensure the oil is hot enough, drop one or two popcorn kernels into the pot and cover it with the lid. When you hear those kernels pop, the oil is ready for the rest of the popcorn kernels. Step 4: Add popcorn kernels. - Measure 1/3 to 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels, depending on how much popcorn you'd like to make. Remember that the popcorn will expand significantly as it pops, so adjust the amount accordingly. Carefully pour the kernels into the hot oil and use a spoon to distribute them evenly across the bottom of the pot. Step 5: Cover and shake the pot. - Once the kernels are in the pot, quickly place the lid on top. Using potholders or oven mitts to protect your hands, gently shake the pot back and forth while holding the lid to ensure the kernels are evenly coated with oil and heat. This will help the popcorn cook more evenly and prevent burning. Step 6: Listen for popping sounds. - As the popcorn kernels heat up, they will begin to pop. Continue shaking the pot back and forth occasionally as the popping continues. When the popping sound begins to slow down significantly or has a few seconds in between pops, it's time to remove the pot from heat. Step 7: Remove the pot from heat and wait. - Take the pot off the stove and let it sit for about 30 seconds, allowing any remaining kernels to pop. Keep the lid on to prevent any stray kernels from flying out. Step 8: Season and enjoy. - Carefully remove the lid from the pot, allowing any trapped steam to escape. Be cautious not to burn yourself with the steam. Season the popcorn with salt or any desired seasonings and gently shake or mix to evenly distribute the flavoring. Serve the popcorn in a large bowl and enjoy!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin.

Given the background: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. and the situation: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Answer the following question: Which car would emit less unburned hydrocarbons, car A or car B?","completion":"To determine which car emits less unburned hydrocarbons, we need to consider the presence of the catalytic converter in the cars. Step 1: Identify the key difference between the two cars - In this case, it is the presence of a catalytic converter in car A and the lack of one in car B. Step 2: Understand the function of a catalytic converter in relation to unburned hydrocarbons - A catalytic converter helps convert unburned hydrocarbons into less harmful substances, such as carbon dioxide and water. Step 3: Compare the two cars based on the information - Since car A has a catalytic converter and car B does not, it is logical to conclude that car A would more effectively convert unburned hydrocarbons, reducing their emissions. Based on these steps, Car A would emit less unburned hydrocarbons compared to car B due to the presence of a catalytic converter, which helps to convert such emissions into less harmful substances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Five of the country's leading internet service providers (ISPs) are taking part in the Copyright Alert System (CAS), which they say is designed to educate rather than punish users. Suspected persistent copyright infringers will receive six warnings, after which their internet access may be limited but not cut off. Campaigners are calling for an independent body to oversee the scheme. One group, called Demand Progress, has warned that ISPs \\"want to serve as judge, jury, and executioner\\". But organisers have indicated that once users received six alerts they would be considered outside the system. In other words, they are unwilling to change their behaviour, so nothing else would be done. The scheme was supposed to launch last year, but organisers announced a last-minute delay, which they blamed on Hurricane Sandy disrupting final tests. Verizon, Time Warner, Cablevision, Comcast and AT&T are all taking part in the initiative, which is co-ordinated by the Center For Copyright Information (CCI) - a group representing rights holders in the media industries. \\"Over the course of the next several days... our content partners will begin sending notices of alleged peer-to-peer copyright infringement to ISPs, and the ISPs will begin forwarding those notices in the form of copyright alerts to consumers,\\" announced the CCI's executive director Jill Lesser. \\"Consumers whose accounts have been used to share copyrighted content over P2P networks illegally (or without authority) will receive alerts that are meant to educate rather than punish, and direct them to legal alternatives. And for those consumers who believe they received alerts in error, an easy-to-use process will be in place for them to seek independent review of the alerts they received.\\" The ISPs are being left to determine their own responses to users who either ignore six warnings or fail to challenge the evidence against them and it is not yet clear exactly how each will act. Verizon initially said in a FAQ that it would slow users' access speed down to 256Kbps, \\"a little faster than typical dial-up speed\\" for up to three days - but later deleted the information from its site. The original version can still be read via a snapshot Google took of the page. A spokeswoman was unable to explain the change at this time. Time Warner said it planned to limit internet access to a pop-up showing a telephone number which the user must call. After a conversation with a customer service representative their service would be restored, it said. AT&T said it would require its uses to \\"review materials on an online portal that will educate them on the distribution of copyrighted content online\\" after four alerts before they could continue to use the internet. \\"Because customer privacy is paramount, we will not share or release our customers' names or other personally identifiable information to the content owners,\\" Brent Olson, AT&T's vice president of public policy added. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has raised several concerns about the scheme. It notes that the CCI states that \\"subscribers are responsible for making sure their internet account is not used for copyright infringement\\" and that the ISPs urge users to restrict access to their wi-fi connections. \\"This seems designed to undermine the open wi-fi movement,\\" said the EFF, referring to efforts to encourage users to share their wi-fi connections with others. It is suggested that free internet access can make locations more tourist-friendly and aid the emergency services. \\"Open wireless is widely recognised to be tremendously beneficial to the public.\\" It added that it believed an independent body should vet the process. Meanwhile the UK has favoured a proposed \\"three strikes\\" policy. Under telecom regulator Ofcom's draft code, users who receive three warnings within 12 months would have anonymous information about their activities passed to copyright holders which could then seek court orders to discover their identities. The policy had been due to come into effect in March 2014, but has been delayed after a House of Lords committee queried whether the Digital Economy Act - which the code is part of - complied with Treasury rules. The government subsequently withdrew the legislation. A spokesman for the Department for Culture Media and Sport said it would \\"reintroduce the statutory instrument as soon as possible\\".

Given the question: Article: Alan took an early interest in gardening---first on his grandfather's Yorkshire allotment in Ilkley, and then in his parents' back garden. Small polythene greenhouses appeared in the back garden, and cacti were bought from church markets. Alan left school at fifteen with one \`O' level in Art and took a job as an apprentice gardener in Ilkley Parks Department nursery, studying for his City and Guilds in Horticulture in the evening. He went on to horticultural college at Oaklands in Hertfordshire where he studied for one year full-time, being awarded the National Certificate in Horticultural. This was followed by three years at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, resulting in the award of the Kew Diploma. After two years as supervisor of staff training at Kew, Alan entered journalism where he became first a gardening books editor, and then Deputy Editor of Amateur Gardening magazine. He appeared regularly on BBC Radio and Television in programs such as Nationwide , Breakfast Time, Open Air, Pebble Mill, Songs of Praise, Titchmarsh's Travels, and the Chelsea Flower Show. He presented the 100th edition of The Word for Channel 4, and hosted the quiz show Ask the Family. Gardeners' World and the hugely popular Ground Force, second only to Easterners in the BBC1 ratings, are broadcast as far as Australia, New Zealand and North America. After leaving both programs, Alan worked on two other series for the BBC to be transmitted in 2003 and 2004, one of them a landmark series on the natural history of Britain. Alan writes for the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Radio Times and BBC Gardeners' World magazine, and has more than thirty gardening books to his credit. His four novels, as well as a book about his own life, have been best sellers. Alan, 53, gardens organically, and lives with his wife, two daughters and a medley of animals.

The green, red and white of the Mexican flag will be everywhere as tens of thousands of Mexican-Americans and other Chicagoans gather to celebrate the Fifth of May or Cinco de Mayo. That is the day the Mexican army defeated the French invasion against all the odds in the Battle of Puebla in 1862. In Pilsen, they will mark the occasion with a parade of elaborate floats, mariachis, local beauty queens and talented horsemen. And, being a celebration of Mexico, you'll be able to find good food, music and chelas (beer). Particularly the beers. \\"In Chicago, the Cinco de Mayo is a marketing ploy to sell alcohol,\\" says Vincent Rangel, the President of the Mexican Civic Association of Illinois, and long-time resident of the city. \\"I've been in Chicago for 63 years, and we're dumbfounded at how the date has taken on a life of its own. Especially when you consider that it's really not celebrated in Mexico, unless you're actually from Puebla.\\" That, says Mr Rangel, is the great irony of the raucous Cinco de Mayo party in the United States: it's a far bigger affair north of the border than it is in Mexico itself. These days, it has an important political dimension too. President Barack Obama celebrated the Cinco de Mayo with a group of prominent Hispanic leaders on the Rose Lawn. They were served tuna ceviche and lamb in tamarind mole as President Obama used the occasion to garner support for the Dream Act, a bill to grant legal status to undocumented young people. Meanwhile in Mexico City, the day is likely to pass off like any other Saturday. Few bars will be doing anything out of the ordinary, and there is no sense that this is the \\"Day of Mexican Pride\\" as it has been dubbed in the United States. Apart from in one particular neighbourhood towards Mexico City's international airport, Penon de los Banos. Here, the recreation of the Battle of Puebla has been held for decades and all day the small barrio will reverberate to the sounds of muskets, canons and blood-curdling battle cries. And, of course, there will be a huge event in Puebla itself. The picturesque city is where, 150 years ago to the day, the Mexican army under the command of General Ignacio Zaragoza, supported by indigenous warriors carrying machetes, drove out the French troops of Napoleon III. \\"Mexico was between two fires,\\" says Juan Pablo Salazar, the official historian of Puebla. \\"Either we embraced the United States or we embraced Europe.\\" At that fork in the road, he says, the Battle of Puebla was crucial in determining the future direction of Mexico by choosing to defend its fledgling sovereignty from the invading forces. The nature of the victory was crucial too. \\"The French assumed they'd flatten everyone, particularly the indigenous tribes who had no military technology,\\" the historian says. But the Indians, supporting a vastly outnumbered Mexican army, came out to fight from all over Puebla. \\"They were very poor, simple people and they fought with their souls. You can imagine the political importance the United States made of the victory. It was a way of telling France: 'This is ours, America is for the Americans'.\\" The tale of the outnumbered and weaker Mexicans claiming an unlikely victory against one of the most powerful militaries in the world adds to the romance of the Cinco de Mayo, says Juan Pablo Salazar. It is a story which has been celebrated by successive Mexican governments for a century and a half. On Saturday, thousands of modern-day soldiers will take time away from military matters in Mexico to recreate the battle in front of President Felipe Calderon. Back in the US, there are still a lot of misconceptions about the Cinco de Mayo, says Mexican-born Chicago resident, Vincent Rangel. \\"Most people think it's Mexican Independence Day,\\" he chuckles. (That's actually on 16 September.) \\"We home-grown Mexicans laugh a bit at the half-price margaritas and the buckets of Corona beer for five dollars. I know of Irish pubs that have Cinco de Mayo specials, it's bizarre.\\" But, he adds, for fear of sounding like a killjoy, the older generation aren't trying to rain on the parade. \\"I think it's encouraging when people ask us 'What is this Cinco de mayo thing all about?' \\" \\"I explain to my friends who are Germans or Poles or Jewish that, for me at least, it's a moment for quiet reflection about the great sacrifice people made 150 years ago to get us to this point.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The Cinco de Mayo celebration on the 5th of May, honoring the day the Mexican army defeated the French in the Battle of Puebla in 1862, has become a significant event for Mexican-Americans and other Chicagoans. Parades, festive floats, mariachis, and good food are part of the celebration, but criticisms abound, stating that the event has been commercialized for alcohol sales in Chicago. Curiously, Cinco de Mayo celebrations are more grandiose in the United States than in Mexico itself, with only Puebla and few parts of Mexico City commemorating the day. The battle was significant for determining Mexico's sovereignty and future direction, with the unlikely victory against the powerful French army being celebrated by successive Mexican governments. Despite misconceptions about the event, the Cinco de Mayo serves as a moment of reflection on the sacrifices made 150 years ago to achieve their sovereignty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A dutch oven or high-sided cast iron pan are your best bets, as they retain heat well and have big sides to prevent splattering oil. This is cold oil, not hot, as this process heats up the oil and fries simultaneously. This simulates the double-fry method mentioned above. As the oil heats up it leaches moisture from the potato, which allows the later heat (once the oil is up to temperature) to actually fry the chip. The oil will begin to bubble up around the fries, which is a good sign. These bubbles aren't actually oil, but escaping water molecules. You should be able to easily pierce the potatoes with a fork. This means they've softened enough to really start frying. The bubbling in the oil should crank up significantly, and after 20-25 minutes you should notice that the fries are starting to get golden brown and delicious looking. A few more minutes and they'll be perfect. Remove the fries from the hot oil with a slotted spoon or wire strainer, then pat dry with paper towels. Don't let excess oil stick around -- it leads to soggy fries. Once you're done patting, season liberally with salt and serve. Summary:","completion":"To make yummy fries, use a dutch oven or a big pan with high sides. Fill it with cold oil and put the potato slices inside.

Select the topic that this about: The International Olympic Committee joined the investigation yesterday into allegations that Marion Jones, the American gold-medal sprinter, had used anabolic steroids and other illegal bodybuilding drugs.","completion":"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recently announced its involvement in the investigation into allegations that Marion Jones, the American gold-medal sprinter, had used anabolic steroids and other illegal bodybuilding drugs. The issue of doping in sports, specifically the use of anabolic steroids and performance-enhancing drugs, has long been a matter of concern for the global athletic community. The involvement of the IOC in this case reflects the committee's commitment to ensuring fairness and transparency in sports, as well as upholding the values of the Olympic Games. Marion Jones is an accomplished American sprinter who has won several Olympic medals in her career, including gold medals in the 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x400 meter relay events during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. However, allegations of doping offences have cast a shadow over her achievements, leading to widespread skepticism and the need for a thorough investigation. Anabolic steroids are synthetic substances that are similar to testosterone, a naturally occurring hormone that is responsible for promoting the growth of skeletal muscles and the development of male sexual characteristics. Athletes and bodybuilders use anabolic steroids to enhance their physical strength, increase muscle mass, and improve their performance. However, the use of such substances is illegal in competitive sports and can lead to serious health risks and long-term damage. The allegations against Marion Jones came to light after the exposure of the BALCO doping scandal. The Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) was found to be providing anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to various athletes, leading to widespread repercussions in the sports world. Marion Jones was one of the many athletes under suspicion due to her association with BALCO founder, Victor Conte. The IOC's decision to join the investigation demonstrates its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the Olympic Games by eliminating doping and other unethical practices. The investigation will be extensive, as it will involve collaborating with various national and international agencies such as the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), and other sporting organizations. The IOC will also be reviewing past test results, interviewing witnesses, and scrutinizing available evidence to determine if Marion Jones did indeed use performance-enhancing drugs during her career. If found guilty, Marion Jones could face severe consequences, such as being stripped of her Olympic medals and being banned from future athletic competitions. Moreover, the incident would serve as a grim reminder of the importance of ensuring fair competition among athletes. It is important to note that while the investigation is ongoing, Marion Jones has the right to defend herself and present her side of the story. The involvement of the IOC signifies the seriousness of the matter, and the committee will likely spare no effort to uncover the truth. At the same time, the case highlights the importance of continued vigilance against doping in the world of sports and the need for stricter regulations to prevent athletes from seeking an unfair advantage through the use of illegal substances. In conclusion, the International Olympic Committee's involvement in the Marion Jones doping investigation showcases their determination to uphold the values of the Olympic Games and maintain a fair and transparent environment in sports. The case of Marion Jones underscores the ongoing battle against the use of anabolic steroids and other illegal bodybuilding drugs in athletics and emphasizes the importance of ethical conduct in sports to preserve the spirit of competition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men.

Dennis was better at expressing their feelings than Benjamin because","completion":"Dennis was better at expressing their feelings than Benjamin because he had spent considerable time intentionally developing his emotional intelligence and practicing various forms of communication. This difference between the two individuals can be attributed to multiple factors, which include not only their respective personality traits but also their upbringing, experiences, and the ways in which they have chosen to cultivate these skills. From a young age, Dennis showed a natural proclivity for understanding and empathizing with others' emotions. His parents encouraged this behavior by consistently validating his emotions, teaching him how to label them, and helping him develop the tools necessary to express them constructively. This positive reinforcement instilled in Dennis a strong sense of self-awareness and emotional literacy, which allowed him to navigate social situations effectively and build strong connections with the people around him. As Dennis continued to grow and develop, he consistently sought out opportunities to hone these skills further. He participated in group therapy, emotional intelligence workshops, and other forms of interpersonal development programs that focused on fostering empathy, active listening, and emotional self-awareness. This education provided Dennis with even more strategies and tools to express his feelings in a healthy manner. In addition to this formal education, Dennis made a conscious effort to practice expressing his feelings in his day-to-day life. He set goals for himself, such as maintaining a regular journal-writing practice to explore his emotions and clearly articulating his thoughts and emotions to his friends and family. By practicing these habits, Dennis refined his ability to gauge his own emotions with clarity and precision, as well as the emotions of others. In contrast, Benjamin never quite received the same level of emotional support growing up. His family environment discouraged open expression of emotions, leading him to suppress his feelings and struggle with understanding the emotions of others. Without the early foundation of emotional literacy that Dennis had, Benjamin found it difficult to navigate social situations and forge strong connections with others. Furthermore, Benjamin did not actively seek out opportunities to develop his emotional intelligence and communication skills. While he may have been aware of the potential benefits of doing so, the lack of initial support created a barrier that made it difficult for him to prioritize emotional growth in the same way Dennis did. As a result, Benjamin's ability to understand and express his feelings remained underdeveloped compared to Dennis. Due to these experiences and personal choices, Dennis became better at expressing his feelings than Benjamin over time. Dennis' commitment to emotional growth and willingness to engage in self-reflection have allowed him to become a more empathetic, understanding, and effective communicator when it comes to articulating his feelings. Meanwhile, Benjamin’s lack of emotional support, minimal practice, and differing priorities have left him struggling to connect with others and express his emotions openly. This divergence in emotional intelligence and communication skills is ultimately what sets Dennis apart from Benjamin in terms of expressing their feelings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: These are commonly sold at stores that sell moving supplies, including U-Haul locations. You’ll also be able to find mattress covers at a local hardware store. They commonly sell for about 5–10 USD. During the process of being moved, the sides and top of your mattress may come in contact with floors, stairs, the ground outside, and the inside of a moving van (or the top of your car). You can use a plastic mattress cover to prevent your mattress from collecting dirt and permanent stains. If you’re simply moving the mattress from one room to another within the same house or apartment, you don’t need to purchase or use a mattress cover. Before you begin to package and move the mattress, it needs to be lifted off of the bed frame or box spring it’s been resting on. Also remove any blankets or quilts. You can probably move the mattress with the fitted sheet and mattress pad still on, but remove all other sheets. Start by standing the mattress on its side and slipping the end farthest from the zipper over the base of your mattress. Work the cover up over the mattress by tugging on the top of the cover, and then on the bottom. Keep sliding the cover up until the entire mattress is inside. If you have someone with you, ask them to hold the head of the mattress a few inches up in the air. Once your mattress is completely in the moving cover, you can adjust the corners of the cover as needed. Make sure that there are no spots where the plastic is stretched thin around the mattress inside and might tear. Then, zip the bag closed. If your mattress cover doesn’t have a zipper, you’ll need to use packaging tape to make sure that the cover is completely sealed. Fold over the top flap of the plastic cover, and tape down all of the loose edges so no dust can make its way inside. Before you begin to move the mattress, make sure that you have a clear path to the vehicle or rental truck you’ll be placing the mattress in. Clear any boxes or furniture out of the path you’ll be walking through, and prop doors open so you won’t have to open them while holding the mattress. Even if you’re only moving the mattress from one room to another within a house or apartment, still clear a path. You could easily trip over a stray side table or chair. If there is more than one route outside, figure out which route to take before you begin walking. Communicate this to the person helping you move the mattress.","completion":"Mattress covers can be found at stores selling moving supplies or local hardware stores for around 5-10 USD. They protect mattresses from dirt and stains during the moving process. If you're only moving the mattress within the same house or apartment, a cover isn't necessary.

In the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete. The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval centre. In 1853, the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theater (1941).

This move comes as several significant gains within the industry have been observed in recent months. Analysts have speculated that this initiative could further solidify Lloyds' presence in the financial sector, creating a more comprehensive and competitive banking institution. Abbey National, known primarily as Abbey, is a reputable bank within the UK banking market. With a longstanding history dating back to 1849, Abbey has cultivated an unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction and growth. Its highly sought-after services include personal banking, mortgages, savings accounts, as well as insurance products. With its robust portfolio of offerings, acquiring Abbey would markedly expand Lloyds' current range of services. Lloyds Banking Group, one of the Big Four clearing banks of the United Kingdom, is no stranger to strategic acquisitions. As one of the oldest banks in the UK with over 250 years of operation, Lloyds continually proves its dedication toward achieving excellence in the financial sector. The acquisition of Abbey National will not only enhance Lloyds' product offerings but also allow the group to tap into Abbey's consumer base of over 18 million customers. Ongoing developments within the UK banking sphere have prompted Lloyds to reconsider their initial offer. As major competitors in the sector continue to expand and innovate, increasing their bid for Abbey National marks a strategic move to stay ahead. Sources within Lloyds have expressed increased optimism over the success of the proposed acquisition; however, the exact amount of the revised bid remains undisclosed. The potential acquisition of Abbey National would mark yet another milestone in Lloyds' ambitious journey to become the leading financial institution in the United Kingdom. With a focus on customer satisfaction and reliable services, the combined efforts of these two banking giants could deliver exceptional financial solutions to both current and future clients. Notwithstanding any challenges that may arise during the acquisition process, Lloyds Banking Group aims to ensure a smooth transition for the customers and employees of both organizations. With the close collaboration of Lloyds' top executives and Abbey's management team, this merger promises a seamless integration that would uphold the core values and long-standing traditions of both banks. In conclusion, Lloyds Banking Group's reported decision to increase their bid for Abbey National reflects their unyielding determination to strengthen their position in the UK banking sector. By acquiring the esteemed Abbey, Lloyds could provide enhanced services and customer experiences that uphold the storied legacies of both organizations. However, there are undoubtedly many critical factors and nuances to consider in this potential acquisition. As more details emerge from this strategic move, stakeholders and industry specialists alike will be watching closely to see how the financial landscape responds to the formidable union between Lloyds Banking Group and Abbey National."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: HARRISBURG - In her 93 years, Philadelphian Viviette Applewhite said, she had missed her chance to vote for president just once - and that was because she could not find her polling place despite spending 12 hours looking. This fall might mark the second time, Applewhite testified Wednesday in Commonwealth Court, because a new state law says she must bring photo identification to the polls in order to vote. And thanks to a purse-snatcher, she hasn't got much in the way of photo ID. Applewhite, who came to court in a motorized wheelchair and testified of having once marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said voting \\"gives me the right to help people and myself.\\" She was one of the first witnesses in a state case that has drawn national attention. The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and other groups are asking a judge to knock the state's tough new voter-ID law off the books before it can be used in the Nov. 6 election. Attorneys for Applewhite and nine other voters argued Wednesday that the law violated the state constitution by imposing unfair burdens on voters and could disenfranchise as many as a million or more Pennsylvanians - especially those who are old, poor, or disabled. The lawyers also disputed the law's stated purpose of preventing vote fraud, and repeatedly pointed to state officials' written stipulation that they planned to present no evidence of in-person voter impersonation, either in Pennsylvania or elsewhere, nor evidence that \\"in-person voter fraud is likely to occur in November 2012 in the absence of the photo-ID law.\\" That leaves only one explanation for the Republican-backed law, the civil liberties groups contend: to help sway elections in favor of one political party, in a presidential election year and in a state often described as a key battleground. In court, ACLU lawyers pointed to a widely quoted June 23 remark by State House Majority Leader Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny) at a Republican Party meeting. Turzai said the new voter-ID law \\"is going to allow Gov. Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania.\\" Turzai's spokesman later said he simply meant the law leveled the playing field for GOP presidential candidates. \\"The real purpose of this law is partisan advantage,\\" said David Gersch, a Washington-based lawyer representing Applewhite and the other plaintiffs. Gersch added: \\"We will show that the integrity of the electoral process is not enhanced by turning away people at the ballot box.\\" The state's lawyer, Senior Deputy Attorney General Patrick Cawley, argued that the law was not burdensome. He said having a photo ID has become \\"a widespread part of American life,\\" adding that voters have been given ample time and opportunity to obtain the necessary identification to vote. Cawley said the Department of State, which oversees Pennsylvania elections, was conducting a massive public-education campaign to let all voters know what was required. That campaign will include a blast of radio, television, and print ads, as well as letters notifying voters of the new law. He noted, too, that the state Department of Transportation is providing free photo IDs to those who need one. And because those IDs require some voters to dig up several official documents, such as birth certificates, he pointed out what the state announced Friday - a new voting-only ID card that would require less paperwork to obtain. \\"A great many hurdles have already been removed from the path of voters who want to vote,\\" Cawley argued. He said writing laws to regulate elections was very much within the legislature's purview. And he downplayed the significance his adversaries were attaching to the state's written stipulation that it would not offer evidence of past voter fraud. That stipulation, Cawley said, merely acknowledges that the legislature needed no proof of such crimes to pass the new law. \\"We are not here to judge the wisdom of the voter-ID law,\\" said Cawley, adding that the burden was on civil liberties groups to prove that the law would cause \\"irreparable harm.\\" The decision on whether to enjoin the law before the presidential election lies with Judge Robert Simpson, who reminded everyone at the start of what is expected to be five to seven days of hearings that he would not have the last word. He said he expected to decide by mid-August - and also expected his decision to be appealed to the state Supreme Court. \\"Take heart,\\" said Simpson. \\"I am not the last level of review.\\" He heard testimony from six voters who said they faced real hurdles in getting the photo IDs the law requires. Cawley asked witnesses if they knew their Social Security numbers; each did. That would help them obtain the new ID cards the state is promising. The plaintiffs' lawyers asked each if they had received notification of the new law from the state. Only one had. Applewhite said she was born Viviette Brooks but got a new last name when the father of her boyfriend for 22 years, Thomas Applewhite of Mississippi, adopted her. \\"They wanted to make sure I got the property and things when everybody died,\\" she testified. Her lawyers said Applewhite would not be able to obtain a PennDot photo-ID card because her purse was snatched several years ago - and along with it, her Social Security card, a photo ID from the State of Virginia, and her birth certificate. She testified that she had spent five years trying to replace the stolen documents and that only her birth certificate had been found. ||||| A similar strategy has succeeded in Missouri and Wisconsin, where judges have relied on voting rights protections enshrined in state constitutions to block laws that require voters to present photo identification. Voting rights advocates are scrambling to fight a rush of legislation adopted over the past two years that, among other changes, curtail the availability of early voting and impose new requirements on voter-registration efforts. Most attention has been focused on requirements that voters show photo identification, a measure that strikes many people as a common-sense notion that voters prove they are who they say they are. Many states require some method of identification, but 10, including Pennsylvania, have passed laws requiring specific kinds of government-issued IDs. “The integrity of the electoral process is not enhanced by turning away people at the ballot box,” said David Gersch, an attorney for 10 individuals and three groups, including the NAACP and the League of Women Voters. “Voting is not a privilege. It’s a right.” Although the court battles are waged in lawyers’ words, the partisan import of the laws is impossible to ignore. President Obama’s supporters argue that the legislation could cause serious harm to his reelection campaign. And all but one of the new measures have come in states with Republican-led legislatures. Democratic governors have vetoed some changes. Lawyers challenging the Pennsylvania law asked Simpson to note that state House Majority Leader Mike Turzai (R) listed the law as an accomplishment at a meeting of GOP activists. “Voter ID — which is going to allow governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania — done,” he said. Sponsors say the laws are needed to combat voter fraud and assure the public that only qualified voters’ ballots will be counted. In opening arguments Wednesday, Senior Deputy Attorney General Patrick Cawley told Simpson that “widespread disenfranchisement will not happen” and that “nothing could be more rational” than requiring a voter to show a photo ID. But evidence of the kind of voting fraud the laws would discourage is elusive. Pennsylvania stipulated before the trial that it could not show evidence of such fraud in the past and that it is unlikely to occur in the absence of the law. Opponents say the laws disproportionately affect minorities, the poor and the elderly, who even in a modern world sometimes lack photo identification and the legal documents and means that would allow them to obtain it. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 93-year-old Viviette Applewhite testified against a new state law that requires voters to present photo identification at the polls, as she no longer possesses a valid photo ID due to a purse-snatcher.

Opponents contend that the law's true purpose is to give the Republican party an advantage in swing state Pennsylvania. The state's lawyer maintains that the law is not burdensome and that having a photo ID is a common aspect of American life. The decision on whether the law should be enforced lies with Judge Robert Simpson, who expects to reach a decision by mid-August, but noted that his decision may be appealed to the state Supreme Court."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, New Hampshire. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location.

Sentence 2: In the comic thriller , \`\` Edward Trencom 's Nose '' by Giles Milton , several of Edward 's ancestors are poisoned , along with Byron . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"While the two sentences are similar in content, they do not convey the exact same information due to the difference in the subjects being portrayed as poisoned. In Sentence 1, the statement suggests that several of Byron's ancestors are poisoned, along with Edward. Here, the main subject being described as poisoned is Byron's ancestors, and Edward is included as an additional person affected. The focus is on the harmful event that has happened to Byron's ancestors, with Edward Trencom being a part of that event. Sentence 2, on the other hand, implies that the poisoning has happened to several of Edward's ancestors, along with Byron. In this case, the primary victims are Edward's ancestors, while Byron is added as an extra person who had also been poisoned in whatever event took place. The focus shifts to Edward Trencom's ancestors and their misfortune, with Byron simply being connected to the event. To summarize, the key difference lies in which character's ancestors are the main subject of the poisoning incident. In the first sentence, it focuses on Byron's ancestors, while in the second sentence, the focus had shifted to Edward's ancestors. Although both sentences mention the same characters (Edward, Byron, and their ancestors), the distinction lies in the context and who is being highlighted in each sentence. This subtle difference may change the reader's interpretation of the storyline and the characters' connection to the events in the comic thriller, \\"Edward Trencom's Nose\\" by Giles Milton."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the title, this first follow-up to QUARTET (1948) obviously reduces the number of W. Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but there’s no epilogue this time around; by the way, while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff, here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation, as well as Noel Langley (though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). As can be expected, much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely Naunton Wayne, Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled “The Colonel’s Lady”). While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time), it’s still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain. “The Verger” tells of a church sexton (James Hayter) – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (Michael Hordern) simply because he’s illiterate. Rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife (his landlady, played by Kathleen Harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and, with business flourishing, this is developed into a whole chain. The last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of Hayter’s lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger! The second episode, “Mr. Know-All”, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (Nigel Patrick), British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife (Anne Crawford). During a fancy-dress party, however, the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate)!; still, it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by Crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation, Wayne challenges Patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford’s position if he were to tell, so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! As can also be deduced from the title, “Sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by Andre' Morell; the protagonist is a new intern, Roland Culver, who wistfully observes the various goings-on. The narrative, in fact, highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous (the ‘feud’ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium, played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie), one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between naïve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which, in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a ‘lifer’ while Rennie only has a few years left to him, leads the couple to the altar). Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review seems to have a generally positive outlook on the movie. Although the reviewer considers TRIO to be a \\"lesser achievement\\" than its predecessor QUARTET, they still mention that it is \\"done with the utmost care\\", \\"acted with verve by a stellar cast\\", and is \\"solidly enjoyable\\".

Write an article that answers the following question: How many points were converted from Phillips interception?","completion":"Title: How Many Points Were Converted From Phillips' Interception? Hey little buddy! I heard you have a question about something that happened in a football game. You want to know how many points were converted from Phillips' interception, right? I'll be more than happy to help you understand! First, let's talk about what an \\"interception\\" is. In the game of football, one team tries to pass the ball to their teammates. But sometimes, a player from the other team, like Phillips, can be sneaky and catch the ball instead. When this happens, we call it an \\"interception\\" because they've stopped the other team's progress. Now, when a player intercepts the ball, it doesn't automatically give their team points. After the interception, Phillips' team gets a chance to start playing from that spot on the field. They will then try to move the ball down to the other end, and if they can cross the goal line, they might score some points! There are a few ways to score points in football: 1. Touchdown: When a team gets the ball into the other team's end zone, they score a touchdown, which is worth 6 points. 2. Extra Point: After scoring a touchdown, the team can kick the ball through the goal posts to earn 1 extra point. 3. Two-point Conversion: Instead of kicking the ball for an extra point, the team can try to get the ball back into the end zone again for 2 extra points. 4. Field Goal: If a team can't score a touchdown, they might try to kick the ball through the goal posts from further away. That's called a field goal, and it's worth 3 points. So, to find out how many points were converted from Phillips' interception, we would need to know what happened after the interception. Did his team score a touchdown? Did they get any extra points or a field goal? Remember, an interception by itself doesn't give a team any points. The points come from what the team does after they get the ball. I hope that helps you understand the game a little bit better, and maybe now you can find the answer to your question by looking at what happened during that specific game. Keep on enjoying football and learning new things!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

He joins a stagecoach transporting a newly-wed couple, John and Mary Newlie, who are traveling to Mexico to preach Christianity. Meanwhile, Johnny Madrid, a dangerous local outlaw, escapes from the gallows and kidnaps his hangman's beautiful daughter, Esmeralda. Madrid receives assistance from Reece, a young woman who wants to become Madrid's apprentice as an outlaw. With the hangman and a local posse on their trail, Madrid meets with his gang. They later rob Bierce's stagecoach because of Reece's belief that Bierce possesses an invaluable object. The object turns out to be the manuscript for Bierce's new book. Annoyed by this, Madrid leaves Reece to die in the desert. She is found by the posse who use her to track the two. As night falls, all the parties coincidentally seek shelter in an isolated inn that also serves as a whorehouse. They meet Ezra Traylor, a businessman heading to the U.S. The hangman is the only one who knows that the establishment is run by a group of vampires led by the high priestess, Quixtla, who targets Esmeralda.

Question: where is mint mark on liberty standing half I found the following answer on Google: Weinman's design of Liberty striding towards the Sun for the half dollar proved difficult to perfect, and Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo , whose department included the Mint, considered having Barber create his own design. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the provided information does not directly answer the question about the location of the mint mark on a Liberty Standing half dollar. While it offers interesting background information about the coin's design process, it does not specifically address the mint mark's location. Regarding the mint mark on a Liberty Standing Half Dollar, it is important to understand the role and significance of mint marks on coins. Mint marks indicate which U.S. Mint facility produced a particular coin, and can often contribute to a coin's rarity and value. The Liberty Standing Half Dollar, also known as the Walking Liberty Half Dollar, was produced from 1916 to 1947. The coin's obverse, or front side, features a design by sculptor Adolph A. Weinman of Lady Liberty striding towards the Sun, hence its name. Now, let's address the question. The mint mark's location on a Liberty Standing Half Dollar depends on the specific year it was produced: 1. For coins minted from 1916 to 1917, the mint mark is located on the obverse side, near the bottom-left edge, just below the motto \\"IN GOD WE TRUST.\\" 2. For coins minted from 1917 to 1947, the mint mark is located on the reverse side, or back side, near the bottom-left edge, below the branch held by the eagle. Three different U.S. Mint facilities produced the Liberty Standing Half Dollar during its minting period: Philadelphia (no mint mark), Denver (mint mark \\"D\\"), and San Francisco (mint mark \\"S\\"). Keep in mind that not every year's half dollar was minted at all three facilities, with some years exclusive to only one or two mints. In conclusion, the mint mark's location on a Liberty Standing Half Dollar varies depending on the year it was produced, and it is crucial to note where to look to determine the exact origins and value of the coin in question."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In English, this sentence translates to \\"I am going to marry this woman.\\" This sentence clearly indicates an individual's intention to marry a specific woman. The verb 'ožením' is in the future tense, suggesting a commitment or plan that will happen in the forthcoming time. On top of this, the use of 'Touhle ženou' (this woman) signifies his clear intent regarding who the person he plans to marry is, as opposed to an abstract or non-identified person. It is also worth noting that the Czech language, like other Slavic languages, uses the reflexive pronoun 'se' before verbs in many instances, similar to the way 'myself' or 'itself' might be used in English, which further emphasizes that the speaker is the one undertaking the action of the verb. So in this case, it intensifies the fact that the speaker intends to marry the woman of his own accord. In sum, this sentence is a strong, direct statement of intention regarding his future marital plans. Additionally, the sentence might convey not only a future plan, but also a strong emotional bond, desire and dedication towards the said woman. This might be perceived in a romantic context, where the speaker voluntarily declares his future steps, indicating that he has made a long-term, profound decision about his life that involves a deep relationship with the woman in question, who could be his girlfriend, fiancée, or someone he has deep feelings for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Trolley Man: Michael Rogers has been the silent hero since the Melbourne attack. The homeless man who decided to arm himself with a trolley and stand with police against a terrorist (7News) Trolly man : Michael Rogers has been the silent hero since the Melbourne attack (7News) 2:04 A bystander dubbed “the trolley man” for taking on an armed terrorist with a shopping cart during the deadly terror attack in Melbourne says he is “no hero” as his story comes to light. Michael Rogers, 46, attempted to help police officers stop Hassan Khalif Shire Ali during Friday’s Bourke Street terror attack. One person had already been stabbed to death and another two were injured. Mr Rogers, who is homeless with few possessions, began ramming a shopping trolley into the terrorist in a bid to help. “I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn’t quite get him down, though. I’m no hero,” Mr Rogers told Seven News’ Robert Ovadia from the scene of the attack. Mr Ovadia later told the program, “people think he deserves some sort of award for being a hero. He doesn’t see himself necessarily as a hero but believes he did help save lives and defend his city as well.” Subscribe to news.com.au’s From The Newsroom podcast A GoFundMe has since been set up for Mr Rogers, raising 105,130 at time of publication. The fundraiser was created by Melbourne Homeless Collective, a registered charity that supports people experiencing homelessness. “All funds donated to this campaign will go directly to Mr Rogers to help get him back on his feet,” the page reads. “He’s a hero in our eyes and he can do what he feels best with any funds he receives. He risked his own life that day for nothing in return and you can’t put a price on that.” The charity had originally set a goal of 5000 but has since said it will no longer set a target due to the overwhelming amount of support. “We’re absolutely blown away by everyone’s generosity and spirit in helping our hero ‘Trolleyman’ get back on his feet,” the charity said. “We don’t actually have a set target to reach but due to the incredible generosity we’ve seen so far we’ll keep increasing the total accordingly. “We’ve far surpassed our original goal. Let’s aim for the sky. Our hero absolutely deserves it.” The Sunday Herald Sun tracked down Mr Rogers on a park bench, amid a nationwide bid to find the humble hero, just 24 hours after he risked his life to save others. The newspaper reported that Mr Rogers is homeless, but wasn’t concerned when his phone was smashed during the fight, despite not having the means to replace it. Mr Rogers was one of two bystanders who stepped in as the killer tried to claim more victims in the city. Witness footage of the incident uploaded to social media showed Mr Rogers running to one side of the street to get the trolley before pushing it towards Ali who was wielding a knife and lunging at police. A man with a shopping trolley twice tried to ram the man to stop him. Another was wielding a chair. Incredible bravery @theheraldsun pic.twitter.com/w473DKA4wr — Josh Fagan (@faganjosh) November 9, 2018 The trolley appeared to startle Ali before the man who pushed it tripped and fell to the ground. The terrorist then ran across the road, followed by police, as Mr Rogers got up and gave chase, pushing his cart towards the attacker a second time. His actions gained him widespread praise on social media by users who dubbed him “trolley man” and called for him to receive a medal or be made Prime Minister of Australia. Mr Rogers was reportedly unaware of the attention being heaped on him for his actions. One witness said she spoke to Mr Rogers at the scene and he told her his actions were “just instinctive to help the police protect the safety of others”, the Herald Sun reports. Mr Rogers told 7 News that he believes he did help save lives. “I’ve seen the trolley to the side so I’ve picked it up and I ran, threw the trolley straight at him, got him, but didn’t get him down,” he said. “I did that motion quite a number of times but it just wasn’t getting him down.” ⚡️ Melbourne: “I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn't quite get him down, though. I’m no hero” - Michael Rogers. 7 News has spoken exclusively to “trolley man”, a bystander being hailed a hero following Friday’s terror attack. #TrolleyMan #7News pic.twitter.com/K0v3OXAwe0 — 7 News Sydney (@7NewsSydney) November 10, 2018 Moments later, Ali was shot in the chest by police, before he died in hospital last night. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Somali-born attacker, from Melbourne’s northwestern suburbs, had violated the nation’s trust. “The greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,” he said. Mr Morrison said Ali was one of about 400 people on a national ASIO terror watch list. “Here in Australia we would be kidding ourselves if we did not call out the fact that the greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,” Mr Morrison said. “There is a special responsibility on religious leaders to protect their religious communities and to ensure dangerous teachings and ideologies do not take root here.” In a press conference on Saturday, Victoria Police confirmed Ali had been known to intelligence agencies for years, but he was not being actively monitored prior to the attack. They said his passport was cancelled in 2015 after ASIO determined he was planning to travel to Syria. ||||| Uodate 17/11/2018 We’ve reached our goal!

The incident saw Hassan Khalif Shire Ali stabbing one person to death and injuring two others on Bourke Street. Rogers used the trolley to ram Ali multiple times, attempting to subdue him. Despite being lauded as a hero, Rogers has maintained that he is no such thing, rather, he was just trying to help. After the event, a GoFundMe campaign was launched for Rogers by the Melbourne Homeless Collective, a registered charity. The page dedicated to him raised over 105,130. The charity had initially set a goal of 5000 but received such an outpour of support that it decided not to set a limit. The funds will be used to help Rogers get back on his feet. The charity has expressed that, in their eyes, Rogers is a hero, and he has the freedom to do what he thinks is best with the money. Social media users also praised Rogers's bravery, dubbing him the \\"trolley man\\" and calling for him to receive a medal or even be made Prime Minister of Australia. He was, reportedly, unaware of the attention he was receiving for his actions. He described his bravery as instinctual and said he believes his actions helped save lives. Ali was later shot in the chest by the police and died in the hospital. The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, used the occasion to address religious extremism, particularly \\"extremist Islam\\". It was reported that Ali was on a national ASIO terror watch list and had intended to travel to Syria before his passport was cancelled in 2015. The Melbourne Homeless Collective continued to support Rogers after reaching the fundraising goal, providing him with a new phone to replace the one smashed during the incident. They also reassured donors that 100% of the funds raised would directly benefit Rogers and help guide him financially as he moves forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Before winning his first NBA championship with the warriors, who joined the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament? The answer is:","completion":"Before winning his first NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors, Jameer Nelson joined the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament. Jameer Nelson, a talented point guard, played college basketball for the Saint Joseph's University Hawks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he had an illustrious career. He was a part of the Atlantic 10 Conference, a league known for producing numerous professional basketball players. In the 2002-03 season, Nelson helped lead the Saint Joseph's Hawks to an impressive performance in the regular season and eventually the Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament. In the 2003 Atlantic 10 Tournament, the Hawks had a remarkable run, making it to the championship game against the University of Dayton Flyers. Throughout the tournament, Nelson showcased his exceptional basketball skills and leadership qualities that would later help him succeed in the NBA. Although the Hawks ultimately lost to Dayton in the championship game, Nelson's performance did not go unnoticed. As a result of his outstanding play and significant contributions to the team's success, Jameer Nelson was named to the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament. This achievement added to his already impressive college basketball resume, which included being named the 2003-04 National College Player of the Year and a two-time consensus First Team All-American. Following his college career, Jameer Nelson was drafted by the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2004 NBA Draft with the 20th overall pick. However, his draft rights were traded to the Orlando Magic, where he would spend the majority of his NBA career. Over the years, he developed into an All-Star caliber player, earning a spot on the Eastern Conference All-Star team during the 2008-09 season. In 2018, Nelson achieved his first NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors, adding a professional championship to his collection of basketball accomplishments. Despite not having a significant role on that championship team, his journey from starring in college basketball to achieving success in the NBA is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and passion for the sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: 相比之下，旅鼠显着地着色并且对掠食者甚至人类观察者表现得很积极。 Output:","completion":"Par rapport à cela, le rat de voyage est nettement coloré et se montre très actif même en présence de prédateurs et d'observateurs humains. Explanation: Here is a step-by-step process to this translation: 1. 相比之下 --> Par rapport à cela: Translates literally to \\"Compared to this,\\" but a closer French idiom would be \\"Par rapport à cela\\" which means \\"In comparison to this\\". 2. 旅鼠 --> le rat de voyage: This term translates directly to \\"travel rat\\", but in French, the adjective comes after the noun, so it becomes \\"le rat de voyage\\". 3. 显着地着色 --> est nettement coloré: \\"显着的\\" means 'obviously' or 'noticeably' and \\"着色\\" means 'colored'. So combined, it means \\"noticeably colored\\", a phrase which can be translated to French as \\"est nettement coloré\\". 4. 并且 --> et: This conjunction simply translates to \\"and\\" 5. 对掠食者 --> face aux prédateurs: This phrase means \\"towards predators\\". But, in French, an equivalent phrase would be \\"face aux prédateurs\\" which translates to 'in the face of predators'. 6. 甚至人类观察者 --> même les observateurs humains: \\"甚至\\" implies 'even' and \\"人类观察者\\" translates to 'human observers'. The expression 'even human observers' in French can be stated as \\"même les observateurs humains\\". 7. 表现得很积极 --> se montre très actif: This phrase translates to \\"appears very active\\". The word \\"表现\\" means 'display' or 'show', \\"得很\\" implies 'very' and \\"积极\\" translates to 'positive' or 'active'. All of these words together can be translated to 'shows great positivity' or 'appears very active'. The French equivalent would be \\"se montre très actif\\" which literally means 'shows itself to be very active'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the latter years of the 20th century the opera was a regular feature in many European cities, and was still breaking new ground; in 1990 it made its debut at the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava. Vienna saw it for the first time in 1994, at the Vienna Volksoper, in what John Rockwell in the New York Times described as \\"an awkwardly updated production\\", though well performed. The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916, performances had been rare compared with Europe. Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before reviving it. In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and staged it again in 1983 and 1986. Reviewing the 1986 production, Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the \\"melodic suppleness and warmth\\" of Bizet's score.San Diego Opera first staged the work in 1993, but it was this company's 2004 production, designed by Zandra Rhodes, that generated new levels of enthusiasm for the opera throughout the United States. In the following few years this production was shown in seven other U.S. opera houses; in October 2008 James C. Whitson, in Opera News, reported that worldwide, \\"between 2007 and 2009, half of all major production of the piece have been or will be ... in the U.S.\\".

Article: Do you get angry when your friends sing loudly while you are trying to work, or when your best friend does not wait for you after school? If you do, you need to take control of your feelings and stop getting angry so easily. Getting angry with people can cause you to lose friends. Gray Gerber, an American high school teacher, has written My Feelings Are Like Wild Animals to help you control your feelings. It tells teens how to stay cool when bad things happen to them. The book says that getting angry only makes problems worse. It can never make them better. Getting angry is not a natural way to act, the book says. It is just a bad habit, like smoking. The book says you can control your anger easily. All you have to do is tell yourself not to be angry. When a baby falls over, he only cries if people are watching him. Like a baby, you should only get angry if you are sure it is the right thing to do. The book gives many tips to help you if you get angry easily. Here are our tips: (1)Keep a record. Every time you get angry, write down why you are angry. (2)Ask your friends to stop talking to you when you get angry. This will teach you not to be angry. (3)Do something different. When you get angry, walk away from the problem and go somewhere else. Try to laugh.

It identifies both smoking and getting angry as detrimental habits that we can consciously overcome. The passage points out that getting angry is not a natural response, but rather a learned behavior that can be unlearned.

The passage also provides tips on how to manage anger, which include keeping a record of instances when one got angry, requesting friends to refrain from interacting when one is angry, and advising to divert attention or physically move away from an infuriating environment. Therefore, the passage mainly covers how to control our feelings and illustrates its importance.

Available options: + negative. + positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .","completion":"The phrase \\"attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one\\" can be considered both positive and negative depending on how it is interpreted and the context in which it is used. Here is a detailed analysis of both the positive and negative aspects of this phrase. Positive interpretation: 1. Effort: The phrase implies that someone is putting an effort to improve the quality of something (in this case, a storyline). They are not merely settling for dull plots but attempting to combine them to create something better. This attitude of striving for betterment can be considered positive. 2. Creativity: Combining three dull plots into one could require innovative ideas and creativity. This showcases the individual's or the team's creative and problem-solving skills, which can be perceived as a positive aspect. 3. Potential improvement: The phrase suggests that there is room for improvement, and the final output might have a chance of being better than the initial dull plots. This potential for improvement can be seen as positive, as it demonstrates progress and a willingness to elevate the original material. Negative interpretation: 1. Dull plots: The most notable aspect of this phrase is the use of the term \\"dull plots,\\" which implies that the storylines being combined are not interesting or engaging. This can be considered a negative point. 2. Lack of individual quality: By referencing the need to combine three dull plots into one good one, the phrase suggests that none of the original plots is strong enough to stand on its own. This lack of individual quality can be perceived as a weakness, indicating a negative aspect. 3. Uncertainty of success: The phrase only mentions the \\"attempt\\" to fuse these plots, not the successful fusion of them. This means it is uncertain whether the final product would indeed be a good one, and the attempt could potentially prove futile, making this aspect negative. In conclusion, the phrase \\"attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one\\" contains elements that can be considered both positive (effort, creativity, potential improvement) and negative (dull plots, lack of individual quality, uncertainty of success). The overall interpretation of this phrase would depend on the context, tone, and intention behind its usage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is Ned's garden at more or less risk of hypoxia than Bobby's garden? Hint: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.

The workers were cleaning and it must've spilt on the counter or something. And Lastly, the workers are just straight up RUDE!!!! They were too into talking amongst themselves than helping customers. One of them asked if it was my first time in the store and I said 'yes' so I was hoping he'd explain a lot of things to me but he didn't. He was sooo pushy that it made me very uncomfortable. I was still browsing around the store and he was starting to ringing me up. I was testing out the eyeliners when he shouted across the store with my total cost.

Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is an American retired professional basketball player and current president of basketball operations of the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played point guard for the Lakers for 13 seasons. After winning championships in high school and college, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers. He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson and Larry Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers-Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning. Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson-Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness (\\"Showtime\\") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit (\\"Celtic Pride\\"), and between blacks and whites. The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy. Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 Converse shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a \\"friend forever\\"; during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival. In 2009, Johnson and Bird collaborated with journalist Jackie MacMullan on a non-fiction book titled When the Game Was Ours. The book detailed their on-court rivalry and friendship with one another.

A:","completion":"Yes, both XLR8R and Dragon magazines are publications that cater to different interests and niches. While they share the basic characteristic of being magazines, their content, target audience, and purpose differ significantly. Here's an overview of each magazine to provide more context: XLR8R Magazine: XLR8R (pronounced \\"accelerator\\") is a magazine that primarily focuses on electronic music, technology, culture, and the individuals who impact these fields. Founded in 1993 by Andrew Rawnsley and Jennifer Howell in San Francisco, California, the magazine initially covered a range of diverse musical genres like hip-hop, indie rock, and electronic music. Over time, XLR8R's focus narrowed to predominantly electronic music and related culture, giving rise to its unique identity. The publication covers various aspects of electronic music, including interviews with artists, album and event reviews, news, and exclusive music releases. Additionally, XLR8R explores the technology used by DJs and music producers, offering insights into the latest gear, software, and techniques. Though XLR8R initially began as a print magazine, it transitioned to an online-only format in 2011. The digital platform continues to attract a large audience of music enthusiasts, industry professionals, and musicians seeking the latest insights into the world of electronic music. Dragon Magazine: Dragon Magazine, on the other hand, was a publication dedicated mainly to role-playing games (RPGs), specifically focusing on the popular game \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" (D&D). Launched in 1976 by TSR, Inc., the magazine aimed to provide a platform for game-related content, including articles, artwork, and stories. Dragon Magazine catered to players, dungeon masters, and fans of the D&D role-playing game, offering valuable resources such as new game mechanics, background information on characters and settings, dungeon and adventure modules, and tips for enhancing gameplay. It also featured articles that delved into general fantasy themes and other role-playing games. The magazine initially began as a bi-monthly publication, but its growing popularity led to a monthly release schedule. In 2007, the print version of Dragon Magazine was discontinued, and its content was transitioned to an online format as part of Wizards of the Coast's digital initiative. It was eventually discontinued in 2013 due to a strategic rebranding and has now been replaced by Dragon+, a mobile app supplementing the Dungeons & Dragons experience. In conclusion, both XLR8R and Dragon magazines are indeed publications, but they cater to distinctly different interests. XLR8R focuses on electronic music and culture, while Dragon Magazine was devoted to role-playing games, more specifically the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy game. Despite their contrasting niches, both publications have contributed to their respective fields and cultivated passionate communities around their content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. and the situation: A scientist, John, has two containers of the same noble gas. John sends electricity through container A. Just as he is about to activate the electricity for container B, the power goes out, and he is unable to do so. Frustrated, John goes to find the circuit breaker to see if a fuse has blown. Answer the following question: Will the gas in container A have a higher or lower energy level than container B? Answer:","completion":"The gas in container A will have a higher energy level than container B. This is because the electricity sent through container A energizes the electrons in the noble gas, causing them to jump to a higher energy level. Since container B did not have electricity sent through it, its electrons remain at their original energy level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first lady continued, “One of the things I don’t do well is this.” Then she left the podium to confront the heckler, face-to-face. Some claim what followed was a childish temper tantrum on the part of the first lady. I say she stood up for herself and for the paying audience’s right to hear the rest of her remarks. The audio from the event is difficult to make out, but according to the pool reporter at the event, Obama said, “Listen to me or you can take the mike, but I’m leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.” The heckler was escorted out and Obama returned to her speech. “So let me make the point that I was making before: We are here for our kids.” The audience applauded. Obama sounded, to me, very much like the “mom-in-chief” that she’s said is her primary role. Salon’s Mary Elizabeth Williams pointed out the first lady reacted in a mom-like way. “It was the determined tone of a woman who, swear to God, will turn this car around right now if you can’t control yourselves.” The heckler, later identified as Ellen Sturtz, 56, a lesbian activist from GetEqual, wants President Obama to sign an executive order that would prohibit discrimination against sexual orientation or gender identity by federal contractors. She paid 500 for admission to the event held at the home of a lesbian couple. In a statement from GetEqual, Sturtz said, “…as the First Lady was talking about our children’s future and ensuring that they have everything they need to live happy and productive lives, I simply couldn’t stay silent any longer.” I’m all for free speech. And for ending discrimination of all kinds. But was this the appropriate time or place for Sturtz to push her agenda? Don Q. Beggs, a friend of mine in Kansas City, Mo. and a friend who happens to be gay and who agrees with Sturtz’s position, didn’t think so. “As a gay person, I was disappointed that the heckler targeted the first lady who doesn’t set policy, targeted the first lady because she is for equality, and targeted the first lady during an improper forum (on children’s issues),” Beggs told me. He stressed, “I do, however, agree with the heckler – just not the time and place.” Change has been a constant theme of the Obama Administration since the campaign. Change was a theme of Michelle Obama’s speech Tuesday night. But change sometimes takes time. And patience. And maybe it wouldn’t hurt to be polite when you want something.

Some landlords, especially those who are part of major rental companies, accept credit card payments with little to no hassle. However, many small and independent landlords do not because of the additional fees involved.","completion":"In this paragraph, the author is discussing how to pay rent using a credit card. The first step is to inquire if the landlord accepts credit card payments. Moving forward, various scenarios may unfold, which can be elaborated as follows. 1. The landlord accepts credit card payments: If the landlord accepts credit card payments, it is important to find out the specific procedure and requirements. This could involve setting up an online account through the rental company's website or utilizing a third-party service that processes the payments. In this case, make sure to ask about any additional fees, associated risks, and the turnaround time for your payment to be processed and applied to your rental account. 2. The landlord does not accept credit card payments directly but recommends a third-party payment platform: If your landlord does not accept credit card payments directly but allows tenants to use a third-party platform (like Plastiq, RentMoola, or RadPad), you will need to set up an account on that platform. Research the chosen platform, sign up, link your credit card, and follow the instructions to make your rent payment. Keep in mind that these platforms often charge fees, which could range from 2% to 3% or more of the transaction amount. Weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this option before deciding if it is right for you. 3. The landlord does not accept credit card payments: If your landlord does not accept credit card payments, discuss alternative payment options. These may include paying by check, direct bank transfer, or a money order. If you are insistent on using your credit card, explore the possibility of services that allow you to make payments for a fee and send a check on your behalf. Always consider the cost and convenience of these methods in comparison to more traditional payment methods. 4. Weigh the pros and cons of using a credit card for rent: Using a credit card to pay your rent has both advantages and drawbacks. On the plus side, you may be able to earn rewards or cash back, build your credit, and leverage the spending power in case of a temporary cash crunch. On the downside, additional processing fees can be expensive, and mismanaging your finances or failing to pay off your credit card balance could lead to debt and negatively impact your credit score. Analyze your financial situation and habits before using a credit card for rent payments. 5. Keep track of your payments and communicate with your landlord: Regardless of the method you choose to pay your rent, be sure to keep records of all transactions, such as confirmation emails or receipts. Maintain open communication with your landlord to ensure your payments are received and credited on time. Notify the landlord of any issues that might arise, such as delays in processing or disputes over fees. In summary, the next steps involve finding out if your landlord accepts credit card payments, exploring third-party platforms, discussing alternative payment methods, weighing the pros and cons, and keeping track of your transactions. Evaluating your options and making an informed decision will help you maintain a positive relationship with your landlord and avoid unnecessary costs and complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"The Holy Sepulchre is the stone slab where Jesus' body was placed.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it does follow that \\"The Holy Sepulchre is the stone slab where Jesus' body was placed.\\" The Holy Sepulchre, also known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or the Church of the Resurrection, is a famous and sacred Christian site located in the Old City of Jerusalem. The site is believed to be the place where Jesus Christ was crucified, buried, and resurrected. This site holds immense religious and historical significance for Christians worldwide, as it commemorates the pivotal events in Jesus' life, which are central to Christian theology. The Holy Sepulchre is not just a single stone slab. It is a church complex housing numerous significant locations related to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. The stone slab, referred to as the \\"Stone of Anointment\\" or the \\"Stone of Unction,\\" is where Jesus' body is believed to have been anointed and prepared for burial. This stone is an integral part of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and holds immense religious value for devout Christians who visit the site. There are several other prominent locations within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre complex, such as: - Golgotha: Also known as Calvary, this is the site where Jesus was crucified. The exact spot is now marked by an altar inside the church. Visitors can reach a touch hole beneath the altar that allows them to touch the rock believed to be at the exact place of Christ's crucifixion. - The Tomb of Christ: The marble-encased tomb, also known as the Edicule, is believed to be the spot where Jesus' body was buried and later resurrected. The current structure surrounding the tomb dates back to the early 19th century, but the site itself has been a destination for Christian pilgrims since the 4th century. - The Chapel of St. Helena: This chapel is dedicated to St. Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine, who was responsible for the construction of the original church. It is believed that Helena discovered the True Cross, the cross on which Jesus was crucified, during her visit to Jerusalem. - The Prison of Christ: Though not universally accepted, some traditions suggest that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre houses the prison cell where Jesus was detained before his crucifixion. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre has gone through several transformations throughout its history, suffering from fires, earthquakes, and various reconstructions. Today, it remains a focal point for Christian pilgrims from various denominations, including Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, and others who come to venerate the events of Jesus' death and resurrection. So, in summary, it is accurate to state that \\"The Holy Sepulchre is the stone slab where Jesus' body was placed,\\" but it is essential to recognize that the Holy Sepulchre encompasses much more than just the stone slab, representing a significant religious site with a rich history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

David Monroe Shoup (30 December 1904 - 13 January 1983) was a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II, became the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, and, after retiring, became one of the most prominent critics of the Vietnam War. Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. David Monroe Shoup was born on 30 December 1904 in Battle Ground, Indiana. His family lived on a farm in Ash Grove, but moved to Covington to live on a new farm in 1916. At age 12 he was enrolled in Covington High School, a competitive high school with an advanced curriculum. Shoup was an excellent student, maintaining high marks in French, English, physics, and history. Additionally, he was involved in several extracurricular activities, including basketball, and was class president in his senior year. He graduated in 1921. He later affectionately referred to his impoverished upbringing as that of an \\"Indiana plowboy.\\" Regarded by friends as very sociable, he met Zola De Haven in his freshman year and later said he had been instantly attracted to her. They were both very competitive in academics and athletics, and the two dated throughout high school; they were married in 1931. After high school, Shoup attended DePauw University where he was one of 100 awarded the Edward Rector Scholarship, giving him full tuition. Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the selection criteria for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. He waited tables, washed dishes and worked in a cement factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his living expenses, and later recalled that this was the only reason he joined the military. He graduated from DePauw in 1926. From an early age, Shoup was molded by the progressive ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives fighting against the interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Where did Pa take them for lessons?

The vegetables seemed like they had seen better days, being wilted and discolored. To top it off, the bun was stale and almost inedible. 2. Service: The waitstaff seemed uninterested in providing a pleasant dining experience. It took nearly 20 minutes for our waiter to take our order and an additional 45 minutes for our food to arrive, with no apology for the wait. We also had to ask for refills on our drinks several times before someone attended to our request. 3. Atmosphere: The restaurant's atmosphere was not appealing at all. The lighting was too dim, making it difficult to read the menu or even see our food once it arrived. The music choice was loud and distracting, making conversation nearly impossible. 4. Pricing: For the poor quality of the food and the overall dining experience, I found it quite overpriced. Given the subpar offerings, I would have expected a lower price point. 5. Cleanliness: Lastly, the restaurant's cleanliness left much to be desired. I couldn't help but notice a layer of dust covering the windowsills and the tabletops felt sticky, suggesting they hadn't been cleaned properly. In conclusion, my visit to The Sloppy Burger was a major letdown. The food, service, atmosphere, pricing, and cleanliness all fell short of expectations.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

When we moved in a month ago, Mary wanted to get a dog to keep out burglars. However, we finally decided that it would be cheaper to put an iron grille in front of the door and get a burglar alarm. Last week, I went to a shop and bought an alarm for just over PS200. It consists of a control unit with three smaller units. I put the control unit in the lounge and put the other units in place by the front door, back door and lounge windows. That night I soon fell asleep because I was confident that no one could get into our house undetected. At about 1:50 a.m. I woke up suddenly and heard the siren. It was like an ambulance driving right through our bedroom. I couldn't leave the siren on all night. I went downstairs in the dark. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I switched on the light and looked around. Oh my gosh. The back door was unlocked. I rushed to lock it and it was just at that exact moment that the 'burglar' disappeared behind a curtain. Guess what? It was an ordinary house lizard .Apparently the alarm system had been made for American or European homes in which lizards are never seen. I switched the alarm off and sat down to watch.

That's what looks good to me in the sheriff's department. It's Western. It's Wyoming,' he said. Haskell argues the new uniform is for safety and uniformity reasons.","completion":"Title: Western Cowboy Hat Controversy Leads to Deputy's Retirement in Sublette County Introduction: In Sublette County, Wyoming, a change in the local sheriff's department dress code has led to the retirement of a long-serving deputy. Known for its Western vibe, the county is now witnessing a showdown between tradition and modernity in law enforcement attire. Body: Last month, newly-appointed Sublette County Sheriff Stephen Haskell imposed a change in the dress code within the department. This revamp was aimed at promoting safety and uniformity, but for some, it struck a blow against Western pride and tradition. The decision caused Deputy Gene Bryson, a veteran with 28 years in the department and 40 years in law enforcement, to retire last Friday. For Bryson, who is 70-years-old, the cowboy hat represented more than just a simple accessory. \\"I've had a cowboy hat on since 19. That's what looks good to me in the sheriff's department. It's Western. It's Wyoming,\\" he said. The cowboy hat encapsulates the spirit of the West, which is deeply entwined with the identity of both Sublette County and Wyoming as a whole. Despite the sentiment behind the deputy's decision, Sheriff Haskell remained unwavering in his stance. He argued that the new uniform was implemented for safety and uniformity reasons. While the traditional dress may be associated with pride and heritage, Haskell maintained that modern law enforcement requires a more streamlined and consistent look. The proposed uniform includes tactical attire and black baseball caps, which many believe will help project a unified front and foster a sense of camaraderie among officers. However, not everyone in the community supports the change. Some residents see the cowboy hat as an emblem of Western resilience and a cornerstone of the region's culture. For them, the shift to tactical gear represents a departure from the values and traditions they hold dear. Conclusion: The controversy surrounding the new dress code in Sublette County highlights the delicate balance between preserving local heritage and adapting to contemporary needs. As the clash between Deputy Gene Bryson's cowboy hat and Sheriff Stephen Haskell's modern uniform illustrates, traditions can often be difficult to let go. However, striking a compromise that acknowledges and respects both sides may be key to moving forward as a united law enforcement community in Sublette County and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety. Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the hygiene hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans. One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not. In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners. What do humans get exposed to with pets that may help them not get sick?","completion":"Humans get exposed to immune-stimulating microorganisms when they are in contact with pets, specifically dogs. These microorganisms play a significant role in boosting the immune system, thereby potentially helping humans not get sick. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that exposure to a diverse array of these microorganisms, which are commonly found in the environment as well as on the pets, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. These immune-stimulating microorganisms help humans develop a more robust and well-regulated immune response. By being exposed to these microbes, the human immune system gets trained to better differentiate between harmful and harmless substances. This, in turn, lowers the chances of unnecessary inflammatory responses, which are at the root of allergies and autoimmune diseases. In summary, contact with pets, specifically dogs, exposes humans to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can be beneficial in strengthening the immune system, reducing the risk of allergies and autoimmune diseases, and ultimately improving overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But more than 100,000 people - most of them women - do not reach that threshold, because they work for several employers. The government said that it is planning to review the issue later this year. A separate study shows that women still receive far smaller pensions than men. According to the insurance company Zurich, the average woman will have £47,000 less in her pension pot than a man by the time she retires. Citizens Advice said that 72,000 women were missing out on auto-enrolment pensions, which require employers to pay a pension automatically, unless a worker deliberately opts out. The charity said too many people were being shut out of the opportunity to be paid a pension. \\"Many people - particularly women - work several part time jobs, which helps them manage commitments like childcare or study,\\" said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. \\"But while in many cases they earn over £10,000, and pay tax on this combined income, they don't have access to a workplace pension and miss out on the opportunity to save for their retirement.\\" The government said in December that it would examine the issue of workers with multiple jobs when it reviews the auto-enrolment programme later this year. \\"There's more to do - especially for people with more than one job - and we're currently reviewing the policy to see how it can be improved,\\" a spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said. The Zurich analysis found that between 2013 and 2016 men received 7.8% of their salary in pension contributions on average, compared to women receiving 7%. It said men tend to work in sectors with more established or generous pension schemes. In addition, women are more likely to take career breaks. \\"This difference in the contributions that they receive from their employer presents a serious - and growing - problem,\\" said Rose St Louis, Zurich's head of partnership development. \\"The triple effect of smaller salaries, career breaks for women and lower contribution rates needs to be addressed: we can't ignore a £47,000 shortfall,\\" she said.","completion":"Over 100,000 workers, mainly women, miss out on auto-enrolment pensions due to working multiple jobs and not meeting the £10,000 annual earnings threshold from a single employer, creating significant gender disparities in pension savings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato's sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato. They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862. A:","completion":"The first name of the person who depicted the dignified aspects of war is Felice Beato.

Is The Holy Roman Empire comprised many petty states numbering more than 300 around 1796. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The Holy Roman Empire comprised many petty states numbering more than 300 around 1796\\" is a good starting point for answering the question. However, to provide a more detailed answer, it is important to expound on the nature of the Holy Roman Empire, its fragmentation, and the role of these petty states within the empire. The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic and complex political entity that existed from 962 to 1806 in Central Europe. At its peak, it included present-day Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, parts of Italy, and eastern France. It was neither a centralized state nor a unified empire, but rather a loose confederation of sovereign territories under the nominal control of a Holy Roman Emperor, who was elected by the prince-electors. The Empire was characterized by a highly fragmented political landscape, in which local rulers held considerable autonomy and power. By the late 18th century, around 1796, the Holy Roman Empire was a patchwork of more than 300 petty states, each with its own ruler, administration, and laws. These states varied greatly in size, population, and power, ranging from large and influential states like the kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony, to small ecclesiastical territories and independent city-states. The Holy Roman Empire's fragmentation can be traced back to its inception, when the decentralization of power was a key element of its governance structure. The Empire did not have a uniform legal or administrative system, which often led to internal competition and conflicts among its various territories. The volatilities between states were further exacerbated by the religious conflicts, notably the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century and the subsequent Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which greatly weakened the central authority and left local rulers to manage their own affairs. The Reichsdeputationshauptschluss (Imperial Recess) of 1803, often referred to as the \\"secularization\\" and \\"mediatization\\" of the Empire, saw the reorganization and redistribution of many of the small ecclesiastical territories, secularized monasteries and imperial cities within the realm. It was an attempt to simplify and consolidate power within the Empire. However, the Holy Roman Empire itself would be dismantled shortly thereafter, following Napoleon Bonaparte's campaigns in Central Europe. In 1806, the last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II, abdicated the throne and declared the dissolution of the Empire.

Question: What does the marques give the beggar? Movie title: The Curse of the Werewolf Movie plot: In Spain a cruel and arrogant Marques is wedding a young and beautiful maiden. During the elaborate celebration a beggar appears. After making fun of him, the marques gives the beggar some food and then has him thrown in the dungeon.The beggar becomes friends with the jailer and his young daughter. After the jailer died, the mute girl of his grows up to be a beautiful and voluptuous woman. The marques, now an old and disgusting looking widower, makes sexual advances toward her and she bites him and runs off. He then finds out who she is and has her thrown into the dungeon until she changes her mind about his advances. The beggar now is old and has gone completely mad. Shortly after she is thrown in with him, the beggar rapes her. She is let out and the marques pulls his old tricks again until she stabs him to death. The young mute ran until she passed out in a distant forest and was found by a kind man. He and his wife take care of her until she has the beggar's baby. The problem is that he is born on Christmas Morn at Midnight. That bears an awful curse that takes her life and causes her baby son to wear the mark of the beast. Years later, the young boy, still being raised by the couple, escapes their home some nights. On those nights, live stock is always slaughtered by a powerful beast. The couple finds out that it is Leon, their adopted son. A local priest tells then that he is a werewolf and that only love can calm the savage beast. The couple heeds the priest's advice and love keeps the beast at bay. Until that is, when Leon becomes a man and moves away for work. He falls for a young lady but then the beast takes over and Leon's demon emerges and starts to kill his fellows and his loves interest's fiance.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes.

Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse.

A:","completion":"Answer: Yes, the description provided is indeed a reasonable answer to the question about an agent's job role in the film industry. However, to offer a more detailed and comprehensive answer, let's delve deeper into the roles and responsibilities of talent agents in the film industry. A talent agent, also known as a booking agent or talent representative, serves as an intermediary between artists or professionals in the entertainment industry and potential employers or opportunities. Their primary function is to identify, negotiate, and secure work engagements for their clients, which include actors, authors, film directors, musicians, models, producers, professional athletes, writers, and other professionals in the realm of entertainment. In the film industry, a talent agent's job role typically involves the following responsibilities: 1. Talent Scouting and Acquisition: Agents proactively search for new and promising artists, evaluate their skills and potential, and sign them to their talent agency. They attend industry events, film festivals, and showcases to discover new talents and establish connections with potential clients. 2. Career Development: Talent agents provide guidance and advice to their clients on various aspects related to their careers in the film industry. They help actors in selecting appropriate roles and filmmakers in identifying suitable projects that align with their artistic vision and brand. They also advise clients on building their professional skills, creating a public image, and expanding their professional networks. 3. Promotion and Marketing: A key aspect of an agent's job is to promote their clients and their work. Agents create marketing materials, such as portfolios, showreels, and press kits, to showcase their clients' talents. They also utilize their networks and connections within the entertainment industry to garner exposure and secure opportunities for their clients. 4. Negotiation and Contract Management: Talent agents are responsible for negotiating contracts and agreements on behalf of their clients. They handle discussions with production companies, studios, and other potential employers to ensure that their clients receive fair compensation and favorable working conditions. They also work closely with entertainment lawyers in navigating the legal aspects of contracts and agreements. 5. Schedule Coordination: Agents work with their clients to manage their schedules and ensure that they are not overbooked or conflicting with other commitments. They coordinate audition times, meetings with filmmakers and producers, and various publicity and promotional events. 6. Problem Solving and Conflict Resolution: Talent agents often act as a liaison between their clients and various stakeholders in the film industry, such as production companies, studios, and other professionals. They handle grievances, disputes, and other issues that may arise during the course of projects or work engagements. 7. Networking and Relationship Building: An essential aspect of an agent's job is to establish and maintain relationships with key players in the entertainment industry, including producers, casting directors, studio executives, and other agents. These connections enable agents to stay abreast of new projects, potential job opportunities, and industry trends. In summary, an agent's job role in the film industry involves a combination of talent acquisition, career development, promotion and marketing, negotiation and contract management, schedule coordination, problem-solving and conflict resolution, and networking and relationship building.

Summarize: A letter signed by the prime minister on the green baize table of the cabinet room yesterday afternoon makes real the consequences of Britain's vote to leave the European Union nine months ago. Once the document arrives in Brussels at lunchtime, passed formally into the hands of the European Council, the triggering of Article 50 begins the process of Britain leaving the European Union - a partnership of nations in which the UK has played its own role for more than four decades - for good, or ill. The prime minister will promise later to represent every person in the country during what are likely to be fraught negotiations, including those EU nationals who have made their homes here, whose future is still uncertain. Theresa May will also urge the country to come together, hoping this moment could spell the end of a fractious debate between Leave and Remain. The government's main priorities are clear - withdrawing from European law, controlling immigration and striking a free trade deal from outside the European single market. Yet there are tensions in Parliament, in the prime minister's own party, between Holyrood and Westminster, and of course, among the public over what Britain's future could, or should look like outside the European Union. She, and we, have two years to work it out. Theresa May of course was a Remainer to start with, if not the most full-throated advocate for the EU during the referendum campaign. But after the bloody Tory infighting in the campaign's immediate aftermath, she is sometimes described as being the \\"last grown-up left standing\\". There are doubts in Westminster about the government's capacity to deal with the complexities of what lies ahead, doubts about the Tory Party's capability of sticking together when it gets tough, doubts about the opposition's ability to carry out the kind of intense scrutiny required while this vital set of decisions are debated and discussed over the next two years or so. Above all perhaps, doubts about whether what Theresa May is asking for is even vaguely realistic. What she does or does not achieve in these negotiations will determine her, and the country's, future. Summary:","completion":"The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, a decision made nine months prior, is solidified by a letter signed by Prime Minister Theresa May. Once this letter reaches Brussels, it formally instigates the commencement of Article 50, initiating the formal exit of the UK from the EU, a group of countries it has been partners with for more than 40 years. Prime Minister May pledges to represent all UK citizens during these potentially tense negotiations, including EU individuals who reside in the UK and who face a particularly unsure future. She will also make a nationwide call for unity, seeing this moment as an opportunity to end the rife and divisive debate between those who wished to leave and those who preferred to remain in the EU. The government has outlined its main focuses for future negotiations - the withdrawal from EU law, control over immigration, and securing a free trade agreement outside of the constraints of the European single market. However, the road ahead is not without obstacles. Disagreements exist within Parliament, within the Prime Minister's party, between Holyrood and Westminster, and among the public regarding what form the UK's future outside of the EU should take. There is a two-year window to resolve these issues. Despite being initially in favor of remaining in the EU, Prime Minister May has emerged as a crucial figure in the Tory Party. She is often referred to as the \\"last grown-up left standing\\" following bitter conflicts within the Party after the referendum. However, there are concerns within Westminster about the government's ability to manage the complexities that lie ahead. Doubts exist about the Party's internal unity, the opposition's capacity to provide intense scrutiny during this crucial decision-making period, and overall, whether Prime Minister May's goals for the negotiation outcomes are even feasible. The results of these negotiations will indubitably shape the political and national future of both May and the UK itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

First question: Is death by carbon monoxide painful? Why or why not? Second question: What cars put out higher levels of carbon monoxide? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First answer: Carbon monoxide is a gas that we can't see, smell, or taste. When people breathe it in, it takes the place of the oxygen our bodies need. This can make us feel dizzy, sleepy, or give us a headache. If a person breathes in too much carbon monoxide, they might fall asleep and not wake up. It's not like a boo-boo that hurts, but it's still dangerous because it doesn't let our bodies work properly. Second answer: Some cars make more carbon monoxide than others, especially older cars that don't work as well or don't have special parts called \\"catalytic converters\\" to help clean the air coming out of the car. Bigger cars with larger engines might also make more carbon monoxide because they need more fuel to go. It's important to take care of our cars and follow rules to help keep the air clean for everyone. These two questions are not the same thing.

Wallace, eager to prove his mettle, eagerly embarks on the mission, recruiting a team of dedicated officers, including the talented but inexperienced Officer Sarah Baker. As the task force delves deeper into the criminal underworld, they begin to unravel the complex web of corruption that De Luca has built around himself. Sarah also discovers that fugitive drug lord, Eduardo Sanchez, is in a secret partnership with De Luca. This alliance, however, is something that not even Wallace was aware of, and it raises the stakes for the task force. Act 3: As Wallace's team closes in on De Luca, a new twist emerges. The Sentinel division receives anonymous tips linking Wallace to illegal activities and bribery connected to De Luca's organization. The Chief of Police immediately suspends Wallace and begins a covert investigation, assigning Sarah to head the case against her mentor. Overwhelmed by a mix of loyalty and pursuit of justice, Sarah is torn. However, she's determined to find the truth. As she investigates, Sarah uncovers evidence pointing to a potential setup by De Luca and Sanchez to set Wallace up as the fall guy, eliminating the primary threat against their operations. Act 4: Wallace, feeling betrayed by his own unit, decides to take matters into his own hands. He contacts Jessica, his ex-wife, to help him find the truth. Jessica, a former investigative journalist facing her own struggles, reluctantly agrees to help. Unbeknownst to them, the corruption goes higher up than they ever imagined. The Chief of Police is secretly in league with De Luca and Sanchez – setting up Wallace is part of a larger plan aimed at controlling the city's law enforcement. Act 5: Working together, Wallace and Jessica expose the sinister connections in an effort to clear Wallace's name and save the city from the control of De Luca and Sanchez. Sarah confronts the Chief of Police, who tries to frame her as well, but ultimately fails. In a climactic finale, Wallace and the task force raid De Luca's hideout, leading to a deadly confrontation between Wallace, De Luca, and Sanchez. The Chief of Police is arrested as the truth is revealed. As the dust settles, Wallace receives recognition for his bravery. He receives an honourable discharge, but decides to retire from police work to rekindle his relationship with Jessica and Emily. Sarah, inspired by Wallace's dedication, continues with her fight against crime and corruption as the city's new guardian."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Short movie review: of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This brief review of the movie \\"The Pool\\" seems to reflect a rather negative outlook on the film, predominantly due to their dissatisfaction with the conclusion. While the reviewer did not provide any details about the themes, storytelling, characters, or overall production of the film, they particularly berate the ending, calling it \\"utterly incompetent.\\" This phrase indicates considerable dissatisfaction, as it strongly criticizes the movie's resolution for being inept, unfit, or unable to achieve the intentions or expectations set up by the rest of the film. The word \\"utterly\\" amplifies this negativity, suggesting it was not only inadequate but overwhelmingly so. It's important to note that despite this negative comment, we can't fully comprehend the reviewer's overall take on the film, as they did not provide details on other aspects of the movie that could have been satisfactory. Aspects such as cinematography, film editing, sound design, character development, acting performances, among others, can significantly influence the general perception of a movie, in addition to the conclusion. However, taking the critique for its face value, it's safe to say that this critic had significant negative impressions towards the movie's ending, which would likely color their perspective of the film as a whole negatively. This short review, therefore, gives us an impression that the critic did not respond positively to 'The Pool', specifically its conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: In a rematch of their only loss so far this season, the Patriots faced the Buffalo Bills in a road game. After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal. Heading into their bye week, the Patriots improved to 7-1, the best record in the league.","completion":"How did the Patriots' defense contribute to their win against the Buffalo Bills, and how did Tom Brady's performance with four touchdown passes to different receivers impact the final score of 41-25 in favor of the Patriots?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. and the situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Answer the following question: In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Answer:","completion":"In Kenya, plant roots would play a greater role in soil development as compared to Tanzania. This is because, in the grasslands of Kenya, a significant portion of the organic matter that contributes to soil development comes from the deep, fibrous root systems of grasses. These root systems extend far into the soil, contributing to the overall structure and fertility of the soil by breaking up compacted soil layers and creating pathways for water and nutrients to reach deeper levels. In contrast, in the Tanzanian forests, the principal source of soil organic matter is fallen tree leaves on the forest floor. Although tree roots also contribute to soil development, their impact is comparatively less compared to the extensive grass root systems in grasslands. Furthermore, the Kenyan grasslands experience frequent fires, which destroy aboveground plant material but actually stimulate even greater contributions from roots. The increased root growth following fires helps in the development of a thicker A horizon (topsoil layer) with a deeper distribution of organic matter. In Tanzanian forests, the soil organic matter is mostly stored in the O horizon (forest floor layer) and a thinner A horizon due to the greater acidity, which inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that would otherwise mix surface litter into the mineral soil. In summary, plant roots, specifically those of grasses, play a greater role in soil development in Kenya than in Tanzania due to the grassland ecosystem and the impact of fires stimulating root growth and soil organic matter distribution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They describe different responsibilities and roles of the ninth and tenth Baronets, suggesting different contexts or times, which significantly changes the content and meaning conveyed by each. To give a detailed understanding, let's break each sentence down: In Sentence 1, \\"The tenth Baronet was Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire, and the ninth Baronet served as Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire and Clwyd.\\" Here, the tenth Baronet is described as being the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire alone while the ninth Baronet served as the Lord Lieutenant not just of Denbighshire but also of Clwyd. Conversely, Sentence 2 states \\"The ninth Baronet was Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire, and the tenth Baronet served as Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire and Clwyd.\\" In this sentence, the story is flipped. The ninth Baronet is stated to be the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire alone, while the tenth Baronet is reported to have been the Lord Lieutenant of both, Denbighshire and Clwyd. The roles of the ninth and tenth Baronets have been swapped between sentences. Thus, the functions, years, or periods in question for the ninth and tenth Baronets must also be different.

PUBLISHED:. 10:33 EST, 3 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:14 EST, 3 December 2013. A woman whose family was wiped out in a car crash said 'I lost my everybody' in the collision. Elber Twomey was the only survivor after the crash which took the lives of her husband, their son and their unborn child. The suicidal driver of the other vehicle was also killed. 'I lost my everbody': Elber Twomey criticises the police who she blames for causing the crash which killed her husband, her son and her unborn child in Torquay, Devon. Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was 24 weeks pregnant at the time, said her family would still be alive if police hadn’t pursued the car of 26-year-old Marek Wojiechowski. Emergency services were contacted after he left his wife a suicide note, and when his car was spotted, an officer gave chase, switching on his flashing lights and siren. Wojiechowski then ‘deliberately’ drove straight into the Twomeys family’s VW Golf during their holiday in Torquay, Devon. Oisin Twomey, who was 16 months old, died at the scene. Crash scene: A father, a son and his wife's unborn child all died following this crash in Torquay, Devon, in July last year. Marek Wojiechowski deliberately crashed his vehicle into the Twomey family's VW Golf. Grief: Elber Twomey with her husband Con on their wedding day. He died 10 months after a crash which killed their toddler son. His father Con, 39, died later ten months later in hospital after suffering serious brain injuries. Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was hospitalised for months and lost her unborn daughter, spoke after the inquest of her son and the Polish taxi-driver. She believes that police driver’s approach was ‘completely wrong’ and caused Wojiechowski to panic. Speaking on the last day of the inquest in Torquay, she said of the day of the crash in July 2012: ‘I lost my everybody. ‘Up to 2.46pm on July 6th I had not a care in the world. ‘I was on holiday with my darling husband and best friend Con, our beautiful little man, baba Oisin and our beautiful unborn daughter. At 2.47pm our wonderful life ended.’ She continued:’I will always be of the opinion that the manner in which the police dealt with Marek that horrific day was completely wrong. ‘I believe that a more cautious and considered response by the police is necessary to protect lives. The lack of this caution has cost me my entire family.’ She continued: ‘I believe it was a misjudgement by the police officer involved to request Marek to stop. ‘He was not driving erratically, he did not have his wife and children with him and he had not indicated that he would end his life by using his car. ‘While I don’t blame the police officer involved personally for my tragic story, I do blame the police service.’ The inquest heard that Wojiechowski had agreed to split with his wife Agnieszka and left a four-page suicide note. Accident victim: Oisin Twomey, aged 16 months, who died at the scene following the crash in Torquay, Devon, last year. She raised the alarm when she found the letter and CCTV cameras recorded him circling a roundabout and driving in a continuous two-mile loop. Police response driver PC Ben Bickford spotted a black car driving in the opposite carriageway and followed to see if it was Wojiechowski. Suicidal: Marek Wojciechowski who caused the crash which wiped out a young family. He drove between 70 and 80 mph to catch up and flashed his lights to signal the driver to pull over. PC Bickford told a previous hearing of the inquest: ‘When I saw that he wasn’t going to stop I pulled back. I am not a trained pursuit driver. The driver was aware of my presence. ‘As we approached the single carriageway he made a deliberate act of accelerating and driving straight into the other carriageway.’ Wojiechowski, a former chef, was arrested at the scene but died from his injuries later that day in hospital. Mr Twomey was transported back to a hospital near his native Cork in Ireland but died in May this year. In a narrative verdict, a. jury of 10 said that both Oisin and Wojiechowski died because the. Pole had ‘suddenly steered his car across the road into the opposite. carriageway and accelerated into oncoming traffic in an attempt to. commit suicide.’ Coroner. for Plymouth, Torbay and South Devon, Ian Arrow said the police officer. involved did all he could but he planned to write to the Association of. Chief Police Officers to ask for a review. He. said: ‘Particular review should be given to how police officers should. approach and deal with distressed or vulnerable individuals. It may. require further with health care professionals.’ Chief Superintendent and head of operations for Devon and Cornwall Police, Jim Nye, said after the inquest that the police officer acted appropriately and in line with national guidelines. Mrs Twomey said she rejected the findings of an IPCC report that said ‘no learning outcomes or organisational learning was identified’ from the tragedy. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Nuclear Assault is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed after bassist Dan Lilker left Anthrax in 1984. After releasing five full-length albums and touring relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Nuclear Assault split up in 1995. They briefly reunited in 1997 and again in 2002, and are still active today. - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk. - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

Brazil routed Japan in Singapore thanks to a quite magnificent individual performance from star striker and captain Neymar. The forward bagged all four of their goals - including a perfect hat-trick - in a 4-0 victory and he was brilliant throughout. For his first goal, Brazil's favourite son rounded the goalkeeper and slotted home, and then coolly passed one into the back of the net and completed his hat-trick with a rebound before heading in his fourth and final strike with just nine minutes remaining. Host commentator A lovely left-footed outside-of-the-foot pass through the middle splits open the","completion":"Japan defense line. Neymar runs onto the ball, brilliantly controlling it with the outside of his right foot. Japan's goalkeeper, trying to narrow the angle, comes running off his line, but the Brazilian starlet is too quick and composed for him. He gently touches the ball past the advancing keeper with his left foot and then rounds him with ease. With the goal at his mercy and Japanese defenders desperately trying to rush back, Neymar keeps his cool and effortlessly slots the ball into the empty net. The Singapore crowd erupts in applause, appreciating the genius of the Brazilian maestro. That’s Neymar's first goal. For his second goal, Neymar showcases amazing vision and composure. After some brilliant build-up play by Brazil, the ball comes to Neymar who is positioned about 20 yards from the goal. He takes one look at the goal, and instead of power, he opts for accuracy. He passes the ball as if he were a pool player choosing a precise angle and the ball finds its way into the bottom right of the net, leaving the keeper flatfooted. His coolness under immense pressure is absolutely awe-inspiring. That's his second goal. For the third goal, Neymar once again displays his striker's instincts as he pounces on a rebound. With a powerful shot from outside the box, the Japanese goalkeeper manages to parry away the initial effort. But the ball ricochets straight to Neymar, who puts his foot through it from close range and completes his hat trick. His anticipation and opportunistic effort perfectly manifest his brilliance. Finally, the fourth goal comes from a header. As the Brazil midfielder swings in a perfect cross from the right flank, Neymar positions himself well among the Japanese defenders. He makes a well-timed leap, meets the ball with precision and his header finds the bottom corner of the goal. The ball nestles in the net and completes Neymar's magnificent virtuoso display. Relentless from start to finish, Neymar demonstrates why he's been so highly rated. His exuberance, commitment, and sheer soccer brilliance lights the game up, as he leads Brazil to an emphatic 4-0 victory over Japan. His sensational performance perfectly demonstrates how one player can single-handedly lead the team to victory, making this match a perfect display of Neymar in his prime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece. John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't. Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film. Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same. Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the \\"clown\\" mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times! Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. Which friend didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase? Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Answer:","completion":"Andy is the friend who didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. Let's delve a bit deeper into this. HMG-CoA reductase is an enzyme which plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of cholesterol in our bodies. In individuals with high cholesterol, the inhibition of this enzyme can play a crucial role in reducing cholesterol levels. Drugs that achieve this are called statins. Statins are a commonly prescribed medication to treat high cholesterol. They work by blocking the action of the liver enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, thereby reducing the production of cholesterol. When less cholesterol is produced, the level of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or 'bad' cholesterol is reduced, which in turn reduces the risk of developing heart diseases which are associated with high cholesterol levels. In the story you've provided, though both friends have high levels of cholesterol, only Ben sought medical help and was consequently prescribed cholesterol medication - likely in the form of a statin given the common use of these drugs. As such, he would be the one who took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. On the other hand, Andy, due to his carelessness, did not go to the doctor and therefore did not receive any such medication. Hence, he did not take a drug that would alter his HMG-CoA reductase levels. It's also worth noting that while statins are often effective, they function differently depending on individual genetic makeups due to the field of pharmacogenomics. This branch of knowledge explores the impact of individual genetic variations on drug response, which is why statins might considerably lower cholesterol in some people, have a moderate effect in others, or not be significantly effective in certain individuals. However, thanks to the diverse range of statins available, doctors can generally find an effective medication or combination for each individual. Therefore, it is crucial to seek medical advice when dealing with high cholesterol, like Ben did, rather than ignoring the problem as Andy has."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rajat Gupta, 63, denied illegally leaking boardroom secrets to Raj Rajaratnam, a former hedge fund manager now serving 11 years in prison. The jury acquitted Gupta, a former managing partner of consulting giant McKinsey & Co, of two other charges. Gupta could face up to 20 years in jail when he is sentenced on 18 October. Prosecutors said that, in secret recordings of conversations with Rajaratnam, Gupta shared corporate secrets as though \\"he was talking about what happened at a Yankee game yesterday\\". But defence lawyers told the jury that the use of phone records and FBI wiretaps only created the illusion of illegal business activities. \\"That is a gambit that can bamboozle people into thinking something was proven when it wasn't,\\" defence lawyer Gary Naftalis said. The trial focused on a phone call made to Rajaratnam on 23 September 2008, minutes after Gupta had listened to a private conference call discussing a 5bn (Â£3.2bn) investment in Goldman Sachs by Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway. The deal would be made public after stock markets closed that day. According to phone records, Rajaratnam bought 40m in Goldman Sachs stock moments after the phone call, earning nearly 1m. Gupta, who was born in India and educated at Harvard, becomes the most prominent corporate figure to be convicted in a sweeping probe into insider trading.

The key piece of evidence was a covertly recorded phone call made to Rajaratnam, following a private conference regarding Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway investing 5 billion dollars into Goldman Sachs. Directly after the call, Rajaratnam purchased a substantial amount of Goldman Sachs stock and made a large profit. Though Gupta's defense argued that the evidence merely created an illusion of illicit activity, the conviction holds meaningful implications concerning insider trading.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go through the steps in the fossilization process and consider the potential effects of the perturbation (more clean clear air) on each step. 1. An organism dies: The death of an organism is not directly affected by the increased presence of clean clear air. 2. Water seeps into the remains: Clean clear air might indirectly influence this step. With cleaner air, the environmental conditions may change slightly, potentially affecting water sources, precipitation, and patterns. However, this would be an indirect effect, and the process of water seeping into remains would not fundamentally change. 3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: Clean clear air does not directly impact the minerals dissolved in water forming crystals. The chemical process of minerals being deposited in the remains and forming crystals is not affected by the air composition. 4. Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden: Similarly, the hardening of the remains due to crystalized minerals is a chemical process not directly affected by the presence of clean clear air. The perturbation does not play a role in this step of the process. 5. The minerals form a fossil: Ultimately, the formation of a fossil is not directly influenced by the presence of clean clear air. Indirectly, the perturbation might slightly affect water and environmental conditions, but it would not significantly alter the process of fossil formation. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more clean clear air does not have a direct effect on the fossil formation process.

Write an article using the following points: Defense attorneys are expected to present oral arguments Tuesday. Edgar Tamayo Arias is scheduled to be executed in Texas on Wednesday. Mexico's government says the execution would violate international law. Tamayo was convicted in the 1994 killing of a Houston police officer. Article:","completion":"Title: Execution of Edgar Tamayo Arias: A Controversial Case Involving International Law Introduction: On Tuesday, defense attorneys are expected to present oral arguments in a last-ditch effort to halt the execution of Edgar Tamayo Arias. Arias, who is scheduled to be executed in Texas on Wednesday, was convicted for the 1994 killing of a Houston police officer. The impending execution has garnered international attention, as Mexico's government claims that it would violate international law. Step 1: Presenting defense attorneys' oral arguments Defense attorneys, making their case on Tuesday, are likely to emphasize the international law aspect of the case and argue that executing Tamayo would infringe upon his rights as a foreign national. Additionally, the defense may bring up any issues related to the legal process in the United States, such as potential violations of due process and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Step 2: Discussing Edgar Tamayo Arias's scheduled execution If the defense's arguments are not successful in court, Tamayo Arias faces execution on Wednesday, following the standard legal processes in Texas. His execution could lead to strained relations between the United States and Mexico, as Mexico's government has expressed their opposition to the execution on the grounds that it violates international law. Step 3: Explaining Mexico's government stance on the issue Mexico's government has taken a strong stand against the execution, arguing that it would violate international law, specifically the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR). Under VCCR, foreign nationals who are arrested or detained are entitled to contact their consulate for assistance. In Tamayo's case, the Mexican government asserts that he was never informed of his consular rights, which could have significantly impacted his trial and sentencing. Step 4: Addressing potential repercussions of execution If the execution proceeds as scheduled, it may have serious implications not only for U.S.-Mexico relations, but also for other foreign nationals facing criminal proceedings in the United States. The United States has a responsibility to comply with international treaties, and the execution of Tamayo Arias, under these circumstances, could undermine that commitment. Conclusion: The case of Edgar Tamayo Arias highlights the intricate intersection of domestic criminal proceedings and international law. With the defense attorneys set to present their oral arguments on Tuesday, the future of Arias remains uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, this case serves as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance in ensuring that the rights of foreign nationals are upheld in the United States and that international obligations are respected."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

General Webster(Riccardo Montalban is a close second)...my question would be how did he ever get to be a 3-star general...the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, it's a wonder they show him any respect at all.

One fateful morning, Mukesh wakes up with a start, drenched in sweat after a particularly vivid nightmare. As he tries to recover from the dream, he is startled to find Om standing at his bedside. Om begins to taunt Mukesh, revealing details about his past that Mukesh thought long-buried. Unable to escape the clutches of his tormentor, Mukesh delves into the dark secrets of his youth. Once a juvenile delinquent caught up in the city's underworld, he had made a desperate bargain with Om to rise above his circumstances. With each new revelation, Mukesh realizes that Om played a significant role in his meteoric rise to success. However, Om is now back to collect his dues, threatening to bring Mukesh's world crashing down. Determined to protect his family and his reputation, Mukesh gathers his resources and strength to combat the dangerous Om. As they engage in an action-packed game of cat and mouse, both Mukesh's past and Om's true intentions are slowly unraveled. Throughout the rollercoaster of emotions and suspense, Mukesh ultimately learns the truth about Om - that Om is the manifestation of his guilt, created by his subconscious. Om had been haunting Mukesh's dreams and memories because Mukesh had not fully confronted his past. To confront Om, Mukesh must face his own fears and regrets by taking responsibility for his past actions. The journey leads him through the gritty underworld of Mumbai, where he attempts to atone for past wrongs by helping those who, like his younger self, have fallen prey to crime and desperation. The thrilling climax unfolds as Mukesh battles Om in a dramatic showdown, symbolically overcoming his past and moving forward towards redemption. In the end, Mukesh's life is forever changed, and he emerges from the experience a wiser, stronger, and more compassionate man. The Reckoning of Mukesh serves as a stirring reminder of the power of forgiveness, redemption, and self-discovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What newspaper does Ellsworth Toohey write for? Movie title: The Fountainhead Movie plot: Howard Roark (Gary Cooper) has just left university. He is told off by the dean (Paul Stanton), as he does not want to know anything about history or how buildings were built in the past; he is only interested in the modern possibilities of building. That forces the dean to take the matter on his own hands and expel him. But Roark has already decided that he wants to work for only one person: Henry Cameron (Henry Hull). Even Peter Keating (Ken Smith), his fellow student and good friend, advises him not to follow that career path, as Cameron was a renown architect thirty years before, but these days he is a finished man. Howard does not listen. He is admitted by Cameron because of the project he has designed, although Cameron himself tells him that he will be finished like him in a few years. Cameron recognises Roark's talents and hires him.Some years later, Cameron is making a scene of himself at the train station. He's drunk and buying copies of the yellow-press newspaper The Banner just to tear its pages away. The newsboy (Bob Alden) does not know what to do about it. A police officer (Paul Newlan) appears and is about to arrest him. Roark kindly takes him to their office. Cameron is a broken man: back at the office, he picks up a t-square and thrusts it into a window pane; then, he has a fit and passes out on the floor. Roark goes with him to hospital in an ambulance. There, Cameron knows he's about to die, and he makes Roark promise that he will burn every document Cameron has. Also, Cameron advises Roark to compromise, or he will end up like Cameron.A year and a half later, Roark is still burning documents from late Cameron.

The iconic Swanson Speed Square has been an important construction tool since 1925 when it was invented by Albert J. Swanson. Since then the name \\"speed square\\" has become a generic term, but every speed square is not a Swanson, just as every facial tissue is not Kleenex. Swanson is still the best. I purchased the 7\\" Swanson to use along with my trusted 12\\" model. It comes with a little instruction manual, which can be used to find all the uses for a speed square. But personally, I've made peace with the idea that my Swanson Speed Square is simply smarter than me. Is the review positive or negative?

Given the following context: Recording sessions for the album began on October 31, 1988, at Downtown Recorders in Boston, Massachusetts, at the time a professional 24-track studio. 4AD allowed the Pixies a budget of 40,000, excluding producer's fees. This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including gated reverb to the mix. The master tapes were then sent for final post-production later that month. answer the following question: What is the full name of the artist who's greatest hits album did the lead singer of the band that tried to \\"remain somewhat grungy\\" give to the man that added layers of guitars to songs?","completion":"The full name of the artist is Charles Hardin Holley, better known as Buddy Holly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: A Fistful of Dollars Context: A Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood), arrives at a little Mexican border town named San Miguel. He is quickly introduced to the feud between two families vying to gain control of the town: the Rojo brothers, consisting of Don Miguel (Antonio Prieto) (the eldest and nominally in charge), Esteban (Sieghardt Rupp) (the most headstrong) and Ramón (the most capable and intelligent, played by Gian Maria Volontè, who would reappear in For a Few Dollars More as the psychopathic El Indio), and the family of so-called \\"town sheriff\\" John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy).The Stranger quickly spies an opportunity to make a \\"fistful of dollars\\" and decides to play both families against each other. His opportunity comes when a detachment of Mexican soldiers escorting a shipment of gold passes through the town. The gold is ostensibly being delivered to a troop of American soldiers at the border river in exchange for a shipment of modern American weapons, but upon following the Mexican troops, the Stranger watches from hiding as they are massacred by members of the Rojo gang, disguised in American uniforms and led by Ramon Rojo.The Stranger takes two of the bodies to a nearby cemetery and sells information to both sides that two soldiers survived the attack. Both sides race to the cemetery, the Baxters to get the \\"survivors\\" to testify against the Rojos, and the Rojos to silence them.

Placing the legs of the picnic table in buckets holding water will allow you to eat peacefully without ants crawling up onto the table top. Also sprinkle the area with cinnamon or cayenne pepper as a no fuss deterrent. Option (I) is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because placing the legs of the picnic table in buckets of water creates a physical barrier that ants cannot cross. Ants are generally not good at swimming or crossing water, so this method effectively deters them. On the other hand, Option (II) suggests placing the table legs on sheets of paper, which does not create an effective barrier for ants. They can easily walk over or crawl under the paper.

Choose from: - indifferent. - proud. - bored. Answer:","completion":"Based on the situation you presented, Jesse would best be described as proud. Jesse is clearly an individual who takes pride in his actions, particularly in those that contribute positively to the welfare and safety of others. Seeing the robbers and making the decision to inform Robin's parents shows his proactive nature and willingness to involve himself in difficult situations for the good of others. When defining someone as proud, it's essential to note that it doesn't only imply personal pride over achievements but can also signify taking pride in contributing to the community and doing what's morally and ethically right. Jesse’s actions demonstrate his moral compass, which guides his choices and behaviors. The act of telling Robin's parents about the robbers, even though it may involve certain risks, indicates a significant level of courage and determination to do what is right, a typical attribute of a proud individual. His pride is not in achieving personal gain but in knowing he's made a valuable contribution to someone else's safety and peace of mind. There's no evidence of Jesse being indifferent or bored. Indifference suggests a lack of interest or concern, which is certainly not the case here; Jesse was proactive and engaged in the situation. Boredom implies a lack of stimulation or interest in one's surroundings or circumstances, whereas Jesse clearly demonstrated alertness, vigilance, and a keen understanding of the gravity of the situation. Therefore, suggesting that Jesse is proud characterizes him accurately as someone who prioritizes righteousness over personal inconvenience, takes pride in his values and ethical standards, and willingly takes action when needed. He demonstrates an admirable level of maturity and moral integrity, making 'proud' the most fitting description out of the options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and the Indus Valley Civilization in Ancient India (modern-day Pakistan and some parts of India). Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What machinery has lead to the easily made and widespread use of cotton?","completion":"The machinery that has led to the easily made and widespread use of cotton is the cotton gin. Invented by Eli Whitney in 1794, the cotton gin revolutionized the cotton industry by making the process of separating the cotton fibers from their seeds drastically quicker and easier. Before the invention of the cotton gin, cotton processing was an incredibly labor-intensive task that required many hours and a significant amount of manual work. Workers had to pick the cotton from the plants in the field, and then each individual seed had to be painstakingly separated from the cotton fibers by hand. Each cotton boll contains numerous seeds, each surrounded by the cotton fiber, making this task quite arduous and time-consuming. The cotton gin mechanized this process. The machine works by pulling the cotton through a series of wire teeth that remove the seeds from the fibers. The seeds fall through a slot in the bottom of the machine, allowing the fibers to be pulled through and wound onto a spindle. This mechanization greatly improved the efficiency of cotton processing, allowing it to be done on a much larger scale and at a much faster pace. Even though there were initial issues around the patent for the cotton gin, with numerous legal contests over who held the true rights to the invention, Eli Whitney’s machine had an enormous impact on the cotton industry. It reduced the cost of cotton production and made it affordable for more people. This led to a boom in the cotton industry, particularly in the southern United States where cotton was a major crop. As a result, cotton became more widely available and was used more extensively in textile manufacturing, leading to its predominance in the market. Moreover, the invention of the cotton gin led to further industrialization in the textile industry. Innovations such as the spinning jenny, the power loom, and the spinning mule came after the cotton gin and further mechanized the process of turning cotton into cloth. They allowed textiles to be produced much more quickly and cheaply, making them more accessible to a greater number of people and further promoting the widespread use of cotton. In sum, the invention of the cotton gin was instrumental in the widespread use of cotton as it made the processing of cotton far more efficient, drastically reducing the cost of production and enabling the mass production of cotton textiles. This crucial piece of machinery, along with later developments in textile machinery, revolutionized the textile industry and led to the dominance of cotton in the global textile market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are a few reasons for this interpretation: 1. The use of \\"thin\\" typically refers to something lacking substance, depth, or value. In this context, it seems to imply that the content in question might not be engaging, captivating, or able to maintain the audience's interest over the specified running time. 2. The term \\"stretched\\" also carries a negative connotation, as it suggests that the material is being extended or dragged out over the 80-minute running time. When something is stretched out, it can become tiresome or boring to the audience, as the original substance could lose its impact and be unable to sustain the prolonged exposure. 3. The phrase \\"nearly 80-minute running time\\" might be interpreted as excessive or unnecessarily long, which can contribute to the overall negative tone of the statement. Depending on the context, having an extended running time could be a negative factor, as it might take more time and effort to maintain the audience's engagement and interest. 4.

Background: Sherman Joseph Alexie, Jr. (born October 7, 1966) is a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist, short story writer, poet, and filmmaker. His writings draw on his experiences as an Indigenous American with ancestry from several tribes. He grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and now lives in Seattle, Washington. His best-known book is The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (1993), a collection of short stories. Context: Alexie was born on October 7, 1966, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, Washington. As a little child he lived on the Spokane Indian Reservation, located west of Spokane. His father, Sherman Joseph Alexie, was a member of the Coeur d'Alene tribe, and his mother, Lillian Agnes Cox, was of Colville, Choctaw, Spokane and European American ancestry. One of his paternal great-grandfathers was of Russian descent. Alexie was born with hydrocephalus, a condition that occurs when there is an abnormally large amount of cerebral fluid in the cranial cavity. He had to have brain surgery when he was six months old, and was at high risk of death or mental disabilities if he survived. Alexie's surgery was successful; he suffered no mental damage but had other side effects. His parents were alcoholics though his mother was a sober alcoholic. His father often left the house on drinking binges for days at a time. To support her six children, Alexie's mother, Lillian, sewed quilts, worked as a clerk at the Wellpinit Trading Post and had some other jobs. Alexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging because he was constantly teased by other kids as well as endured abuse he described as \\"torture\\" from teachers who were white nuns. They called him \\"The Globe\\" because his head was larger than usual, due to the hydrocephalus as an infant. Until the age of seven, Alexie suffered from seizures and bedwetting; he had to take strong drugs to control them. Because of his health problems, he was excluded from many of the activities that are rites of passage for young Indian males. Alexie excelled academically, reading everything available, including auto repair manuals. Question: Why was life at the reservation challenging to him?.

She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). Context: In her Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics at age 17, Vonn raced in both slalom and combined in Salt Lake City, with her best result coming with sixth in combined. On March 4, 2003, she earned a silver medal in downhill in the Junior World Championship at Puy Saint-Vincent, France. Vonn credits a change in her attitude toward training to a bike ride with fellow ski racer Julia Mancuso and Mancuso's father Ciro when Vonn visited them at their home in Lake Tahoe, California. With little biking experience, she quickly found herself miles behind Julia and Ciro. Alone and embarrassed, she realized she needed drastic revision of her training regimen and her attitude toward training if she was going to be successful. On March 24, 2004, Vonn was the downhill silver medalist at the U.S. Alpine Championships at Mt. Alyeska Resort, Girdwood, Alaska. Earlier that year 2004, Vonn climbed onto the World Cup podium for the first time with a third-place finish in downhill in January 2004 at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Her maiden victory in that specialty came at Lake Louise, Alberta, in December 2004. She captured five more World Cup podiums over the next two months. In 2005, she competed in four races at her first World Championships held in Bormio, Italy, pulling in fourth-place finishes in both the downhill and the combined.

Here's the equation: -24*k - 92*k - 34*k = 80*k - 10350 First, let's add the 'k' parts together on both sides of the equal sign. On the left side, you have: (-24 - 92 - 34) * k When you do the math, it's: -150 * k Now, the equation looks like this: -150*k = 80*k - 10350 Next, let's move all the 'k' parts to one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 150*k to both sides: (-150*k) + 150*k = 80*k - 10350 + 150*k This simplifies to: 0 = 230*k - 10350 Now, we want to get rid of the 230 in 230*k. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 230: 230*k ÷ 230 = 10350 ÷ 230 This simplifies to: k = 45 So, the value of 'k' is 45."},{"prompt":"Q: Sasha was really upset and needed some cheering up.

Background: Stanley Donen ( DAWN-@n; born April 13, 1924) is an American film director and choreographer whose most celebrated works are Singin' in the Rain and On the Town, both of which he co-directed with actor and dancer Gene Kelly. Other noteworthy films include Royal Wedding, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face, Indiscreet, Damn Yankees!, Charade, and Two for the Road. He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. Context: Stanley Donen was born in Columbia, South Carolina to Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, and Helen (Cohen), the daughter of a jewelry salesman. His younger sister Carla Donen Davis was born in August 1937. Although born to Jewish parents, he became an atheist in his youth. Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy as one of the few Jews in Columbia, and he was occasionally bullied by anti-semitic classmates at school. To help cope with his isolation, he spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical Flying Down to Rio. Donen said that he \\"must have seen the picture thirty or forty times. I was transported into some sort of fantasy world where everything seemed to be happy, comfortable, easy and supported. A sense of well-being filled me.\\" He shot and screened home movies with an 8 mm camera and projector that his father bought for him. Inspired by Astaire, Donen took dance lessons in Columbia and performed at the local Town Theater. His family often traveled to New York City during summer vacations where he saw Broadway musicals and took further dance lessons. One of his early instructors in New York was Ned Wayburn, who had taught eleven-year-old Astaire in 1910. After graduating from high school at sixteen, Donen attended the University of South Carolina for one summer semester, studying psychology. Encouraged by his mother, he moved to New York City to pursue dancing on stage in the fall of 1940. After two auditions he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, directed by the legendary George Abbott. The titular Pal Joey was played by the young up-and-comer Gene Kelly, who became a Broadway star in the role. Abbott cast Donen in the chorus of his next Broadway show Best Foot Forward. He became the show's assistant stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer. Eventually Donen was fired from Best Foot Forward, but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott's next show Beat the Band. In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for Call Me Mister. Question: Who was his mother ?

It is one of outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg's final health initiatives, which the New York City Department of Health proposed to the Board of Health in September. \\"Young children have a high risk of developing severe complications from influenza,\\" the Health Department said in a statement. \\"One-third of children under five in New York City do not receive an annual influenza vaccination, even though the vaccine safely and effectively protects them against influenza illness. Young children often pass influenza to other children and family members, who then spread the infection to others in the community.\\" The flu vaccine will be added to the seven other vaccines children under 5 are required to get, including measles, whooping cough and chicken pox. \\"We know that influenza is a serious illness which affects an estimated 15% to 40% of children during annual flu season,\\" said Dr. Jay Varma, who oversees infectious diseases as deputy commissioner of the New York City Health Department. Richard Kanowitz, president of Families Fighting Flu, lost his daughter at age 4 to the virus. \\"This is great news for children,\\" he said. \\"Had the same law been in effect when my daughter was alive in 2004, she'd be alive today. She would not have gotten the flu.\\" \\"Only 60 percent of children under the age of 5 in New York City get vaccinated,\\" Dr. Varma said. \\"In New Jersey and Connecticut, where they have this requirement, it's 80%.\\" The issue of vaccinating children is controversial. One consistent claim is that vaccines can cause autism. \\"This was a very closed process,\\" said John Gilmore, director of the Manhattan-based Autism Action Network. \\"We will most likely be filing a lawsuit fairly soon to overturn this. From a legal standpoint, we see this as similar to the soda ban,\\" referring to the mayor's unsuccessful attempt to ban sugary drinks. Varma said the myths that flu shots can cause the flu, or worse, are just that, myths. \\"It does not cause you to get the flu; it does not cause you to get autism,\\" he said. The flu vaccine is available in two forms -- shot or nasal spray -- and children are required to get vaccinated by December 31. \\"To the extent that this saves lives, it's great news,\\" Kranowitz said. \\"I wish my daughter had had the vaccination because, I, as well as other parents, were unaware how the flu killed healthy children.

Context: The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed. Answer:","completion":"It is beneficial to limit main memory usage because accessing main memory is often slow compared to the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and control units. By utilizing the special memory cells called registers, which can be read and written to much more rapidly, the computer can avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed, thus greatly increasing its speed. Since registers are used for the most frequently needed data items, limiting main memory usage makes the overall processing more efficient, leading to faster performance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We want to find the value of z in this equation: 0 = 49z - 407z + 5728 First, let's combine the terms with z.

So, let's move the -358 with z to the other side by adding 358z to both sides: 358z = 5728 We're almost there! Now, to find the value of z, we need to divide both sides by 358: z = 5728 ÷ 358 When we do the division, we get: z = 16 So, the solution to the problem is z = 16.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Ex-Mizzou recruit Tony Mitchell ready to comeback at North Texas Though Tony Mitchell still looked like a raw prospect in Latvia, he could develop into a first-round pick. Two recruits from the Rivals.com Class of 2010 top 20 never appeared in a game last season. The first, everyone knows. The NCAA deemed him a professional due to benefits he received from a professional club in Turkey, and Kentucky's Internet fan-army started a T-shirt campaign to \\"free\\" him from the collegiate ban. Ultimately all he did was serve as a student assistant coach and train in Lexington. He still managed to be picked No. 3 overall in last month's NBA draft. Things worked out well for Enes Kanter. The second missing prospect was sitting in hotel lobby in Riga, Latvia, earlier this month, wearing USA warmup gear, explaining where he's been playing basketball for the past year: on his own in gyms around Dallas, or in rec-center pickup games on the campus of North Texas. \\"This whole wait has been tough,\\" he said. \\"I felt real rusty when I showed up [in Latvia], but I'm starting to get back in the groove.\\" As he spoke, the Serbian, Croatian and Lithuanian national teams were filing by him on their way to the lunch buffet. Those players -- his opponents in the FIBA U19 World Championships, in which the U.S. finished fifth -- have been his only meaningful competition since he played with the Americans in last summer's qualifying tournament in San Antonio. He had signed a letter of intent with Missouri, but was never allowed on campus, and then resurfaced at North Texas. The question this July remains the same as it was last July: Will things work out for Tony Mitchell? Mitchell's case received far less media attention than did Kanter's, in part because Mitchell wasn't at Kentucky, and in part because his issues involved academics, not compensation. The 6-8 power forward was, at No. 12 overall in Rivals' rankings, the highest-rated player ever to sign with Mizzou, but his high school transcripts drew major red flags from the NCAA. In his junior year, as part of a quest to better his grades to be come eligible to play college basketball, he was led astray to an unaccredited prep school in Miami. He takes the blame for it now (\\"It was my mistake,\\" he says, \\"I should have checked up on it first\\"), even though he was just 16 when he went to Center of Life Christian Academy, trusting the advice of an AAU coach. Only a fraction of Mitchell's work at Center of Life Christian would count toward his NCAA eligibility. He transferred to Dallas' Pinkston High for his senior season and tried to retake core courses at an impermissible pace; a local school district investigation led to his transcripts being invalidated, and his graduation was delayed while he struggled with a state exit test. Mitchell remained at home in Dallas during what would've been his first college semester, and his eligibility saga dragged into January, when he got word that he'd never be able to play for the Tigers. Forced to choose between the junior college route or attending a four-year school as a partial qualifier, Mitchell enrolled at North Texas, where he's now a student paying in-state tuition. Mean Green coach Johnny Jones had aggressively recruited Mitchell out of high school and is hoping for a second chance to coach the local phenom. \\"We felt we were right there,\\" Jones said, \\"So when he committed to Missouri, it was like we lost a battle.\\" Mitchell needs to pass 24 credit hours to be eligible to practice with UNT on Dec. 17, following the conclusion of its fall semester, and potentially debut on Dec. 18 at home against LSU. Until then, he can't work out with the team, and has had to settle for dominating at the campus rec center, where he's become an intramural-league legend*. (* An actual message-board post inspired by one of Mitchell's games in February: \\"While getting beat by 30 in my rec game tonight I witnessed the greatest basketball player I've ever seen in person (not in the NBA)... Tony Mitchell. While playing in front of a crowd of about 100, at about 30% effort, he showed just how much better he was than anyone on that court. You can just tell that he is legit NBA prospect. My favorite was his between the legs power dunk on a fast break. I heart him. The end.\\" [sic]) Mitchell said that his progress toward that 24-credit goal was \\"beyond half done,\\" and that he's on track to join the North Texas team for the bulk of its season. It should be noted that he told me last summer that everything would be fine at Missouri, which didn't turn out to be the case, so his start date shouldn't be viewed as a lock. But Jones, too, expresses optimism that Mitchell will suit up this year, based on what the coach has seen out of his 2011 coursework. \\"Tony's been so focused and determined to have the opportunity to play,\\" Jones said. \\"If he stays that focused, he'll be on target to play on Dec. 18.\\" The one coach Mitchell has been able to play for this year is George Mason's Paul Hewitt, who headed the U.S. U19 team and considered the 6-8 forward a key defensive contributor. With potential interior stars such as Ohio State's Jared Sullinger and Kentucky's Terrence Jones and Anthony Davis turning down invites, the U.S.' only other frontcourt players were Florida's Patric Young, Illinois' Meyers Leonard, Creighton's Doug McDermott and Butler's Khyle Marshall, and Mitchell ended up playing 15.8 minutes per game backing up Young and McDermott. As raw as Mitchell is skill-wise -- the fact that he hadn't been in a college program for a year was evident in Latvia -- he still managed to post attention-grabbing numbers by crashing the glass and flying in from the weak side for blocks. A per-28-minute, tempo-free analysis of the U19s published at In-The-Game.org ranked Mitchell's efficiency rating (20.4) second in the entire tournament, behind only Lithuania's Jonas Valanciunas, who was the No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft and by far the best player in Riga. Mitchell only averaged half as many minutes (15.8 mpg) as Valanciunas, but had a higher rebounding rate (0.47 rpm) and block rate (0.11 bpm) than the future Raptors center. NBA scouts had been especially curious to see Mitchell, who as a high school senior beat out Baylor's Perry Jones -- a possible top-three pick in 2012 -- for the Dallas Morning News' area player of the year honors. And while Mitchell didn't do anything in Latvia that particularly wowed NBA evaluators, he made enough of an impact to warrant future visits to Denton, where he could grow into a first-round pick. \\"He's a great athlete, but he's just playing on instinct right now,\\" one scout said. \\"He hasn't developed a feel for the game yet.\\" Mitchell's athleticism alone will be enough to make him stand out in the Sun Belt, a conference that rarely features athletes of his caliber, and never lands recruits of his status. He longingly watched Missouri games on TV for the first half of 2010-11, wondering what he might've done in the Tigers' frontcourt, and thinks he could help the Mean Green, who lost their opening NCAA tournament game last March, pull off upsets in the postseason. \\"I'll be trying to make a huge impact right away,\\" he said. \\"I should make a huge impact. I'll be playing to win, and entertain at the same time -- you know, throwing down dunks, the usual.\\" It was hard not to laugh at Mitchell's secondary goal of \\"entertainment,\\" but that comment as a whole was indicative of how overeager he is to get on the floor in Denton. He's desperate to do something, anything, to prove that he's still an elite player, as opposed to a cautionary tale of a once-hyped recruit. All of his American frontcourt mates should benefit from their international experience; for Young and Leonard, it could set the stage for breakout sophomore seasons as they take on starting roles stateside. But for Mitchell, it was something else entirely: a respite from his academic purgatory, a reminder of how far he has to go to catch up to his peers, and for the first time in a year, the chance to function as part of a team. He needed the U19 trip more than did anyone else on the roster.

Doctors usually prefer to give patients vaccines instead of medications because the","completion":"latter often has side effects and does not provide long-term immunity. Vaccines, on the other hand, allow the body to build a natural defense against various diseases, thus preventing health issues from arising in the first place. Additionally, vaccines can be cost-effective and significantly reduce the risk of outbreaks and infections within communities. One day, in the busy city of Metropolia, a young doctor named Dr. Amelia Hayes was working tirelessly at Eden Health Clinic, a well-renowned medical facility known for its cutting-edge research and healthcare services. Dr. Hayes was passionate about preventative care, specifically through vaccination, and she displayed a genuine dedication to the wellbeing of her patients. On this particular day, Dr. Hayes received news about an emerging virus that had recently surfaced in a small village near the outskirts of Metropolia. The World Health Organization (WHO) had issued an advisory about the spread of this virus and called for immediate efforts to curtail the outbreak before it could escalate into a pandemic. Eager to find a solution, Dr. Hayes gathered a team of her most trusted colleagues, including Dr. Aaron Chen, a brilliant virologist, and Dr. Stephanie Michaels, a prominent epidemiologist. Together, they began their research on the new virus, painstakingly analyzing its structure, transmission, and potential impact on human health. Over the course of several weeks, the team of medical professionals dug deep into their studies and began to notice unique patterns in the virus' genetic makeup. This discovery proved instrumental, as it offered vital clues on devising an effective vaccine. Working day and night, Dr. Hayes and her team started developing and testing various formulations, driven by the urgent need to safeguard the residents of Metropolia and beyond. News of the impending virus threat caught the attention of the media, causing widespread paranoia and fear among the public. Desperate citizens flocked to Eden Health Clinic, pleading with Dr. Hayes and her peers for any treatment or preventative measures available. However, the process of creating a safe and effective vaccine took time, and the team had to delicately balance meeting the expectations of the public while staying true to their commitment to scientific research. Eventually, after numerous iterations and rigorous clinical trials, Dr. Hayes and her team succeeded in producing a promising vaccine candidate demonstrating both safety and efficacy against the new virus. Metropolia’s governing authorities promptly approved the vaccine for emergency use, allowing Dr. Hayes to initiate a mass vaccination campaign. Logistics proved to be quite a challenge, with limited resources and a frightened populace. However, Dr. Hayes was determined not to let these obstacles deter her from saving lives. She collaborated with various governmental and non-governmental organizations to roll out an organized and efficient vaccination drive, starting with the most vulnerable individuals and the frontline healthcare workers. Strict hygiene protocols, public awareness campaigns, and the tireless dedication of healthcare professionals like Dr. Hayes gradually diminished the prevalence of the virus. As the months passed, Metropolia and the surrounding regions continued to witness a steady decline in viral infections, thanks to Dr. Hayes and her team's persistent efforts. The newly-developed vaccine became a prime example of how preventative healthcare through vaccination saves lives, time, and resources, as well as spares countless people from unnecessary pain and suffering. In the end, Metropolia managed to avert what could have been a catastrophic pandemic, all due to the timely response, scientific prowess, and relentless determination of doctors like Amelia Hayes. The community realized the importance of vaccine-driven preventative healthcare, learned to appreciate and trust the expertise of medical professionals, and started to prioritize vaccination within their healthcare systems. Through a combination of education, empathy, and relentless determination, Dr. Hayes not only managed to save her city from an unnerving viral outbreak but also reminded the world of the power and significance of vaccine-driven preventative care, inspiring future generations to follow in her footsteps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago.

(CNN) -- Monsignor William Lynn, the highest-ranking cleric accused of imperiling children by helping cover up sexual abuse, was found guilty Friday of one count of child endangerment. He was found not guilty on a second count of endangerment and a conspiracy charge to protect a priest accused of abuse. The jury was unable to bring a verdict against his co-defendant, the Rev. James Brennan, who was charged with attempted rape of a 14-year-old altar boy and endangering the welfare of a child. Lynn was taken into custody after Friday's verdict, when the judge revoked his bail. His lawyer, Jeffrey Lindy, derided the decision not to let his client remain free on bond prior to sentencing, calling it \\"an unspeakable miscarriage of justice (for) a 61-year-old man with no prior record and long established ties to the community.\\" \\"Because of the","completion":"nature of the case and the gravity of the charges, Monsignor Lynn's conviction represents a monumental moment within both the Catholic Church and the larger discussions on sexual abuse within religious institutions. While many supporters argue that he has long served the community and should not be jailed immediately, the fact remains that his actions, or lack thereof, had a direct impact on the lives and well-being of vulnerable children. For years, cases of sexual abuse within the Church have been met with varying degrees of dismissal, denial, and secrecy. As allegations continue to surface, it has become clear that the Catholic Church's hierarchy has often been complicit in shielding abusers from the consequences of their actions, thereby allowing the abuse to continue. With the conviction of a high-ranking official like Monsignor Lynn, a glaring spotlight has been cast on the Church, forcing it to confront its patterns of internal mismanagement and cover-ups. The verdict in Monsignor Lynn's case is indicative of a significant shift in societal attitudes towards sexual abuse within religious organizations. As the public becomes less tolerant of abuse, figures like Monsignor Lynn serve as stark reminders of the need for transparency, accountability, and immediate action within the Church. Following the conviction, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia issued a statement expressing sorrow for the victims, emphasizing their commitment to supporting survivors and pledging to make necessary changes to prevent future abuse. The verdict has undeniably served as a deterrent for other religious institutions to be more diligent in addressing allegations of abuse and prioritizing the safety and welfare of their congregants—especially the most vulnerable members. In the coming months, Lynn's defense team will likely appeal the verdict and seek leniency in sentencing. While the outcome of these attempts remains uncertain, one undeniable fact is clear: the Catholic Church, and religious institutions as a whole, now face heightened scrutiny in addressing the sexual abuse crisis. As more survivors continue to come forward, the Church must listen, respond, and make meaningful reforms to protect, support, and seek justice for those who have suffered at the hands of clergy. In conclusion, although opinions surrounding Monsignor Lynn's immediate detainment may differ, it cannot be denied that his conviction serves as a seismic shift in addressing sexual abuse within religious institutions. It signifies a move towards greater accountability and an unwavering demand for the protection of vulnerable individuals. Society can only hope that this case marks the beginning of a new era in which faith-based organizations take meaningful steps to prevent any form of abuse from occurring in the future, and provide unyielding support to those impacted by the actions of malignant individuals.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hence, I would rate this aspect a 3 out of 5. 2. Details: The review provides some details, such as the amount of time taken (45 minutes) and the percentage of the update completed (28 percent). However, it doesn't mention what is being updated or any related issue. This lack of information makes it challenging to understand the problem's cause or offer possible solutions. As a result, I would rate the review a 2 out of 5 for details. 3. Constructive feedback: The review does not provide specific, actionable feedback for improvement. Although the user is clearly unhappy with the update's duration, they do not provide suggestions or elaborate on their expectations. On this criterion, I would rate the review a 1 out of 5. 4. Tone: The review is negative, using words such as \\"sucks\\" to convey the user's dissatisfaction.

When he was a small boy he got off to a poor start in arithmetic. His teacher got the idea that he had no ability in arithmetic, and told his parents what she thought in order that they would not expect too much of him. In this way, they too developed the idea, \\"Isn't it too bad that Alfred can't do arithmetic?\\" He accepted their mistaken estimate of his ability, feeling that it was useless to try, and that he was very poor at arithmetic, just as they expected. One day he became very angry at the teacher and the other students because they laughed when he said he saw how to do a problem which none of the other students had been able to solve. Adler succeeded in solving the problem. This gave him confidence. He rejected the idea that he couldn't do arithmetic and was determined to show them that he could. His anger and his new found confidence stimulated him to go at arithmetic problems with a new spirit. He now worked with interest, determination, and purpose, and he soon became extraordinarily good at arithmetic. He not only proved that he could do arithmetic, but he learned early in life from his own experience that, if a person goes at a job with determination and purpose, he may astonish himself as well as others by his ability. This experience made him realize that many people have more ability than they think they have, and that lack of success is as often the result of lack of knowledge of how to apply one's ability, lack of confidence, and lack of determination as it is the result of lack of ability.

Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end? How to swim backstroke perfectly Keep your body flat like a plank. When you're doing the backstroke, you want your body to lay as flat on the surface of the water as possible. The smaller your profile in the water, the less resistance you'll feel as you swim and the easier it will be to go fast. (a). Position your body as you begin the backstroke. First, do your standard front stroke, followed by a mid stroke, followed by a ste stroke (which is a fairly accurate stroke).. (b). Most people have a hard time getting their hips to float on the surface of the water, so they sink down a little below the surface. This is ok but try to keep your hips as close to the surface as possible.. (c). When your body is submerged, keep your feet about shoulder width apart. If you swim along a rigid surface, you'll be able to change direction when you rotate your toes.. (d). Balance your weight on the balls of your feet and keep your shoulders down and in profile.

Most people have a hard time getting their hips to float on the surface of the water, so they sink down a little below the surface. This is ok but try to keep your hips as close to the surface as possible.. (c). When your body is submerged, keep your feet about shoulder width apart. If you swim along a rigid surface, you'll be able to change direction when you rotate your toes.. Explanation: Option (a) is incorrect because it refers to different strokes and not specifically on how to swim backstroke perfectly, which is the main topic of the paragraph. The terms 'standard front stroke', 'mid stroke', and 'ste stroke' are also not relevant in swimming backstroke. Option (d) is wrong as it suggests to 'balance your weight on the balls of your feet'. This doesn't apply to swimming backstroke as you are on your back and not standing or balancing on your feet. On the other hand, Option (b) correctly adds to the instructions by giving advice on hip position during backstroke, which indeed should be as close to the surface as possible to maintain the flat body position. Finally, Option (c) provides relevant advice on foot positioning and movement while swimming backstroke, hence it's a correct choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nathan Charles Buckley (born 26 July 1972) is a former professional Australian rules football player, commentator and coach, best known for his time as captain of the Collingwood Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is currently the senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club. He is listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as one of the top 50 players of all time. Buckley won the inaugural Rising Star Award, in 1993, then went on to become one of the game's elite, captaining Collingwood between 1999 and 2007, winning the Norm Smith Medal for best player afield in the 2002 Grand Final despite playing in the losing team, only the third player in history to do so, the Brownlow Medal in 2003, winning Collingwood's Best and Fairest award, the Copeland Trophy, six times and named in the Collingwood Team of the Century. After months of speculation, Buckley signed a 5-year deal with the Collingwood Football Club. He was the assistant coach for the seasons of 2010 and 2011; he then became head coach in 2012, having taken over from Mick Malthouse, initially signing for a period of three years. Collingwood began the 2012 season shakily, losing to Hawthorn in round 1 and being thrashed by Carlton in round 3. However they recovered to win their next ten matches and finish the home-and-away season in fourth place with a record of 16-6. They were defeated by Hawthorn in the Qualifying Final before bouncing back to defeat West Coast in the Semi Final. However they lost comfortably to eventual premier Sydney in the Preliminary Final at ANZ Stadium to bring an end to the 2012 season. 2013 started poorly for the Magpies, slumping to a 5-4 record after 9 games. They couldn't quite find the consistency of previous seasons and finished the year in sixth place with a 14-8 record. They played Port Adelaide in their Elimination Final at the MCG and slumped to a shock 24-point loss, which caused Buckley to call into question the club's culture. Buckley's contract was extended until the end of 2016 by Collingwood in early March 2014, however Collingwood produced a poor performance in round 1 and lost to 2013 grand finalists Fremantle by 70 points. They ended up missing the finals to finish 12th partly due to an injury crisis. Collingwood started the 2015 season at 3-1 as of Round 4 and a gutsy win against Essendon on Anzac Day in 100th centenary of Gallipoli landing. At the end of Collingwood's 2017 season on 28 August 2017, Buckley was given a two-year contract extension by the club after it undertook a review of the entire football club.

Later teams with Denean broke the record for the slightly shorter 4x400 metres relay, after sister Atra graduated and the rest of the family moved to Kennedy High School (Los Angeles). Denean was the California High School Athlete of the Year at Kennedy in 1982, following in the footsteps of her sister Sherri. Also following her sister, she was named the national Girl's \\"High School Athlete of the Year\\" by Track and Field News, two years in a row. Her 1982 52.39 was the NFHS national high school record for eighteen years, before it was beaten by Monique Henderson. At age 15, she qualified for the ill-fated 1980 U.S. Olympic Team which was part of the 1980 Olympic Boycott finishing behind sister Sherri at the 1980 Olympic Trials, the first sisters to make the Olympic team simultaneously in the same event.

Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (; October 11, 1884 - November 7, 1962) was an American politician, diplomat and activist. She served as the First Lady of the United States from March 1933 to April 1945 during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office, making her the longest serving First Lady of the United States. Roosevelt served as United States Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952. President Harry S. Truman later called her the \\"First Lady of the World\\" in tribute to her human rights achievements. Roosevelt's chief project during her husband's first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. On August 18, 1933, at Hickok's urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, who had been blacklisted following union activities. Deeply affected by the visit, Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale, where they could make a living by subsistence farming, handicrafts, and a local manufacturing plant. She hoped the project could become a model for \\"a new kind of community\\" in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for. Her husband enthusiastically supported the project. After an initial, disastrous experiment with prefab houses, construction began again in 1934 to Roosevelt's specifications, this time with \\"every modern convenience\\", including indoor plumbing and central steam heat. Families occupied the first fifty homes in June, and agreed to repay the government in thirty years' time. Though Roosevelt had hoped for a racially mixed community, the miners insisted on limiting membership to white Christians. After losing a community vote, Roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and Jewish miners. The experience motivated Roosevelt to become much more outspoken on the issue of racial discrimination. Roosevelt remained a vigorous fundraiser for the community for several years, as well as spending most of her own income on the project. However, the project was criticized by both the political left and right. Conservatives condemned it as socialist and a \\"communist plot\\", while Democratic members of Congress opposed government competition with private enterprise. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes also opposed the project, citing its high per-family cost. Arthurdale continued to sink as a government spending priority for the federal government until 1941, when the U.S. sold off the last of its holdings in the community at a loss. Later commentators generally described the Arthurdale experiment as a failure. Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit in which she felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance. However, the residents considered the town a \\"utopia\\" compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency. Roosevelt personally considered the project a success, later speaking of the improvements she saw in people's lives there and stating, \\"I don't know whether you think that is worth half a million dollars. But I do.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: were the people of Arthurdale grateful to her?","completion":"Yes, the people of Arthurdale were grateful to her.

Write the next sentence, by choosing from: OPTIONS: a. He was relieved. b. Rex did his first ever cartwheel that day.","completion":"a. He was relieved. Upon completing the cartwheel, Rex felt a mixture of joy, accomplishment, and relief wash over him. Deep down, there had always been a lurking fear that he had completely lost his athletic touch as he left his gymnastics days behind in high school. This fear was often intensified as he found himself growing increasingly distant from the rigorous and exhilarating physical activities that he once adored. However, his friend's encouragement to simply try a cartwheel on the beach brought about a powerful realization. It showed Rex that, even with the passage of time and the changes that life had taken him through, the resilience and skill that had been cultivated during his time as a gymnast had not entirely vanished. In many ways, this simple cartwheel on the beach symbolized a reawakening for Rex. It proved that he had not, and could not, fully lose touch with the athletic aspect of his identity that had once played such a fundamental role in his life. It was a reminder that the skills he had honed years ago as a gymnast, though seemingly dormant, were very much alive, waiting to be rediscovered and explored. This realization opened up a realm of possibilities for Rex. Emboldened by the successful cartwheel, he began to seek out ways to reintegrate physical activities and gymnastics elements into his daily life. The world around him became a playground once again, as he found joy in practicing handstands, jumps, and balancing exercises. In time, Rex started attending local gymnastics classes, where he connected with like-minded individuals who shared his passion for the sport. Together, they pushed each other to refine their techniques and reach new heights, drawing from their past experiences and the unshakable spirit of determination that burned within each of them. Rex's newfound enthusiasm for gymnastics also had a ripple effect on the rest of his life. It taught him that growth often stems from stepping outside of our comfort zones and reconnecting with our past, even when we may not think that we have anything left to learn. Additionally, it demonstrated the power of encouragement and willingness to try something as seemingly simple as a cartwheel on the beach. Ultimately, finding the confidence to rediscover his gymnastics skills turned out to be one of the most valuable moments of Rex's life. Not only did it renew his love for gymnastics and help him forge meaningful connections with others, but it also served as a reminder of the importance of never giving up on a part of ourselves that once made us feel truly alive. The sense of relief that Rex felt that day on the beach was more than just the result of a successful cartwheel. It was the beginning of a personal transformation – one that would leave an indelible mark on his life for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When he learns that independent research has discovered a considerable presence of fecal matter in the meat, he travels to the fictitious town of Cody, Colorado to determine if the local Uni-Globe meatpacking processing plant, Mickey's main meat supplier, is guilty of sloppy production. Don's tour shows him only the pristine work areas and most efficient procedures, assuring him that everything the company produces is immaculate. Suspicious of the facade he's been shown, Don meets rancher Rudy Martin, who used to supply cattle to the Uni-Globe plant. Rudy and his Chicana housekeeper both assure him that because of the plant's production level, several safety regulations are ignored or worked against; workers have no time to make sure that the manure coming from the intestines stays away from the meat. Don later meets with Harry Rydell, executive VP of Mickey's, who admits being aware of the issue, but is not concerned. Amber is a young, upbeat employee of Mickey's, studying for college and living with her mother Cindy. While her life seems to be set, she continually faces the contrast between her current career and her own ambition, emphasized by her two lazy co-workers, Brian and Andrew, who, having heard of armed robberies at fast food restaurants in the area, start planning their own. Amber and Cindy are visited by Cindy's brother Pete, who encourages Amber to leave town and start a real career. Amber eventually meets a group of young activists, Andrew, Alice, and Paco, who plan to liberate cattle from Uni-Globe as their first act of rebellion. They proceed to sneak up to a holding pen at the plant, but after breaking down the fence, they are shocked that the cattle make no attempt to leave.

Help as much as you can. I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields.

What is the medical name for the large intestine of the human body?","completion":"The medical term for the large intestine of the human body is called the Colon. The colon is a vital part of the digestive system that plays an important role in processing and eliminating waste products and absorbing water, electrolytes, and vitamins produced by enteric bacteria. The colon consists of multiple parts which together help in carrying out these functions. The large intestine, commonly referred to as the colon, is divided into several segments, each with its specific names and functions. These segments are: 1. The cecum: This is where the colon begins and is the first section of the large intestine. The cecum is a pouch-like structure that connects the colon to the small intestine, specifically the ileum, through the ileocecal valve. The appendix, a small, finger-like projection, is connected to the cecum. 2. The ascending colon: The ascending colon is the next section and moves upward on the right side of the abdomen. Its main function is to absorb fluids and salts (electrolytes) and transmit the remaining contents to the next part of the colon. 3. The transverse colon: As the name suggests, the transverse colon is the segment that extends horizontally from the right side of the abdomen to the left side. This portion of the colon continues the absorption of water and electrolytes from the remaining undigested food material. 4. The descending colon: The descending colon begins on the left side of the abdomen and moves downward. This section of the colon is responsible for storing the remaining waste before they are excreted out of the body. 5. The sigmoid colon: The sigmoid colon is the S-shaped section that connects the descending colon to the rectum. Its function is to hold the fecal matter until the body is ready for a bowel movement. 6. The rectum: Though not directly a part of the colon, it is vital in completing the functions of the large intestine. The rectum is a muscular chamber that receives the fecal matter from the sigmoid colon and expels it through the anus during defecation. In summary, the medical name for the large intestine in the human body is the colon. It consists of several sections, including the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and eventually connects to the rectum. The colon plays a crucial role in the digestive system by absorbing water, electrolytes, and vitamins, and eliminating waste products from the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who tries to rescue a child trapped in a belltower? Daniel Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Resonance\\" Daniel, a fireman renowned for his mild demeanor and heroic deeds, leads a peaceful life in the small, serene town of Bedford. Until one fateful day, his world is turned upside down when he hears a sound that would haunt him incessantly - the anxious cry of a child echoing from the bell tower of the town’s dilapidated church that has been locked up and abandoned for years. The child, named Eli, is an adventurous and curious six-year-old who has an affinity for exploring abandoned places and collecting relics. He sneaked into the bell tower out of curiosity but accidentally tripped on some loose rubble, causing a floor collapse. He is now trapped in the towering structure that has become a nightmarish maze. Daniel learns about the situation through Eli’s friends who saw him sneak into the church but were too scared to follow. He immediately springs into action, negotiating the disintegrating stairs and loose floors of the tower, calling out Eli's name and reassured by the responding echoes indicating the child's consciousness. Battling the odds not just from the hazardous conditions inside the bell tower but also the ticking clock, Daniel, with his firefighting equipment, breaks through barriers and navigates with precise judgment and unparalleled bravery. All the while, the town's people remain vigilant and supportive outside the bell tower, their hopes dwindling with each passing hour. With time running out, Daniel gets into a fix – he has to traverse through a weakened floor that might give away under their combined weight. Making a tough choice, he decides to cross it alone, promising to return for Eli. Yet, as he crosses, the floor gives away despite his calculated efforts. Miraculously, he manages to hang on to the ropes of the bell tower which leads him to a safely reachable part of the floor below. Yet now Daniel is faced with a two-pronged dilemma – to find a safe route back up to Eli, and to do it quickly as the bell tower walls start to crumble. He hatches an ingenious plan utilizing his fireman's gear and the thick bell ropes. After multiple trials and sweat-drenching efforts, an exhausted Daniel hoists himself back to Eli. Clinging to each other amidst the collapsing tower, they miraculously navigate their way down, guided by Eli's knowledge of his previous exploration. As they walk out of the tower, just as it finally crumbles to the ground, the townspeople cheer in relief and joy. Daniel becomes a celebrated hero in the town of Bedford, and young Eli learns a valuable lesson about safety. Most importantly, a resonant bond forms between the two of them — one that encapsulates the spirit of humanity, resilience, and the strong bond shared in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

Step 4: Gather feedback In order to understand if this issue affected employee satisfaction, the office manager spoke with a few employees to gather their opinions on the lunch mishap.

Title: Little Murders Movie plot: Patsy Newquist (Marcia Rodd) is a 27-year-old interior designer who lives in a New York rife with street crime, noise, obscene phone calls, power blackouts and unsolved homicides. When she sees a defenseless man being attacked by street thugs, she intervenes, but is surprised when the passive victim doesn't even bother to thank her. She ends up attracted to the man, Alfred Chamberlain (Elliott Gould), a photographer, but finds that he is emotionally vacant, barely able to feel pain or pleasure. He permits muggers to beat him up until they get tired and go away.Patsy is accustomed to molding men into doing her bidding. Alfred is different. When she brings him home to meet her parents and brother, he is almost non-verbal, except to tell her that he doesn't care for families. He learns that Patsy had another brother who was murdered for no known reason. Patsy's eccentric family is surprised when she announces their intention to wed, then amazed when their marriage ceremony conducted by the atheistic Rev. Dupas (Donald Sutherland) turns into a free-for-all.Determined to discover why her new husband is the way he is, Patsy coaxes Alfred into traveling to Chicago to visit his parents. He hasn't seen them since he was 17, but asks them to help with a questionnaire about his childhood at Patsy's request.Alfred ultimately agrees to try to become Patsy's kind of man, the kind willing to \\"fight back\\". The instant that happens, a sniper's bullet kills Patsy, again for no apparent reason. A blood-splattered Alfred goes to her parents' apartment, New Yorkers barely noticing his state. He descends into a silent stupor, Patsy's father (Vincent Gardenia) even having to feed him.A ranting, disturbed police detective, Lt. Practice (Alan Arkin), drops by, almost unable to function due to the number of unsolved murders in the city. After he leaves, Alfred goes for a walk in the park.

', and the last one, \\" improvement \\".","completion":"Step 1: Collect and Analyze Current Grades Before attempting to improve your grades, you need to understand your current academic standing. Collect information about the subjects you are studying and your current performance in each of them. You can use report cards, progress reports, or consult your teacher to get the most accurate information. Step 2: Prioritize Areas of Improvement Based on your analysis, identify which subjects or assignments require immediate attention. Rank these areas according to their level of importance and impact on your overall grade. This will help you allocate your time and energy more effectively. Step 3: Set SMART Goals When setting goals for improvement, ensure that they are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For instance, rather than setting a vague goal like \\"get better at math,\\" opt for something more specific like \\"increase my grade in math from a C to a B by the end of the semester.\\" Step 4: Develop Effective Study Habits One of the most critical aspects of improving your grades is establishing effective study habits. Some examples of good study habits include: - Creating a consistent study schedule - Designating a quiet and organized study space - Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable sections - Using active learning techniques, such as summarizing information, asking questions, and teaching others - Taking regular breaks to prevent burnout - Reviewing class materials and notes regularly Step 5: Use the Notebook Approach In the notebook, use the columns you labeled as 'reason', 'what?', and 'improvement' to identify and address weaknesses in your academic performance. For each area of improvement, write down the reason for the poor performance (e.g., procrastination, lack of understanding), the specific topic or assignment that needs improvement, and the action steps you will take to address the issue. Step 6: Seek Additional Resources To further support your effort to improve your grades, seek additional resources and assistance. This might include: - Attending tutoring or study group sessions - Asking teachers for additional help or supplementary materials - Utilizing online resources, videos, or tutorials to solidify understanding - Partnering with a classmate for peer support and encouragement Step 7: Track Progress and Adjust Strategies Regularly track your progress towards your goals by monitoring your grades, assignments, and any feedback from your teachers. Use this information to evaluate the effectiveness of your strategies and make adjustments as needed to stay on track. Step 8: Practice Time Management Create a daily and weekly schedule to allocate your time effectively between various subjects, extracurricular activities, and leisure. Ensure you include time for completing assignments, studying, review sessions, as well as self-care and relaxation. This will help you maintain a healthy balance between academic responsibilities and personal well-being. By consistently following these steps, you will be well on your way to improving your grades in middle school and establishing habits that will lead to success in your academic journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In diesem erstaunlichen Sieg gelang es der israelischen Armee, drei der größten und mächtigsten arabischen Armeen - die ägyptische, jordanische und syrische Armee - entscheidend zu schlagen. Dieses beeindruckende militärische Unterfangen hätte eigentlich dazu führen sollen, dass sich der Staat Israel sicherer und stabiler in der Region fühlt. Zu Beginn des Sechs-Tage-Krieges im Jahr 1967 galt die israelische Armee als David, der gegen drei Goliaths ins Feld zog. Trotz dieses scheinbar ungleichen Kampfes gelang es Israel jedoch, all seine Feinde in einer beispiellosen Schlacht rasch zu besiegen und wichtige Territorien wie die Sinai-Halbinsel, die Golanhöhen und das Westjordanland zu erobern. Diese Siege demonstrierten die militärische Überlegenheit und Entschlossenheit Israels, seine Existenz und Unabhängigkeit als souveräner Staat zu verteidigen. Das Ergebnis dieses äußerst beeindruckenden Krieges hätte die Sicherheit des Staates Israels in der umkämpften Region des Nahen Ostens stärken sollen. Denn wenn man es schafft, trotz der gewaltigen Anstrengungen und Ressourcen, die auf Seiten der arabischen Armeen im Spiel waren, entscheidende Siege zu erringen, sollte das auch für zukünftige Konflikte ein klares Zeichen setzen. Allerdings sollte sich Israel trotz dieser militärischen Erfolge nicht in falscher Sicherheit wiegen. Die Zerschlagung der ägyptischen, jordanischen und syrischen Armeen im Sechs-Tage-Krieg hat zwar die militärische Überlegenheit des Landes unterstrichen, aber auch tief sitzende politische und soziale Spannungen innerhalb der Region entfacht. Diese Spannungen sind auch heute noch Gegenstand von Debatten und Verhandlungen, in denen es um den Frieden und die Stabilität im Nahen Osten geht. Daher sollte Israel trotz des erstaunlichen Sieges im Sechs-Tage-Krieg immer achtsam sein und weiterhin daran arbeiten, konstruktive Dialoge mit seinen Nachbarn aus Nahost zu führen. Nur so lässt sich eine langfristige Sicherheit und Stabilität in der Region erreichen, die auf Verständigung und Zusammenarbeit beruht."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"Adare Manor, located in Adare, County Limerick, Ireland, is an exquisite example of the neo-gothic architectural style. It is a stunning manor house and hotel set amid lush landscapes. This unique structure was designed by the renowned architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham in the mid-19th century. Lewis Nockalls Cottingham (1787-1847) was a highly respected English architect, best known for his work in the Gothic Revival style. As one of the pioneers of historic architecture preservation, Cottingham was instrumental in restoring many medieval churches and buildings in England throughout his career. His skillful understanding of Gothic elements, as well as his passion for preserving architectural heritage, made him an ideal choice for designing Adare Manor. The manor was commissioned by the second Earl of Dunraven, Windham Henry Quin, who sought to create an exquisite Gothic Revival country house as a response to the burgeoning industrial development of that era. The Earl's ambition was to produce a stunning building that showcased the best of Gothic design while also reminding the world of Ireland's rich architectural heritage. Construction began on Adare Manor in the 1830s, and it took almost 30 years to complete, spanning the architectural careers of both Cottingham and his later successor, Philip Charles Hardwick. While the manor's master plan was conceived by Cottingham, he passed away before its completion, and Hardwick then took over, bringing his own touch to the project. Adare Manor incorporates several architectural styles, most prominently featuring Neo-Gothic, Tudor, and Elizabethan influences. The building's exterior demonstrates the harmonious use of local limestone, enhanced by pinnacles, turrets, and ornate sculpted ornamentation, predominantly featuring heraldic motifs. One of the most remarkable features of Adare Manor is the symmetrical design of the structure, which includes several repeating elements - an innovative concept for its time. Within the manor's interior, visitors can find spacious rooms with intricate woodcarvings, ornate plasterwork, and vast neo-gothic windows allowing an abundance of natural light to filter through. The neo-gothic, grey limestone structure sits on an 840-acre estate along the banks of the River Maigue. The estate boasts exquisite formal gardens, lush woodlands, and a championship golf course – providing a tranquil contrast to the imposing manor house. The manor combines ancient aesthetics with modern luxuries, having been meticulously restored and reopened in 2017 as a five-star hotel, offering guests a one-of-a-kind experience in terms of accommodation, dining, and leisure. The adaptation of this historic building into a contemporary hotel required immense effort and careful consideration to preserve and restore the architectural heritage it represents. Yet, Adare Manor is a prime example of how it remains possible to breathe new life into these magnificent buildings without sacrificing their historical appeal. In summary, Adare Manor is a beautiful and elaborate neo-gothic manor house designed by the esteemed architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham. Its magnificent structure, with intricate details, symmetrical elements, and the seamless fusion of architectural styles, has made it a landmark in Irish heritage.

A Dinner of My Doing My friend scrunched up her nose. “You shot this?” she asked, referring to the two birds—or, rather, the breast meat from two birds—on the table in front of us on a recent night. “Maybe,” I said. “I shot two birds, a pheasant and a partridge. But we can’t be sure the ones I shot are the actual ones we’re eating right now. These are definitely from that same hunt, though.” “I could never shoot a bird,” she said. No, she could only eat one. And it’s that kind of disconnect, so prevalent, that made me curious to have a hand for once in killing an animal I was prepared to ingest. If I’m fine—if we’re fine—with someone else tackling that assignment in the service of our dinner, shouldn’t we be fine with tackling it ourselves? That was my thinking when I went hunting, for the first time, last week. I described that trip in a column, noting that hunters’ rights and potential inconveniences are often mentioned by opponents to new restrictions on firearms. I figured that a brush with hunting, no matter how fleeting or limited or contrived, might give me at least a few new insights into that opposition, a few new questions about it. And it did. Some readers wrote to me to complain that my experience of hunting wasn’t a wholly representative one. They’re right. It was confined to birds, and it was done not in the wild per se, but on a preserve, or hunting grounds, where pheasants and partridges are raised—and then let loose—expressly for hunters, or shooters, or whatever the right noun for those of us visiting preserves is. It’s hunting, of a sort, made convenient. Hunting lite. But such hunting isn’t uncommon at all. In Pennsylvania alone, as I noted in my column, there are more than 300 bird preserves. And to the extent that the birds in these preserves are raised only to be shot, well, the pork and beef and chicken that’s sold in supermarkets or served in restaurants come from animals that are raised only to be slaughtered, and usually from animals raised in much more confined circumstances than the birds on the preserve, which roam in large pens prior to their release. I visited the Pennsylvania preserve with the chef Seamus Mullen, whose restaurant Tertulia, which serves Spanish food in Greenwich Village, I adore. He had hunted many times before, and not only at preserves, and he offered to be my tutor and guide. Before we turned our attention to the actual birds, he had me shoot clay pigeons, for practice, because I’d never previously fired a shotgun. Or a handgun. Or a rifle. Or anything other than the kind of weapon you use in a game like laser tag, which I’ve played with nieces and nephews. He schooled me in gun safety. And only after that did the three of us—Seamus and I and a friend of his named Ernie Sabine, who is the designer and owner of the New York menswear and men’s accessory label Ernest Alexander—grab the preserve’s Brittany spaniel, which would find and flush out the birds for us, and spread out through the fields and forests of the preserve. Between us we shot 17 birds in all. I definitely shot one of them, a chukar partridge, or chukar, and probably shot another, a pheasant, though there was some confusion about who had hit that particular bird. And that elicited a strange brew of feelings. There was a bit of an adrenaline rush. Some nervousness. Some anxiety. Some squeamishness. Even some sorrow, for lack of a better word. And overarching all of this was indeed a sense that there was something honest about what I was doing, to the extent that I was taking ownership, if only partly and briefly, of how my food came to me and where it was coming from. I emphasize partly. Seamus gutted the birds. Seamus plucked and cleaned them. And he cooked them, for a dinner two nights later, to which I brought three companions. For the gastronomes out there, here’s a bit more detail about how Seamus cooked the chukar and the pheasant that we ate: He deboned the legs, ground the flesh and seasoned it with pimenton, garlic and other herbs. The ground meat was used in a paella-style rice made with brown chicken stock and with a jus that incorporated the birds’ innards. The breast meat of the birds was left on the bone, browned in duck fat, and then smoked over oak wood on a grill before being carved and served, in petal-shaped pieces, over the rice. On the side was a sauce made with the jus and with butter, sherry, several kinds of pepper and braised mushrooms, among other ingredients. On top of the rice Seamus put not only the breast meat but also a few pheasant eggs poached in duck fat. It was a great-looking dish, and if I were more adept with my iPhone’s camera, and hadn’t been taking the pictures of the meal in such a dark room, you’d see that. But I recounted Seamus’s construction of the dish not just as an exercise in food porn but as a bridge to the following observation: by the time the dish appeared in front of me, so much had happened—so much that I’d had no hand in—that I felt nearly as disconnected from it as if the meat had been bought from a butcher. I didn’t look at it or take a bite and think, “That’s my quarry. That’s my doing.” I thought, “That’s delicious, and apparently has something to do with my hunt the other day.” It didn’t taste better, worse, more or less immediate. It just tasted like dinner. With one difference. As I chewed one bit, one of my teeth clamped down on something small and hard: a bit of bird shot, apparently. In the final picture below, on the left of the plate, you can see something that looks round and metallic. That’s it.

Former police officer Ian Langford, pictured with his new wife outside court today, slept with two women he met after attending incidents at their home. A police officer who seduced and slept with vulnerable women while on duty has been jailed for 18 months today. Ian Langford, 46, who served with West Mercia Police in Shropshire, struck up relationships with two women after being called to attend incidents at their homes. Langford would visit the women, who he was having relationships with at the same time, during his shifts, Gloucester Crown Court heard. The father-of-one’s police radio was heard to go off during visits and he even called a police car to bring him back to the station, the court was told. Langford’s 'totally unacceptable' actions led to a trial collapsing in court - as he was sleeping with the key prosecution witness. He also illegally accessed police records to gain the contact details of one of his victims when she changed her phone number after their relationship ended. The court was also told how Langford was docked 13 days pay in 2008 by West Mercia Police for sleeping with a. vulnerable women after attending her home following a domestic violence. incident. Langford, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, who was supported by his new wife in court today, admitted two charges of misconduct in a public office for the relationships, which took place in 2012 and 2013. The judge sentenced Langford to nine. months for each count of misconduct in a public office, to run. consecutively - meaning a prison term of 18 months. He also made an order banning the identification of any of Langford’s victims. Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Langford that his actions had brought the police service into disrepute. 'You are not a man of good character because in 2008 you were reprimanded for committing a similar, if not identical, offence with another vulnerable woman,' the judge said. 'If you needed reminding that such behaviour was totally unacceptable, that incident should have deterred you. 'However, in May 2012, you met up with one victim. She was the victim of domestic violence, as had been the victim in 2008. 'She was looking for the protection of the law and the understanding of the police. You chose to seduce her when she was at her most vulnerable. 'Later, when the affair had come to an end you misused police data to discover her private phone number.' Prosecuting, Janine Wood said Langford. met his first victim in May 2012, after being called to her home to. attend a domestic violence incident. Langford 'immediately' began complimenting the woman and later contacted her on Facebook. The former officer, who served with West Merica police, would visit the women - who he was seeing at the same time - while on duty. He also called a police car to come and collect him following a meeting. 'She was vulnerable having suffered. years of abuse from her partner, Mr Langford gave her compliments and. support,' Ms Wood said. 'A sexual relationship began very soon afterwards.' The relationship ended a few months later and the woman changed her phone number. 'In December 2012, the command and control logs were accessed by Mr Langford and he obtained her phone number,' Ms Wood said. 'He sent her a text message minutes later.' In a victim impact statement, the woman said: 'As painful as it is to look back, when I think of the mental state I was in at the time I feel sick at how the authority figure in our community took advantage of me when he should have protected me.' The court heard how Langford met with a. second victim in June 2012 following a neighbourly dispute at her home -. which resulted in a trial. This meeting was while he was in a relationship with the first woman, the court heard. Ms Wood continued: 'He then began complimenting her inappropriately and gave her his email address and told her it was the address his wife didn’t know about,' Ms Wood said. 'He asked if he could kiss her and the relationship progressed. On a number of occasions she wrote in her journal and she recorded when sexual activity took place. 'That corresponded with Mr Langford’s GPRS tracker on his police radio. It was while he was on duty. 'There are exchanges of text messages which talk about what happened between them and mention him having to get a police car back to the station, confirming he was on duty at the time.' The relationship ended in June 2013, when the woman discovered Langford was engaged to be married to another woman, Ms Wood said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, the woman said: 'I thought I was safe with him but he left me with an enduring belief that the old stereotype of dodgy policemen is still very much alive and kicking, especially when it comes to vulnerable women. 'My feelings are unsurprisingly more emotional, I feel rejected - why did he do this? For kicks or thrills while supposedly on police duty?' The court heard how the man had previous relations with a domestic violence victim in 2008. Judge Jamie Tabor added: 'The. case was compromised when it came to trial because the defendant let it. be known that you were having an affair with the prosecution witness. 'As a. result, the case had to be dropped, although a restraining order was. imposed. Nothing could demonstrate better why police officers have to. conduct themselves in a exemplary manner. 'Both. your victims feel extremely let down by the police. You targeted women. when they were at their most vulnerable. You carried out the affairs. while actually on duty. 'Your behaviour has brought the police service into disrepute.' Representing Langford, Simon Hunka said his client had joined the police force in 1989. He said Langford had previously been married but wed his new wife following the end of his relationship with the second victim in June last year. The relationship with his first victim ended in August 2012, when she went on holiday with her children, Mr Hunka explained. 'He is someone who has shown deep remorse and shame for his behaviour, he doesn’t try to excuse it,' Mr Hunka said. 'He is not someone who has set out with a specific sinister agenda.' Mr Hunka said his client, father to his 11-year-old daughter, no longer works for the police force. 'This is someone who had a long standing is the community,' Mr Hunka said. 'He is from a respected and respectful family and he knows he has brought shame on to that.'","completion":"A police officer named Ian Langford did some very wrong things while he was on duty.

A few years ago we went fishing down the hill from a mushroom farm called Happy Pond. Since that time, there has been a lot of rain and we noticed Happy Pond had a green coating across the top of it. We also thought about going to a new pond in center of the park called Ridge Pond. We are hoping to catch a lot of fish to serve at our family reunion. Which pond will the family most likely catch more fish, Ridge Pond or Happy Pond? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is more likely that the family will catch more fish at Ridge Pond than at Happy Pond. There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion: 1. Fertilizer runoff: As mentioned, rain can dissolve fertilizer in the soil and carry it away, ending up in bodies of water. Being situated down the hill from a mushroom farm, Happy Pond is more susceptible to this runoff, increasing the nitrogen levels in the water. 2. Algae growth: With increased nitrogen levels, algae can grow out of control in bodies of water, such as what has been observed with the green coating across the top of Happy Pond. This excessive algae growth can have several negative consequences for the overall health of the pond and its inhabitants. 3. Oxygen depletion: Algae consume a significant amount of oxygen in the water, which may result in decreased levels of oxygen available for other aquatic life, such as fish. Additionally, once the algae die, the decomposers breaking down the dead tissue also consume oxygen, further depleting the available oxygen in the water. 4. Dead zone formation: When oxygen levels get too low, a dead zone can form – an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. This greatly reduces the chances of catching fish in that area. Happy Pond's green coating and history of nutrient runoff suggest that it may be approaching or is already within the dead zone territory. On the other hand, Ridge Pond, located in the center of the park, has not been reported to have issues with excessive algae growth or oxygen depletion. As a result, it is more likely to have a healthier aquatic ecosystem, which would support a greater number of fish for the family to catch. In conclusion, considering the factors of fertilizer runoff, algae growth, oxygen depletion, and potential dead zone formation, Ridge Pond would be the more suitable choice for the family to catch more fish for their family reunion. Happy Pond's current condition makes it less likely to support a thriving fish population, and therefore, the family is advised to opt for Ridge Pond instead."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Tracy?\\", is \\"an average employee\\" a valid answer? Possible answers: (a). Yes. (b). No. Answer:","completion":"(b). No. A detailed explanation for this answer is as follows: Describing Tracy as an \\"average employee\\" based solely on the information provided in the given scenario is not a valid answer. The information presented reveals that Tracy was able to perform her job function successfully, which eventually led to a raise from their employer. This indicates that Tracy was not just an average performer, but rather someone who effectively completed tasks and had a positive impact on their employer's evaluation of their work. When assessing an employee, various factors and criteria are considered to determine their overall performance and value within an organization. Some factors to consider include work ethic, teamwork, adaptability, communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and leadership potential. Simply labeling an employee as \\"average\\" without considering these additional factors can be misleading and insufficient in painting a comprehensive picture of their capabilities and contributions. It is essential to acknowledge that the term \\"average\\" carries a different connotation across industries and workspaces. Generally, an average employee is someone who meets minimum expectations set by their employer or someone whose performance is neither outstanding nor below standard. However, with the limited information provided, it is challenging to determine Tracy's performance relative to her colleagues or how she compares with the typical employee in her company or industry. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not recommended to describe Tracy as an \\"average employee.\\" Doing so could be a disservice to her and doesn't reflect the fact that her efforts led to a raise. Instead, it would be more accurate to describe Tracy as an employee who performed her job functions effectively, maintained a strong work ethic, demonstrated potential, and ultimately earned a well-deserved raise from her employer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It means getting new school bags and books, and seeing friends again after the summer holiday. My oldest son, 9-year-old Salem, asked me several times where we would go to buy a backpack, while my other son, 6-year-old Abdullah, asked what school would be like this year. For the last three years, school was a nightmare for many children and their parents as violence increased and there were more attacks on schools and teachers. As a result, many parents prevented their children from going to school. One of six children in this country did not attend primary school in 2009. Many kids who did attend school were accompanied by a parent for the entire day to make sure nothing happened to their children. For poor families or those with large families, back to school can be an expensive time. The government gives some help to those living in poor neighborhoods, and school bags, note books and other items are given for free. Most of the merchants who sell notebooks and pens now sell their products out on the street instead of in stores. They sit on the ground and lay their items on the ground or they have a small table to sell their goods. The bags cost between 10 and 20, while clothes and shoes cost between 20 and 30. I found all the things I needed for my sons and even bought something for myself. I spent about 50 on each of them, including school uniforms. At the end of the day, we returned to our home carrying many shopping bags filled with items that made my children happy and excited to go back to school.

Answer based on context: The Konbaung-Hanthawaddy war was the last of the many wars fought between the Burmese-speaking north and the Mon-speaking south that began with King Anawrahta's conquest of the south in 1057. Many more wars had been fought over the centuries. Aside from the Forty Years' War in the 14th and 15th centuries, the south usually had been on the losing side. But this war proved to be the proverbial final nail. For the Mon, the defeat marked the end of their dream of independence. For a long time, they would remember the utter devastation that accompanied the final collapse of their short-lived kingdom. Thousands fled across the border into Siam. One Mon monk wrote of the time: \\"Sons could not find their mothers, nor mothers their sons, and there was weeping throughout the land\\". Soon, entire communities of ethnic Burmans from the north began to settle in the delta. Mon rebellions still flared up in 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824-1826. Each revolt typically was followed by fresh deportations, Mon flight to Siam, and punitive cultural proscriptions. The last king of Hanthawaddy was publicly humiliated and executed in 1774. In the aftermath of revolts, Burmese language was encouraged at the expense of Mon. Chronicles by late 18th century and early 19th Mon monks portrayed the south's recent history as a tale of unrelenting northern encroachment. By the early 19th century, assimilation and inter-marriage had reduced the Mon population to a small minority. Centuries of Mon supremacy along the coast came to an end. How many Mon rebellions flared up between 1762 and 1826?","completion":"In the provided text, five Mon rebellions are mentioned as having occurred between 1762 and 1826.

In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution. - The Gilbert Islands (formerly Kingsmill or King's-Mill Islands) are a chain of sixteen atolls and coral islands in the Pacific Ocean about halfway between Papua New Guinea and Hawaii.

George McGovern rode the swirling social and political currents of America in the late 1960s and early 1970s to lead a political movement that permanently changed the nation in ways that we still do not fully understand. A mild-mannered Midwestern intellectual, World War II combat hero and son of a Methodist minister, he became the leading edge of a storm promising (or threatening, depending on your point of view) transformative change on a wide range of issues including foreign policy, the electoral process and the rights of women. It was a storm that gathered intense support and equally intense opposition in the senator's run for president against incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. While the nation's younger and more highly educated rallied to McGovern's standard, the \\"silent majority\\" were deeply troubled by much of what they believed to be the McGovern agenda. George McGovern, an unabashed liberal voice, dies. Ultimately, much of what George McGovern campaigned for in 1972 came to pass. Both major political parties have a system of nominating a president that is far more transparent, accountable and democratic than the systems that existed prior to 1972. McGovern was instrumental in rewriting the rules for selecting Democratic convention delegates to include women, minorities and young people. (Women, minorities and gays now have far more rights and protections than they did in 1972.) But the cutting edge of the 1972 campaign was about how America dealt with the rest of the world, how it chose and challenged its adversaries, and in particular, how it would resolve the Vietnam War. By gaining the Democratic nomination, McGovern became the leading opponent of the war; he challenged the usefulness of the 25-year strategy of containing the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and any other nation committed to or influenced by Communism. McGovern and many other political leaders in both parties argued that in opposing Communism or other types of totalitarianism, the U.S. had to be far more strategic -- that fighting in places like Vietnam, where the outcome would have little real consequence on our nation's global struggle against a failed ideology, squandered American lives and treasure. Greene: McGovern a strong man who overcame defeat. While the Nixon administration and conservative Republicans lambasted McGovern for those views, Nixon eventually signed a peace agreement that ended the war on terms no more favorable than would have been granted had the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment been adopted in 1970 -- an amendment that proposed a complete withdrawal of troops from Vietnam and would have saved thousands of American combat casualties. Here is part of the passionate speech -- bracingly relevant today -- that McGovern delivered on the Senate floor before the vote defeating the amendment:. \\"Every senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. This chamber reeks of blood. Every senator here is partly responsible for that human wreckage at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval and all across our land â€” young men without legs, or arms, or genitals, or faces or hopes. \\"There are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure. Do not talk to them about bugging out, or national honor or courage. It does not take any courage at all for a congressman, or a senator, or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in Vietnam, because it is not our blood that is being shed. But we are responsible for those young men and their lives and their hopes. And if we do not end this damnable war, those young men will some day curse us for our pitiful willingness to let the executive carry the burden that the Constitution places on us. \\"So before we vote, let us ponder the admonition of Edmund Burke, the great parliamentarian of an earlier day: 'A contentious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood.'\\" Highlights of George McGovern's life. Today, American businesses are seeking to broaden our commercial relationships with Vietnam, and American military advisers meet with the Vietnamese to suggest strategies that will help that country protect the territory it claims in the South China Sea from possible Chinese aggression. George McGovern never fully recovered from the drubbing he received at the polls in November of 1972. But the path that he pointed to was ultimately the path the country took, and the movement he founded drew thousands of men and women, who committed their lives to public service and who continue to contribute to their communities and their country 40 years later. George McGovern was never the extremist his opponents tried to characterize him as being. His subsequent electoral success in South Dakota was evidence enough of that fact. But he was a man of great vision and grace. He helped to educate a generation about the failures of a rigid and untextured accounting of our allies and our enemies, and about the importance of making smart choices when dealing with dangerous adversaries. Those are lessons as important today as they were in 1970. Politicians pay tribute. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott Lilly. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"George McGovern, a prominent American politician, World War II combat hero, and intellectual, has passed away.

Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Passage:In 1773, Christian VII of Denmark surrendered Oldenburg to Catherine the Great in exchange for her son and heir Paul's share in the condominial royal-ducal government of the Duchy of Holstein and his claims to the ducal share in the government of the Duchy of Schleswig; Oldenburg went to Frederick August, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck, the representative of a younger branch of the family, and in 1777 the county was raised to the rank of a duchy. The duke's son William, who succeeded his father in 1785, was a man of weak intellect, and his cousin Peter, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck, acted as regent and eventually, in 1823, inherited the throne, holding the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck and Oldenburg in personal union.

Information: - William \`\` Will '' Frischkorn ( born June 10 , 1981 in Charleston , West Virginia ) is a former professional road bicycle racer , who finished his career with UCI ProTour team Garmin - Slipstream . He retired from professional cycling in September 2009 to take up a non-racing role with the team . - The UCI ProTour was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada organised by the UCI (International Cycling Union). Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams relabelled UCI ProTeams will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races. - The UCI Road World Cup was a season-long road bicycle racing competition comprising ten one-day events. The competition was inaugurated in 1989, and replaced the Super Prestige Pernod International. In the first three years, the competition was sponsored by Perrier. The competition determined a winning individual, and a winning team - A cycling team is a group of cyclists who join a team or are acquired and train together to compete in bicycle races whether amateur or professional and the supporting personnel. Cycling teams are most important in road bicycle racing, which is a team sport, but collaboration between team members is also important in track cycling and cyclo-cross. - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour. It refers to both the tour of 28 events and an annual ranking system based upon performances in these.

To combine them, we'll add their coefficients: -5*z + 4*z = -1*z So, the simplified equation is: -5 = -1*z Step 2: Solve for z Now, our goal is to isolate the variable z on one side of the equation. Since the coefficient of z is -1, we'll need to divide both sides of the equation by -1 to solve for z: -5 = -1*z To isolate z, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -1: -5 / -1 = (-1*z) / -1 This simplifies to: 5 = 1*z or 5 = z So, the solution is z = 5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Against their initial instincts, they choose to save Floyd, outmaneuvering One-Eyed Jack's men and bringing their friend back to safety. Meanwhile, their bond deepens, and they realize that they must face the risks together if they are to uncover the treasure. Together, the trio solves the riddles and puzzles necessary to lead them to the treasure, stashed away in a hidden cave, deep within the ruthless desert.

Question: Who trick Vanessa into getting closer with Tony? Title: Odd Girl Out Movie plot: Vanessa Snyder (Alexa Vega) is a well-respected eighth grader in her school. She has a loving single, divorced mother, Barbara (Lisa Vidal), who is proud of her academically and socially successful daughter. Vanessa is also \\"in\\" with the popular clique, which consists of her best friend Stacy Larson (Leah Pipes), the queen bee, and Nikki Rodriguez (Elizabeth Rice), who is secretly jealous of the bond between her two friends. On the exterior of the circle is the outsider, Emily (Shari Dyon Perry), and the \\"wannabe,\\" Tiffany Thompson (Alicia Morton), who is dying to make it into the group. One day, Nikki tricks Vanessa into getting close to Tony (Chad Biagini), a boy whom Stacy (and somewhat Vanessa) has a crush on. A web of lies, nasty rumors, and manipulation ensues, and Vanessa is ostracized by the clique for \\"backstabbing\\" Stacy. Nikki gets Tiffany accepted into the clique, and Tiffany becomes Nikki's sidekick at bullying. Although Nikki is the main bully, Stacy plays her part by pretending she's still Vanessa's friend and not stopping the attacks. Vanessa is slowly pushed out of class activities, socially isolated and her tormentors create a website that bashes her. Although Emily tries to convince Vanessa not to go running back to the clique, Vanessa keeps attempting to seek reconciliation with Stacy, to disastrous results. One day, Vanessa tries to sit with the girls at lunchtime, but they reject her. Vanessa runs off into the girls' bathroom, and hides inside one of the stalls. The girls follow her in and verbally assault her until she cries. That night, Vanessa walks into her bathroom in her underwear where she suffers a nervous breakdown and chops most of her hair off. Then she starts skipping school, fearing the agony in the hallways. Stacy offers a fake truce to Vanessa, making it look like Vanessa copied one of Stacy's assignments when it was in fact vice versa. Once Barbara sees printed-out disdainful comments about Vanessa's hair, she tries to help by informing the school about the bullying....

Answer the following question: Information: - Aslanbek Soltanovich Bulatsev (; born in 1963 in Mikhaylovskoye, Prigorodny District, North Ossetian ASSR, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union) is an Ossetian politician and official. Bulatsev formerly worked as a tax chief in the Russian region of North Ossetia. On October 22, 2008, he was appointed Prime Minister of the Republic of South Ossetia by the South Ossetian parliament. Bulatsev was fired, according to the official decree, on health reasons, on 4 August 2009. He was replaced by Vadim Brovtsev, the head of a Russian construction company. - Senatus consultum ultimum (\\"\\"Final decree of the Senate\\"\\" or Final Act, often abbreviated SCU), more properly senatus consultum de re publica defendenda (\\"\\"Decree of the Senate about defending the Republic\\"\\") is the modern term (based on Caesar's wording at \\"Bell. Civ.\\" 1.5) given to a decree of the Roman Senate during the late Roman Republic passed in times of emergency. The form was usually \\"consules darent operam ne quid detrimenti res publica caperet\\" or \\"videant consules ne res publica detrimenti capiat\\" (\\"let the consuls see to it that the state suffer no harm\\"). It was first officially decreed prior to the fall of Gaius Gracchus in 121 BC, and subsequently at several other points, including during Lepidus' march on Rome in 77 BC, the Conspiracy of Catiline in 63 BC, and before Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC. The \\"senatus consultum ultimum\\" effectively replaced the disused dictatorship, by removing limitations on the magistrates' powers to preserve the State. After the rise of the Principate, there was little need for the Senate to issue the decree again. - South Ossetia, also known as the Tskhinvali Region, is a partially recognised state in the South Caucasus, located in the territory of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within the former Georgian SSR. Its population of 53,000 lives in an area of 3,900 km, south of the Russian Caucasus, with 30,000 living in its capital city of Tskhinvali. - An emergency is a situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or environment. Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath. - Boris Eliozovich Chochiev ( Russian : ; Ossetian : ; born 1 November 1957 in Styrkom , Tskhinvali district , South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast , Georgian SSR , Soviet Union ) is a former acting Prime Minister of South Ossetia . He became Prime Minister on 18 August 2008 , after South Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity had dismissed the former government and proclaimed a state of emergency . On 22 October 2008 , the South Ossetian parliament appointed Aslanbek Bulatsev as new Prime Minister . Before becoming Prime Minister , Chochiev served as first deputy minister , as well chief negotiator for the South Ossetian secessionist government . Chochiev was also a member of the Joint Control Commission . - A government or division of government (i.e. on a municipal, provincial/state level) may declare that their area is in a state of emergency. This means that the government can suspend and/or change some functions of the executive, the legislative and/or the judiciary during this period of time. It alerts citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. A government can declare a state of emergency during a time of natural or human-made disaster, during a period of civil unrest, or following a declaration of war or situation of international/internal armed conflict. \\"Justitium\\" is its equivalent in Roman law, where Senate could put forward senatus consultum ultimum. - Ossetia (Ossetic: , \\"Ir\\", \\"Iryston\\"; Russian: , \\"Osetiya\\"; Georgian: , \\"Oset'i\\") is an ethnolinguistic region located on both sides of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, largely inhabited by the Ossetians. The Ossetian language is part of the Eastern Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages family. The Ossetian-speaking area south of the main Caucasus ridge is recognized by most countries as within the borders of Georgia, but under the control of the Russian-backed \\"de facto\\" government of the Republic of South Ossetia. The northern portion of the region consists of the republic of North OssetiaAlania within the Russian Federation. - The Supreme Soviet (\\"Verkhóvnyj Sovét\\") was the common name for the legislative bodies (parliaments) of the Soviet socialist republics (SSR) in the Soviet Union. These soviets were modeled after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, established in 1938, and were nearly identical. Soviet-approved delegates to the Supreme Soviets were periodically elected in unopposed elections. The first free or semi-free elections were held during the \\"perestroika\\" in late 1980s. The soviets were largely rubber stamp institutions, approving decisions handed to them by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or of each SSR. The soviets met infrequently (often only twice a year for only several days) and elected the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a permanent body, to act on their behalf while the soviet was not in session. Under the 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitution the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet served as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviets also elected the Council of Ministers, an executive body. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late December, 1991, most of these soviets became the legislatures of independent countries. - The South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast (, Ossetian: ) was an autonomous oblast of the Soviet Union created within the Georgian SSR on April 20, 1922. Its autonomy was revoked on December 10, 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR, leading to the First South Ossetian War. Currently, its territory is controlled by the breakaway Republic of South Ossetia. - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital. - Tskhinvali (; ) is the capital of South Ossetia, a disputed region in Georgia. It has been recognised as an independent Republic by Russia and three other UN members.

Teacher:Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Python's learning stages are like going to school and learning new things every year: a) Stage 1: Learn the basics, like ABCs and 123s in Python. b) Stage 2: Learn how to use Python to solve problems. c) Stage 3: Learn advanced topics, like asynchronous programming. d) Stage 4: Practice and build projects with Python. e) Stage 5: Share what you've learned with others. Now, let's see if these two questions are the same. The first one is about learning asynchronous programming in Python, and the second one is about the learning stages of Python. So the answer is: a) no These questions are not the same, but they are related because asynchronous programming is part of learning Python."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Zimmerman says he's sorry Trayvon Martin's family had to bury their child; family calls apology insincere George Zimmerman, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News' Sean Hannity, called the shooting death of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin a \\"tragic situation\\" and \\"the most difficult thing I'll ever go through in my life.\\" The volunteer neighborhood watch leader spoke about details of the shooting, said he's sorry that Martin’s mother and father had to bury their child and, when asked if he regrets anything that happened that February night, he said, \\"No.\\" \\"I feel that it was all God's plan, and for me to second guess it or judge it,\\" Zimmerman shook his head. Martin's mother and father watched the interview and appeared on \\"Fox & Friends\\" Thursday morning. His mother and father both said Zimmerman's apology appeared insincere and were troubled that the man accused of killing their son considered it all \\"God’s plan.\\" \\"I don't understand what he was thinking by saying it was God's plan that he murdered our child,\\" Tracy Martin, the teen’s father said. \\"I really don’t understand what God he worships because it’s not the same God that I worship.\\" Sabrina Fulton, Martin’s mother, also appeared angered by the comment. \\"Why would God have him kill an unarmed teenager?\\" she asked. \\"It makes no sense.\\" During the interview with Hannity, Zimmerman said he followed Martin because he looked suspicious running between houses in the rain. Martin turned to confront Zimmerman and \\"asked me what my problem was\\" before the exchange escalated into violence, Zimmerman told Hannity in his first TV interview, conducted in an undisclosed location in Florida. The 28-year-old, with his attorney sitting by his side, said he reached into his pocket to find his phone to call 911 for a second time, and \\"I looked up and he punched me and broke my nose.\\" At one point Zimmerman said he heard Martin \\"telling me he’s going to kill me.\\" Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder for shooting and killing 17-year-old Martin on Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla., though he says he acted in self-defense. At first, \\"I didn't think I hit him,\\" Zimmerman said, adding he only found out later that Martin had died. Now he is in hiding and said he feels his life is in jeopardy, based on death threats he has received. He told Fox News that on the night of the shooting he had gone out to shop at Target -- \\"that's the last time I've been home.\\" The case drew intense national attention as speculation grew about the motives for the shooting, especially given that Martin was black. Zimmerman has white and Hispanic heritage. He dismissed suggestions by some that he acted out of racism. \\"I don't think it's fair that they rushed to judgment to assume that,\\" he told Fox News. Police initially declined to press charges, citing Florida's so-called \\"Stand Your Ground\\" law. But a special prosecutor who was called in to investigate concluded that the evidence didn't support Zimmerman's claims, and the murder charge was filed. When asked what he would say to Martin's parents, Zimmerman said, \\"I would tell them that, again, I'm sorry.\\" \\"My wife and I don’t have any children,\\" Zimmerman told Hannity. \\"I have nephews that I love more than life. I love them more than myself. And I know when they were born, it was a different unique bond and love that I have with them. And I love my children even though that they aren’t born yet. \\"I am sorry that they buried their child. I can’t imagine what it must feel like. I pray for them daily.\\" Zimmerman, who is free on bond in Florida while awaiting trial, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. Hannity had spoke with Zimmerman, 28, off the record in April when he contacted Hannity against the advice of his attorneys. Both Hannity and Zimmerman denied claims that Hannity offered the murder suspect any financial assistance or payment. The interview concluded with Zimmerman looking into the camera and saying that he wishes the night hadn't ended in Martin's death. \\"I do want to tell everyone, my wife, my family, my parents, my grandmother, the Martins, the city of Sanford and America that I'm sorry that this happened,\\" he said. \\"I hate to think that because of this incident, because my actions, it's polarized and divided American. And I'm truly sorry.\\" What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a man named George Zimmerman who was involved in a situation where he shot a teenager named Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman says he is sorry that Trayvon's parents had to bury their child, but Trayvon's parents think his apology is not genuine. Zimmerman believes what happened was part of God's plan, which Trayvon's parents do not agree with. Zimmerman is being charged with second-degree murder, which means he is being accused of causing someone's death on purpose.

From the reviews it is clear that a lot of people did not understand the movie. I write this in an attempt to explain it to those who already saw the movie. John (Scott Adkins) seems to wake up from a coma, after 9 months - or so he is told - still freshly remembering how a guy named Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) brutally killed his family. The truth however is that this John is a new clone, with implanted memories of a non-existent family. Obviously, also the killing did never happen. An FBI agent (Rus Blackwell) has some \\"questions\\" for John as soon as he wakes up, showing him a photo of the killer and providing John with a name. The objective of this all is to make John think he has free will and make him want to hunt down and kill Deveraux. Deveraux is wanted badly by the government because he's running an underground organisation that frees clones like John from the government and gives them the truth and gives them back their free will by removing any false memories they might have. When John goes out exploring he meets people that he never saw before (obviously, he was just born) but who seem to recognize him. At this point we don't know much of the background story yet, so it's a real mystery when we learn on a few occasions that John apparently can be very violent. First we hear from his ex-girl friend that he once beat a man half-to-death in front of the club where she works (which is why he isn't welcome anymore there), then we meet a guy in some storage building who looks awfully deformed with scares, which apparently is the work of John and reveals that John killed a good friend of himself! At last John finds his former clone, and things become more clear: the previous John had been sent on the same mission - albeit without the false memories about having a family. This John has been freed by Deveraux and worked for him for a while, until he felt he was now the slave of Deveraux instead of the government and left him. Meanwhile Deveraux and his recruits are also hunting John, thinking he is the traitor who left them. After our John kills Magnus, the guy that is hunting him (Andrei Arlovski), finds the first John and kills him (because he attacked the girl, not sure why myself), things change. He lets himself get captured by Deveraux's men and is finally revealed the real truth. They offer him to remove his false memories which at first he agrees to. However, when he is at the verge of losing the memories of his wife and daughter, he freaks out and goes on a killing spree instead, holding on to his memories as real. So, in the end, the government seems to succeed in their plan that making it a personal matter for their clone was the key to get through to Deveraux. What they did not foresee however is that John also holds the government responsible for his pain, whether or not Deveraux killed his family or not: if he did then the government set him up to it in order to make him want to kill Deveraux. It's the same to John. After Deveraux let himself be killed, John is now the respected leader of the other universal soldiers. The story gets in a stream acceleration in the end, because apparently they went and got the last container that had to be sent \\"upstream\\" which contained the last equipment needed to clone people. When John meets with the FBI agent again he is not alone. The agent boosts about his achievement (by giving John false memories) but John kills him... and replaces the agent with a clone. From there we can guess what kind of fight is going to follow, but I suppose that will indeed be part of a future movie.

In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity that could be carried, or stolen. Therefore, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to make sure of the fact, however, untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building' s design made it appear strong, the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol showed the general attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Except pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a tangible commodity has largely been replaced by credit. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable factor is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank.

They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any non-living matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats.

Emily took weekly lessons: This choice does not make sense in the context of the comparison, as the sentence already establishes that Emily is an experienced boxer. Therefore, mentioning her taking weekly lessons does not help to emphasize or develop the comparison. ii. Kayla took weekly lessons: This choice makes more sense. Considering Kayla is a novice in boxing, it would be logical to mention something about her working to improve her skills. Therefore, by saying \\"Kayla took weekly lessons,\\" it can be understood that even though she is currently less experienced than Emily, she is actively working on developing her boxing ability.

A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis.

They say patience is a virtue seldom found in women and never in men. This may or may not be true, but it's fair to say that there is nobody on the earth who couldn't benefit from more patience. Patience is necessary for success. It is said that \\"all good things come to those who wait\\". Many of the great scientists have remarked that their scientific discoveries came only through patient perseverance . Edison said, \\"Genius was 99% perspiration and only 1% inspiration.\\" Patience teaches us to value the effort and not just the success. It is a mistake to think that happiness can only be obtained through achievements. Patience brings peace of mind. When we desire certain outcomes , we'll have no peace of mind. Even if one desire is filled, the nature of desire is that more will appear in its place. There is no end to human desires. Patience means we will work with an attitude of detachment . Patience can transform suffering into joy. Throughout life we suffer injustice; the best healer is patience. Through being patient and accepting our situation, it's quite possible for our suffering to be transformed.

To better understand the reasoning behind this classification, let's first break down the phrase and analyze its components. 1. 's: This is a contraction of the verb \\"is,\\" which implies a state or condition. 2. plenty: This word denotes an ample amount, suggesting that there is more than enough of something. 3. to enjoy: This phrase indicates an opportunity for deriving pleasure or satisfaction from something.

Options: - expansion - relaxation - soap - revenge - loss of heat Explain why a human would choose \\"revenge\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"revenge\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Contextual understanding: The context of the question involves Lance's emotional state and behavior, specifically about him being a hothead and trying to improve. In this context, \\"revenge\\" is the option that is most directly related to emotions and behaviors. 2. Eliminating irrelevant options: Each of the other provided options can be considered irrelevant or less relevant to the core issue at hand, which centers around Lance's emotional state and actions as a hothead. a. Expansion: This term is likely unrelated to the context, as it is more likely to refer to growth or enlargement of a non-emotional concept, such as a business or object. b. Relaxation: While relaxation may contribute to Lance's ability to cool off, the question implies that he already removed himself from the situation and spent time cooling off. Thus, relaxation isn't directly connected to what he didn't need. c. Soap: This option seems irrelevant, as it is a physical object typically used for cleaning and has no direct connection to Lance's emotional state or actions. d. Loss of heat: This term could be interpreted literally (as in losing physical heat), making it irrelevant to the context, or metaphorically (as in not being upset anymore). However, since Lance has already taken actions to cool off, the loss of heat isn't directly relevant to what he didn't need in this case. 3. Understanding human emotions: Humans typically choose revenge as a response to negative emotions such as anger or perceived injustice. In the context of Lance's situation, the fact that he was a hothead and removed himself from the situation to cool off implies that revenge is the most suitable option he didn't need to improve his emotional state or control his hotheaded tendencies. 4. Relating to the process of improvement: The question highlights Lance's efforts to improve by removing himself from the situation and cooling off. Choosing revenge as something he didn't need emphasizes his progress and implies that he is making an effort to move away from destructive behaviors like seeking revenge on others."},{"prompt":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Florida millionaire on trial for wife's death But prosecutors painted a very different picture, casting doubt on Ward's unruffled demeanor and what they characterized as his ever-changing story of what happened. \\"This case is about the fact that it was Bob Ward that shot her almost dead between the eyes,\\" said Assistant State Attorney Robin Wilkinson in her opening statement. She brought up the 911 call, placed at 7:50 p.m. that night, in which Ward called and flatly said, \\"I just shot my wife.\\" But later in the call, according to Wilkinson, he started to change his story: \\"It becomes an accident and he doesn't know what happened ... Diane just ended up on the floor.\\" According to the arrest affidavit from Orange County Sheriff's Office, the victim was found in the master bedroom -- \\"a large pool of blood at the top of her head (and) a .357 Magnum hand gun (in) the top drawer of a nightstand next to the bed.\\" Ward told police that the couple were the only ones in the house at the time, besides their four dogs. Wilkinson also brought up how Ward acted upon arriving at the police station, during which investigators described him as \\"calm, polite and not really in distress.\\" In several videos from an interrogation room -- which the prosecutor promised would be played in court -- Ward offered an array of stories in phone conversations with family and friends, from \\"It was a tragic accident\\" to \\"Diane killed herself.\\" The next day, medical examiner Joshua Stephany determined preliminarily that the mother of two college-age children had been killed in a homicide.

Trump goes nuclear on Carson, Fiorina **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

But how will he fare in his fresh feuds with fellow outsiders Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina? A week ago Trump said he hoped Carson would “hit” him, because Trump “love[s] to counterpunch.” Does he ever. Carson, who is gaining fast on frontrunner Trump in a new poll today, took a mild shot at what Trump’s self-described “big league” Christian faith. Pressed by reporters during a campaign stop in Anaheim, Calif., to respond to Trump’scriticisms that Carson isn’t qualified to be president, the retired neurosurgeon initially declined. But when asked to contrast himself with the New York billionaire, Carson responded, “…I realize where my success has come from, and I don’t any way deny my faith in God,” said Carson. Carson went on to cite favorite scriptures that “humility and fear of the Lord are riches in honor and life,” saying that he didn’t get “that impression with” Trump. That was a swipe at Trump who bragged that he likely hadn’t ever felt the need to ask God’s forgiveness. On CNN today, Trump unloaded on Carson: “Look at his faith and you’re not going to find so much. And you look at his views on abortion which were horrendous, and that’s I think why I’m leading with all the evangelicals. I’m leading Ben Carson by a lot I’m almost double his numbers.” “But I don’t know Ben Carson, perhaps – you know – an okay doctor…we’re not talking about a great – he was an okay doctor.” “And now, because he’s a doctor and he hired one nurse, he’s going to end up being president of the United States?” “For him to read from the Bible in his memory, it looked like it memorized it about two minutes before he went on stage.” But Carson isn’t the only target of Trump’s wrath. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who also gained ground on Trump in CNN’s poll out today, got a dose too. In an interview with Rolling Stone Trump mocked Fiorina’s appearance: “‘Look at that face!’ he cries. ‘Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!’ The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. ‘I mean, she’s a woman, and I’m not s’posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?’” Fiorina declined to respond in kind during an interview on “The Kelly File” saying instead, “I’m not going to spend a single cycle wondering what Donald Trump means. But maybe just maybe I’m getting under his skin a little bit because I’m climbing in the polls.” In a phone call to “Fox & Friends” today, Trump claimed he was not referring to her appearance but instead, “about persona.” But as Trump’s own comments to Rolling Stone make clear any disparagement of women’s appearances is a fraught subject for the GOP frontrunner. Trump did not, however, shy away from continuing to attack Fiorina’s record as a businesswoman and her qualifications to be president. Given the strong favorable views of Republicans voters towards Fiorina and Carson, Trump’s attack-dog approach with his fellow outsiders looks to be a much riskier gambit than his ceaseless trolling of the beleaguered Bush. WALKER JOINS FALL FASHION TREND WITH RE-BOOT AP: “Republican Scott Walker plans to talk about ‘wreaking havoc’ on Washington D.C. with a Thursday speech at the alma mater of former President Ronald Reagan. Walker's presidential campaign on Tuesday released excerpts of his speech to be delivered at Eureka College in Illinois. Walker is also expected to release weekly ‘day one’ promises that describe action he would plan to take on his first day as president. Walker has already said he will end the Iranian arms deal and propose repealing and replacing the federal health care law on his first day in office. The speech and weekly release of ‘day one’ promises comes as Walker is trying to regain ground after being among the top tier of Republican candidates, only to see his standing drop in recent polls.” [The Atlantic’s Molly Ball goes back to where it all began to look for Walker’s path forward: “For the past four years, Walker has dominated Wisconsin. His bold agenda shattered the status quo, he shocked the left and united the right, and he couldn’t be beat. Recalled in 2012, challenged in 2014, he kept on fighting and kept on winning. … For Wisconsinites accustomed to Walker’s dominance, his fall from glory nationally has been disorienting and out of character. Back home, he has always been focused, disciplined, on-message to a fault.”] Jeb gets a little Trump-y in tax plan - NYT: “Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida challenged some long-held tenets of conservative tax policy on Wednesday by proposing to curtail valuable deductions that benefit businesses and the wealthy and eliminate a loophole that has benefited hedge fund and private equity managers for years. That an establishment Republican candidate has embraced such changes not only highlights how income inequality has altered the tenor of the presidential debate for the party, but also indicates the ideological pull Donald J. Trump’s candidacy is having on the Republican field after he made similar proposals.” [Bush will talk about his tax policy and hold a town hall in New Hampshire today.] Koch group applauds - Conservative group Freedom Partners praised the GOP candidates who have come out with detailed tax reform plans. President Marc Short said in a statement, “We applaud Governor Jeb Bush, as well as Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, for providing detailed plans to lower rates, reduce corporate welfare and simplify the tax code.” Freedom Partners supports reducing tax rates, and ending corporate loopholes.

David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and high-school classmate of Christie, pleaded guilty in May... The fall of United’s CEO is the latest sign that prosecutors may be building a case in their spinoff investigation of David Samson, the influential lawyer who chaired Christie’s gubernatorial transition and later the Port Authority.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Of the many theories that exist about human evolution the latest find from explorers in South Africa proves to be the most revolutionary. National Geographic brings today’s biggest science story of two recreational cave divers stumbling upon a new species of human ancestor called Homo naledi. Steven Tucker and Rick Hunter found a cave outside Johannesburg looking for a new adventure in an area known for fossil discoveries, and research. Although much of the area has been trodden over, Tucker and Hunter were hoping to find a new path or a less-explored area. In a narrow cave, barely big enough to fit them through, they found they would be far from disappointed, discovering what appeared to be a vast collection of human bones. But how did this cave collect so many bones? Is it possible that this species buried their dead in some way? Check out this deep read for an account of their findings here.

THE JUDGE’S RULING: TWO WRONGS DON’T MAKE A RIGHT Though he believes that the decision to incarcerate Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis wasn’t the right course of action, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says Davis’s argument in refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because of her religious convictions is flawed: “The Free Exercise Clause guarantees individuals the lawful ability to practice their religion free from government interference.

A plant grows near or on a rock - This step is not directly impacted by the perturbation (rocks breaking up less). 2. The plant roots begin to grow - This step is also not directly impacted by the perturbation. 3. Break apart the rock - This step is directly impacted by the perturbation as less breaking up of rocks is mentioned. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - This step can be indirectly impacted since less breaking up of rocks might lead to less surface area exposed to plant acids. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - This step can also be indirectly impacted because the less breaking up of rocks initially might lead to fewer pieces to be further broken down. Overall, the supposed perturbation has an indirect impact on the process that leads to soil erosion. The main steps impacted are steps 4 and 5, where less breaking up of rocks could cause the plant acids to dissolve less rock material and reduce the further breaking down of rock pieces.

(T) is refining its retail strategy with its first flagship store, a location on Chicago’s Michigan Avenue that goes beyond phones and tablets to show services such as fitness applications and “smartcar” features. The 10,000-square-foot (929-square-meter) store, opening Sept. 1 in the shopping mecca known as Chicago’s “Magnificent Mile,” is three times larger than the average of the company’s 2,300 retail outlets. Located across the street from Coach Inc. and Cartier Ltd. stores, it has cement floors, white plastic and reclaimed teak furniture with more than 100 video displays. With the loss of its exclusive agreement to sell Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s iPhone and a saturated wireless market that makes it hard to find new subscribers, Dallas-based AT&T is planning to use its stores to gain an edge against Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) and T-Mobile USA Inc. The move also pits AT&T against the standard-bearer in consumer-electronics retail, Apple itself. “We are very different than Apple,” Paul Roth, AT&T’s president of retail sales and services, said in an interview. “In their stores, the product is the hero. This store is all about the experience.” The second-biggest U.S. wireless carrier is looking for ways to show investors it’s a bargain. Investors are getting a 29 percent discount for AT&T compared to its telecommunications peers on a price-to-earnings basis, up from 18 percent at the end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AT&T shares fell 0.4 percent to 36.69 today in New York. No Shadowing Roth’s plan is to blend the hands-on approach of Apple stores with a visually dazzling environment. He’s requiring sales staff to greet visitors within 10 seconds or 10 feet after they’ve entered the store, to make them welcome without shadowing them, he said. Emulating Apple doesn’t guarantee success. Nike Inc. (NKE), Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. have each tested the brand- centered retail approach, with mixed results. Nokia, the Espoo, Finland-based mobile-phone maker, has shut stores in New York, Chicago, London and Mexico City in the past three years after starting its own retail chain in 2005. AT&T has tried to give its store a customer-friendly makeover before. In 2007, it opened its first “AT&T Experience” store, a 5,000-square-foot Houston location with sales kiosks and product demonstrations. App Lounge The Chicago flagship goes beyond the Experience concept, which AT&T has dropped. At the front of the new store is an 18- foot wall of video screens and an App Lounge where people can use 55-inch monitors to test apps for Apple products or for Google Inc.’s Android system. The shop’s open layout has a series of “boutiques” where customers can see demonstrations on how to prepare for the Chicago Marathon or examine the texting safety features on a Nissan Leaf. “Customers are overwhelmed by technology,” Roth said. “They want to know less about the device and more about what it can do for them.” The store has 40 employees with as many as 30 on the sales floor at one time, Roth said. There are no cash registers, with staff using tablets or smartphones to make sales. Flagship stores help companies immerse their customers in everything they have to offer, said Michael Cote, a wireless strategist with the Cote Collaborative in Chicago. “These are branding opportunities more than retail outlets,” Cote said. “And what’s important here is that AT&T will be the first carrier to have an ‘experiential’ flagship store on the Magnificent Mile.” Verizon Overhaul Verizon Wireless, which has a store about two blocks away from AT&T on Michigan Avenue, has started an overhaul of its stores to keep up with the trend in retail toward giving customers more access to sample devices. The nation’s largest wireless carrier plans to have 60 stores outfitted this year with a new look featuring white interiors with blond wood, fewer counters separating staff from customers and products displayed on tables instead of walls, said Thomas Pica, a Verizon Wireless spokesman. The Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based company hasn’t designated a flagship store, he said. Sprint has had a flagship site in New York, prominently located on the first floor of the angular Flatiron Building, since 1997. Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) unit T-Mobile’s flagship is also in New York, near Times Square. The model for success with a self-branded store is Cupertino, California-based Apple, said Lee Peterson, executive vice president of creative services at WD Partners, a retail strategy and design company based in Dublin, Ohio. “There’s no magic bullet,” said Peterson, whose clients include Best Buy Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. “Gimmickry doesn’t work. Lounges don’t work. We try to convince clients that it’s what the salesperson knows about the customer and the product that matters.” Apple, which had 372 stores around the world at the end of June, is preparing to introduce the next version of the iPhone on Sept. 12, two people with knowledge of the company’s plans said last month.

All you needed was the biggest bomb, and everyone else kept their mouths shut. Then more people figured out how to make that bomb. And then all sorts of other threats–biological agents, computer viruses, and UAVs–complicated the landscape. advertisement advertisement Consider this in the context of AT&T. There was a time when AT&T controlled the world–or at least iPhones. Before too long, however, AT&T had lost its exclusive on Apple’s category-crushing product, and a loosely organized association of Android phones clouded consumer preference again. So what does AT&T do now? They’re no longer the only carrier with the most coveted phone. Their net income is up and customer churn has been low, but its biggest tactical advantage has been squandered. Now it’s time to take this battle to the street. Specifically, Chicago’s busy Michigan Avenue. That’s where, this weekend, following a few years of planning, AT&T is opening its first ever flagship store. There, as 60,000 people per day pass by Cartier, Louis Vuitton, and Coach, they’ll see AT&T’s new 10,000-square-foot retail mecca, a store that AT&T hopes to “bring life to the brand,” according to store manager Christina Cheng. View the Tour Here Upon entering the store, you’ll first see an atrium ringed with LEDs. Employees will be on hand to greet all the customers, I’m told, because AT&T’s focus groups have discovered that it’s personal greetings that make customers feel welcome–not architectural bells and whistles. Even customers carrying phones from Verizon and T-Mobile can play with a nearby touchscreen table loaded with AT&T’s favorite apps. Just click a category, preview the page, and then download it on your smartphone through Bluetooth, QR code, or a simple URL. advertisement Tucked in a corner nearby, a stage backed by a small tower of LCDs allows customers to play head-to-head, Kinect-style motion games. Does this have much of anything to do with AT&T itself? Not really, but it supports “a vibe of exploration” Cheng tells me. This stage will double as a place for both product announcements and presentations from local app developers. That area is just an iPhone’s throw from a (shorter) electronics table featuring apps and gadgets for kids. The App Bar is in the same vicinity, staffed by App Tenders. Unlike Apple’s Genius Bar–the clear line of inspiration here–these staffers don’t handle any serious problems. Rather, they suggest apps based on your tastes, “like your local barista would recommend something for you,” Cheng says. Again, it reinforces the casualness of the store–it’s so casual, in fact, that it doesn’t even have a checkout counter. Employees ring up customers at mobile terminals. The deeper diagnostic work is tucked in the back, a series of cozy tables for one-on-one conversations, all wrapped in a studio space filled with large splash walls of Chicago designers who’ve designed limited edition, custom cases only available at AT&T’s flagship. It’d be easy to simply label the whole experience an Apple Store clone. And indeed, you do feel Cupertino’s influences, from the App Bar to the expansive open tables full of electronics. But if the Apple Store feels like a modern museum that you’re free to touch, AT&T’s flagship feels more like a rich person’s basement loaded with toys. The store is one wood-burning oven away from doubling as a high-end pizza and wine bar. I’m also reminded a bit of REI as I walk past the Lifestyle Boutiques–tables dedicated to particular interests, like health and fitness, productivity, and photography/sharing. Cheng tells me that she’s staffing these tables with knowledgeable experts (much like the staff at REI always seems to be scraping the mud off their boots before walking into work). A former photojournalist will introduce shoppers to their photography peripherals. A certified personal trainer will be discussing Fitbits and tablet connectivity. Across the store, AT&T has set up its Experience Platform, which is pretty much a big budget CES booth come to life. Each space represents part of a consumer’s life, from a Nissan Leaf parked in the corner, which shoppers can enter and play with in-car phone connectivity, to a model kitchen outfitted with AT&T’s beta home automation software, to a four-couched living room set up, filled with Xbox 360s and AT&T U-verse. advertisement “If you don’t have this area, [our services are] just a list,” Cheng explains. “For this much a month you can do this, or for this much a month you can do that.’” Instead, shoppers can actually sit on a couch, try out fiber-optic cable and beam content to sample phones and tablets that they’re simply handed, completely untethered, to test out and try new techniques. To the skeptic, it’s a lot of empty demo space in a premium retail strip that rents for 450 a square foot. “Our main focus is not sales,” Cheng explains. “Our traditional metrics may not work for here, but we’ll be successful in other ways.” She may be right. It’s in the Experience Platform–this floor space-swallowing digital mise en scene–that you really see AT&T’s plan with its flagship, to sell their current and future services, not as a promise of another new iPhone and faster data, but as platform-agnostic interconnectivity. It’s driving to work. It’s making dinner. It’s digital idealism free from the bounds of any phone, but very closely tied to AT&T itself. So imagine my surprise when I’ve circled the mega boutique store and notice, for the first time, all of AT&T’s actual phones are on display. They’re sitting on a series of tables, splitting the grand room right down the middle–positioned in an obvious yet surely overlooked spot, the physical and metaphorical backbone of the store. Check out more images of AT&T’s Chicago flagship store here. |||||Summary:","completion":"AT&T is opening its first flagship store on Chicago's Michigan Avenue, shifting the retail experience to go beyond selling phones and tablets to showcasing services such as fitness applications and \\"smartcar\\" features.

Movie title: Final Destination 3 Context: High school student Wendy Christensen visits an amusement park with her boyfriend Jason Wise, best friend Carrie Dreyer, and Carrie's boyfriend Kevin Fischer for their senior class field trip. As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the hydraulics securing the seat belts and roller coaster cars will fail, killing everyone on board. When she panics a fight breaks out and several people leave or are forced off the ride, including Kevin; best friends Ashley Fruend and Ashlyn Halperin; alumnus Frankie Cheeks; athlete Lewis Romero; and goths Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. As they leave they witness the roller coaster derail, killing the remaining passengers, including Jason and Carrie, leaving Wendy devastated. The next day, Kevin tells Wendy about the explosion of Flight 180 and the subsequent deaths of the survivors. Believing that Kevin is mocking her, Wendy dismisses his theory and leaves. Later on, Ashley and Ashlyn are killed at a tanning salon when a loosened shelf falls and locks them in the overheating tanning beds. Now convinced that Death is still after them, Wendy and Kevin set out to save the remaining survivors using omens hidden within photos that were taken of them the night of the accident. Frankie dies next at a drive-thru when a runaway truck crashes into the back of Kevin's truck, causing the engine fan to blow out and slice off the back of Frankie's head. The next day, they try to save Lewis at the gym, but he tells them he doesn't believe them shortly before two iron weights from the machine he is using swing down and crush his head. Next, they find Ian and Erin working at a hardware store. Wendy manages to save Ian before he is impaled by falling planks of wood, but a chain reaction causes Erin to fall backwards onto a nail gun, and she is shot repeatedly through the head.

Please write a short summary for the following article: An Enclave With Rustic Charm Douglas Healey for The New York Times RUSTIC POSTCARD In Weston, the overwhelming home style is the stoic white colonial, often set back behind stone walls, like this house on Kettle Creek Road. IT’S not hard to understand why Puritan settlers in Connecticut slapped the Devil’s name on so many ridges, rivers and gorges. These barren areas were probably so difficult to farm or even traverse that they might have seemed cursed. The settlers of Weston, a town in Fairfield County 50 miles from Manhattan, appear to have been similarly motivated in naming Devil’s Den, a section near Redding. Yet although the rolling terrain might once have engendered superstition, it is now embraced as a sprawling 1,720-acre preserve hugely popular with hikers. Early European arrivals were also responsible for many of the 50 or so dams in Weston, which they used to mill grain and lumber. The waterfall from one cascades down the West Branch of the Saugatuck River by the terrace of the Cobb’s Mill Inn, one of the town’s few businesses until its recent closure. There is another waterfall on a stony slope at the corner of Weston and River Roads. A third, resembling a veil, can be seen along Old Redding Road. Picturesque as they are, however, today the dams are viewed as a potential environmental hazard. They present a barrier to the spawning grounds of certain indigenous fish — alewife, for instance, which swim upstream to lay their eggs. As a result, a partnership led by the state Nature Conservancy and made up of officials from Weston and nearby towns, the state Department of Environmental Protection and the local water company has embarked on a mission to remove some of the dams or equip them with fish channels. One of these detours is in Weston, with another planned for Hasen Pond Dam on Lyons Plain Road, which once provided power for the Bradley Edge Tool Company, a maker of axes. Rob Denkin, who recently relocated to Weston from California, appreciates this kind of conservation-mindedness — especially as it has influenced the town to preserve about 5 of its 21 square miles of land as open space. Part of the reason for his move to the East Coast, Mr. Denkin said, was so that his daughter, Sierra, could be closer to her grandparents, who live in nearby Westport. (Sierra got her name from the Sierra Nevada mountains, where her father and mother, Jennifer, fell in love.) He picked Weston over other enclaves because of its generous two-acre zoning. On the West Coast, he treasured his frequent camping trips to other Sierra mountains, near Lake Tahoe, and an overly paved suburb was the last thing he wanted, he said. Yet when Mr. Denkin, a psychologist, first saw his four-bedroom Weston contemporary house up close, he recalls it as having almost too much nature going on. Because the house was in foreclosure and had sat empty for months, the branches of a tree had been left to all but envelop the roof. “I guess I’m crazy, but I was able to see past all of it,” said Mr. Denkin, who paid 430,000 for the property in 2009 and then spent 100,000 to replace cracked tiles and leaking sunroom windows, and remove that errant tree. And the investment seems smart. Last year, while Mr. Denkin prepared for his move back East, he rented out the house, during which time somebody was impressed enough with it to make a 700,000 offer. When there are so many trees in a place removing a few can sometimes be beneficial, particularly if selling the wood can help out poorer members of the community, said Dawn Egan, a resident who heads the nonprofit Weston Warm-Up Fund. The fund defrays heating bills for people who can’t afford to pay them, Ms. Egan said, adding that this winter it dispersed 100,000 in aid to 52 homes. One way the fund raises money is to cut down oak trees on Ms. Egan’s 22-acre property so that they can be sold as firewood, last year netting 8,000. Ms. Egan has sworn off heating oil for her own custom-built 10,000-square-foot Queen Anne-style house, relying instead on eight geothermal wells. They did represent a substantial chunk of the 5.5 million cost of the home, she acknowledged. But putting them in was “the right thing to do, and good for the environment.” Unlike many communities in Fairfield County, Weston lacks a central town green, as its first European residents, who came from nearby Fairfield, generally lived on scattered farms. And change comes slowly. Its population is 10,200 — almost the same as it was a decade ago. Despite its abundance of streams and rivers, the town never was a place of large-scale manufacturing like nearby Georgetown or Danbury. The housing stock reflects its agricultural past: the style of choice is the stoic white colonial, set back behind loose-fitting stone walls, though often outfitted with modern amenities like three-car garages. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article misstated the average tax on a 4,000-square-foot house in Weston. It ranges from about 13,000 to 23,000. It is not 30,000. A previous version of this article misstated the average tax on a 4,000-square-foot house in Weston. It ranges from about 13,000 to 23,000.

The people who first lived there named a section of the town \\"Devil's Den\\" because the land was not good for farming. Today, a big part of the land has been preserved as open space, with lots of trees and trails for people to enjoy. Some of the old dams in the town have been changed to help protect the environment and the fish that live there. The people in Weston care about their community and try to help each other, like helping families who can't pay their heating bills during winter.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You can usually tell that a yarn is chunky just by looking at it. Chunky yarn is only one term used to identify yarn types within the broader \\"bulky yarn\\" category. Many yarn brands will label the yarn as \\"chunky yarn,\\" but there are a few other terms that brands may use to describe the yarn. These terms include \\"craft\\" and \\"rug\\" yarn. Check the label to be sure that a yarn is chunky. Another way to identify chunky yarn is by its yarn weight symbol. The symbol for chunky yarn and all other forms of bulky yarn is \\"5.\\" A thicker yarn category is category 6, which is \\"super bulky.\\" Some yarns in this category might be called \\"super chunky.\\" Super chunky yarn and chunky yarn are not quite the same, so you should keep that in mind when making your yarn selection. Yarns can be made from different fibers, even yarns of a single thickness. Each fiber will have a different texture and appearance. Experiment with different fibers until you find one that you like. As a general tip, consider the intended use of the project when picking out a fiber material. A blanket or scarf will need a softer yarn fiber than a rug or handbag would probably need. Acrylic wool is a mix of natural and synthetic fibers. It tends to be inexpensive and durable, making it ideal for projects like rugs and purses. It can also be used for sweaters and scarves but may not be soft enough for those with sensitive skin. Cotton wool is soft, durable, and natural. It is generally preferred for sweaters and scarves but may still be too rough for those with very sensitive skin, like infants and toddlers. The softest wools are cashmere, silk, mohair, lambs, and alpaca. Cashmere and silk wools are typically used for scarves, shawls, and wraps, but they are more delicate and require more care. Mohair, lambswool, and alpaca wool tend to be used for blankets and sweaters, but they also require special care. This step applies to any yarn you shop for, and chunky yarn is no exception. You'll need to figure out which color or colors you want to use for your project. Use any color that you like or that will meet the needs of your project. Once you figure it out, buy the number of skeins you will need. It's better to have too many than too few. The dye can be slightly different from batch to batch, so buying the same hue by name at two different times can result in having two slightly different shades. You can avoid this problem if you buy the yarn all at once. To be on the safe side, you should also check the \\"lot\\" or \\"dye lot\\" number on the back label of each skein. Make sure that the dye lot number on each skein is the same before you buy them. Otherwise, you may still end up with different shades. The right crochet hook to use can vary by project and yarn type. If you are using a pattern, then the hook size might be indicated in the pattern. If you are not using a pattern, then check the yarn label for a recommendation. If you are not sure what hook size to use, choose a hook size that falls within the standard recommended range. Larger hooks tend to be best for chunky yarn. In U.S. sizes, look for a hook between K-10-1/2 and M-13. In metric sizes, look for a hook between 6.5 and 9 mm. If you end up picking a super chunky yarn, the recommended hook size is M-13 and up in U.S. sizes or 9 mm and up in metric sizes. Summary:","completion":"To identify chunky yarn, look for the label that indicates it as \\"chunky yarn\\" or terms like \\"craft\\" and \\"rug\\" yarn. Check for the yarn weight symbol \\"5\\" on the label. Be mindful of the difference between chunky yarn (category 5) and super chunky yarn (category 6). Experiment with different fibers, keeping in mind the intended use of your project and the softness or durability required. Choose the desired color and make sure to purchase enough skeins of the same dye lot to avoid different shades. For choosing the right crochet hook, consult the pattern or yarn label for recommendations. Typically, chunky yarn works best with larger hooks (U.S. sizes K-10-1/2 to M-13, or metric sizes 6.5 mm to 9 mm). For super chunky yarn, consider even larger hooks (U.S. sizes M-13 and up, or metric sizes 9 mm and up)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By Rebecca English PUBLISHED: 07:44 EST, 29 October 2013 | UPDATED: 19:29 EST, 29 October 2013 It isn't every day that The Queen drives past your front door and the grins on the faces of this excited family were only rivalled by that of the monarch as she cruised through Brixton in her Bentley. Smiling and waving as she rolled through South London, the Queen was spotted by the woman and two children as she rolled past the steps of their home on her way to an inner city riding centre. Joined by daughter-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall, the monarch, still a keen rider herself at 87, was visiting the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre in gang-ridden Brixton. He added: 'I’m really surprised she [the Queen] is coming to","completion":"Brixton, especially considering the challenges this area has faced, but it's a testament to her commitment to supporting local communities and fostering a love for equestrian activities among the younger generation.' The visit was a rare, yet deeply meaningful, event for the residents of Brixton, an area that has long struggled with issues of crime and violence. The presence of the Queen, accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall, demonstrated their willingness to bring attention to and encourage opportunities for youth in underprivileged areas. As the royal entourage approached the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre, a palpable sense of excitement and anticipation filled the air. The facility, which provides recreational and educational activities for disadvantaged children and young people, has become a beacon of hope for the Brixton community. The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall were welcomed by a lively crowd of cheering children and staff members, all eager to demonstrate their equestrian skills and share their personal stories of growth and resilience. Guided by the dedicated staff, the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall toured the facility, taking the time to engage with the eager young riders, asking questions about their experiences at the club and offering words of encouragement. The duo also met with the hardworking volunteers, without whom the club would not be able to operate. They expressed their gratitude for the valuable services provided by the staff and emphasized the importance of supporting community projects such as these. One poignant moment during the visit occurred when a young rider named Kadija, who faced significant personal challenges before joining the club, presented the Queen with an original drawing of a horse she had created as a token of appreciation. Visibly moved by Kadija's gesture, the Queen thanked her and praised her artistic abilities and determination to overcome her struggles. The exchange symbolized the transformative power of community programs like the Ebony Horse Club, which can foster positive change and offer hope to those in need. As the visit concluded, the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall addressed the gathered crowd. The Queen acknowledged the incredible work being done by the Ebony Horse Club staff and reiterated her commitment to supporting similar initiatives throughout the United Kingdom. She also commended the young riders for their dedication and hard work, encouraging them to continue pursuing their passions and to never allow their circumstances to define who they are. The Queen's visit to the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre in Brixton may have been an exceptional day for the institution and the community, but the lasting impact of her presence will undoubtedly resonate with the residents and inspire hope for a brighter future. The determination of the Brixton community and the efforts of the staff and volunteers at the centre serve as a powerful reminder of the critical role that supportive community initiatives play in transforming lives and building a stronger and more unified society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Open a can of tuna.","completion":"Opening a can of tuna may seem like a simple task, but it requires a bit of technique and the right tools to do it safely and efficiently. The following is a detailed, step-by-step guide to help someone go about accomplishing this goal: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials: To open a can of tuna, one would need a can opener (manual or electric), a bowl to empty the contents into, a fork to flake the tuna, and a cloth or paper towel to clean up any spills. 2. Prepare the workspace: Ensure the workspace is clean, stable, and has enough lighting. Place the can, can opener, bowl, fork, and cloth or paper towel within easy reach. 3. Inspect the can: Before opening the can, inspect it for any dents, leaks, or bulging. If the can appears damaged, it may not be safe to consume the contents. In that case, discard the can and use another one. 4. Position the can opener: If using a manual can opener, place the opener on the top of the can, aligning the cutting wheel with the inner edge of the can's lid. For an electric can opener, follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to properly position the can. 5. Begin cutting: For a manual can opener, apply even pressure to the top of the can while turning the handle clockwise. This process will cause the cutting wheel to pierce the lid and begin cutting along the edge. For an electric can opener, the process is similar, but the unit will do the work of cutting while the user holds the can in position. 6. Continue cutting around the edge: Keep turning the handle (or holding the can in position for electric openers) until the cutting wheel has made a full rotation around the entire edge of the can's lid. 7. Carefully lift the lid: Using the can opener's built-in lid lifter or a fork, carefully lift the lid away from the can. Be cautious, as the edge of the lid may be sharp. 8. Drain the liquid: Most cans of tuna have some type of liquid in them, either oil or water. Hold the can over the sink while using the partially detached lid as a strainer to drain the liquid from the can. Press the lid gently against the tuna to squeeze out any excess liquid. 9. Remove the lid completely: Once the liquid has been drained, carefully remove the lid entirely from the can, using a fork or the lid lifter on the can opener. Dispose of the lid safely, being mindful of the sharp edges. 10. Transfer the tuna to a bowl: Using a fork, scoop the tuna out of the can and into the bowl. Flake the tuna apart, if desired. 11. Clean up: Wipe down the workspace with the cloth or paper towel to clean up any spills, and wash the can opener, fork, and any other utensils used. 12. Enjoy your opened can of tuna: The tuna is now ready to be consumed or used for recipes such as sandwiches, salads, or casseroles. Remember, safety is important when using sharp tools like a can opener, so always handle them with care and focus on the task at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is located off the coast of Luzon, and northeast of Palawan. The southern coast of Mindoro forms the northeastern extremum of the Sulu Sea. - Sarawak is one of the two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo (Sabah being the other state). This territory has a certain level of autonomy in administration, immigration, and judiciary. Sarawak is in northwest Borneo, bordering the state of Sabah to the northeast, Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of Borneo, to the south, and the independent state of Brunei in the northwest. The capital city, Kuching, is the economic centre of the state and the seat of the Sarawak state government. Other cities and towns in Sarawak include Miri, Sibu, and Bintulu.

Mount Murud is the highest point in Sarawak. - The Sama-Bajau refers to several Austronesian ethnic groups of Maritime Southeast Asia with their origins from the southern Philippines. The name collectively refers to related people who usually call themselves the Sama or Samah; or are known by the exonyms Bajau (also spelled Badjao, Bajaw, Badjau, Badjaw, Bajo or Bayao) and Samal or Siyamal (the latter being considered offensive). They usually live a seaborne lifestyle, and use small wooden sailing vessels such as the \\"perahu\\" (\\"layag\\" in Meranau), \\"djenging\\", \\"balutu\\", \\"lepa\\", \\"pilang\\", and \\"vinta\\" (or \\"lepa-lepa\\"). Some Sama-Bajau groups native to Sabah are also known for their traditional horse culture. - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions: - A slit drum is a hollow percussion instrument. In spite of the name, it is not a true drum but an idiophone, usually carved or constructed from bamboo or wood into a box with one or more slits in the top. Most slit drums have one slit, though two and three slits (cut into the shape of an \\"H\\") occur. If the resultant tongues are different width or thicknesses, the drum will produce two different pitches. It is used throughout Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. In Africa such drums, strategically situated for optimal acoustic transmission (e.g., along a river or valley), have been used for long-distance communication. - The Agung a Tamlang is a type of Philippine slit drum made of hollowed out bamboo in imitation of the real agung . Pitch is determined by the length and depth of the slit . The agung a tamlang is used as practice for the real agung : players either use either one agung a tamlang ( hold it with one hand and using the other to strike it with a beater ) or using two agung a tamlangs where the other agung is held with one 's feet . - The agung is a set of two wide-rimmed, vertically suspended gongs used by the Maguindanao, Maranao, Sama-Bajau and Tausug people of the Philippines as a supportive instrument in kulintang ensembles. The agung is also ubiquitous among other groups found in Palawan, Panay, Mindoro, Mindanao, Sabah, Sulawesi, Sarawak and Kalimantan as an integral part of the agung orchestra. - Kalimantan is the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo. It comprises 73% of the island's area. The non-Indonesian parts of Borneo are Brunei and East Malaysia. - The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. - Mindanao is the second largest and southernmost major island in the Philippines. It is also the name of one of the three island groups in the country (the other two being Luzon and the Visayas), consisting of the island of Mindanao and smaller outlying islands. Davao City is the largest city in Mindanao. As of the 2010 census, the island's population itself is 20,281,545 people, while the Mindanao island group has 21,968,174 inhabitants.

This territory has a certain level of autonomy in administration, immigration, and judiciary which differentiates it from the Malaysian Peninsula states. Sabah is situated in northern Borneo, bordering the state of Sarawak to the southwest, Kalimantan to the south, while separated by sea from the Federal Territory of Labuan in the west and the Philippines to the north and east. Kota Kinabalu is the capital city as well the economic centre for the state and the seat for the Sabah state government. Other major towns in Sabah include Sandakan and Tawau. As of the 2015 census in Malaysia, the state's population is 3,543,500. Sabah has an equatorial climate with tropical rainforests and abundant animal and plant species. The state has a long mountain ranges in the west side which formed as part of the Crocker Range National Park. Kinabatangan River is the second longest river in Malaysia while Mount Kinabalu is the highest point of Sabah as well for Malaysia. - A gong (from Javanese, Indonesian, Malay: \\"gong\\"; Chinese: ; pinyin: luó) is an African, East and South East Asian musical percussion instrument that takes the form of a flat, circular metal disc which is hit with a mallet.

With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - A percussion instrument is a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater (including attached or enclosed beaters or rattles); struck, scraped or rubbed by hand; or struck against another similar instrument. The percussion family is believed to include the oldest musical instruments, following the human voice. 'agung a tamlang' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'subclass of'?

Does the sentence \\"When North Korea declared its intention to do this the Secretary-General of the United Nations, acting as registrar, said that original signatories of the ICCPR had not overlooked the possibility of explicitly providing for withdrawal, but rather had deliberately intended not to provide for it.\\" answer the question \\"What two factors determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty?\\"","completion":"No, the sentence does not answer the question \\"What two factors determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty?\\". The sentence provided discusses the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and North Korea's declaration of intention, as well as the UN Secretary-General's response about withdrawal provisions. To answer the original question, I need to identify the two factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty. Step 1: Analyze the question. The question asks about two factors that determine the possibility of withdrawing from a treaty. Step 2: Identify the two factors. Based on general knowledge, there are two main factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty: 1. Withdrawal provisions within the treaty: If the treaty itself explicitly includes clauses or provisions that allow for withdrawal under specific conditions, then a party can withdraw in accordance with those provisions. 2. Permissible under customary international law: If the treaty does not have explicit withdrawal provisions, it may still be possible to withdraw if it is permissible under customary international law. Customary international law may allow for withdrawal under certain circumstances, such as a fundamental change in circumstances or a violation of the treaty terms by another party. In conclusion, the two factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty are the withdrawal provisions within the treaty itself and the permissibility under customary international law."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Carey has been put in charge by US group Liberty Media, which is buying a controlling shareholding from CVC. \\"You've got to understand what everybody wants and then find a path,\\" he said. \\"That is not a task for a committee, as they tend to become bureaucratic. But there also can't be a dictatorship, even if probably they are used to it.\\" The remarks, made in an interview on the official F1 website on Carey's visit to last weekend's Singapore Grand Prix, will be interpreted as a reference to the way Bernie Ecclestone has run F1 for the past 40 years. Ecclestone, who is 86 next month, has been kept on by the new owners as chief executive, but there has been no official confirmation of the length of time he will stay. Carey, a long-time lieutenant of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, said: \\"With all credit to Bernie, he's had enormous success - the world admires Bernie for the business that he has built. But I still think that there is another level that we can take Formula 1 to. \\"For the first few months - call it 100 days - it is largely listening and meeting - and digesting. And then come out of that phase with a degree of visions that continue to be shaped. Nothing is ever written in stone. Bernie is the CEO, so Bernie is going to lead it and I will work with Bernie to establish some kind of strategic plan to where you want to go.\\" Ecclestone, who is renowned for his distaste for working with other people and likes to have control in his affairs, told Sky Sports: \\"If, by chance, things aren't going the way I think would be the right way then I will disappear for sure.\\" But he added: \\"There is going to be no problem with Chase. We will work together. He has got expertise that I haven't. We need to be in America. He knows America, he knows television and he can help us a lot.\\" Liberty believes it can expand F1's global reach and revenues by exploiting new avenues. Carey has singled out expansion in the US, Americas and Asia, and a more effective use of digital media. F1 has historically struggled to maintain a consistent presence in the US market, which many have said is a result of Ecclestone's business model of demanding such large fees from circuits for the rights to hold the race that they struggle to establish a workable business plan. Carey said: \\"It is too early to have a clear plan, but we clearly will have a plan to develop America, to be in the right market. \\"There is a big untapped audience in the US. I don't want to criticise the efforts in the past, because I don't know the efforts in the past. \\"Formula 1 is a great premium brand and that means to me that you want to be at a location like Los Angeles, New York or Miami. Ideally in the great cities in the world.\\" Chase said another of his targets was to \\"widen the core television experience to today's needs\\". He added: \\"I believe that a good digital product makes the television product more rewarding. \\"Marketing the sport, in telling the story of the stars and heroes and the incredible machines. Then strengthen it geographically. \\"So there is not 'the cash cow', but there is growth possibility in every area.\\" Summary:","completion":"A man named Carey has been given a big job by a company called Liberty Media. They bought part of another company called CVC. Carey needs to help make a sport called Formula 1 more popular, especially in places like the United States, America, and Asia.
