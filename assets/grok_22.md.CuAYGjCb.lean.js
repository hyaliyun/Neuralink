Question: Ash sent their daughter to the store to get everyone some milk. Given the context: How would Others feel as a result? Possible answers: cared for, very hated, not cared for Answer:","completion":"I will evaluate each possible answer based on the context and choose the most appropriate one. 1. Cared for: Ash sent their daughter to the store to get everyone some milk. This shows that Ash is considering the needs of the people around them and tries to make sure everybody has what they need. Thus, others might feel cared for because Ash is making an effort to provide them with milk. 2. Very hated: There is no indication in the context that Ash's actions would lead to others feeling \\"very hated.\\" Ash is just sending their daughter to the store for milk, which is a common, neutral task. 3. Not cared for: Again, Ash is sending their daughter to get milk for everyone, which indicates that they are considering other's needs. This doesn't imply that others would feel \\"not cared for.\\" Based on the context, my answer is: Answer: cared for It seems that by sending their daughter to the store to get milk for everyone, Ash is showing concern for others' needs, which would likely lead to them feeling cared for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. A:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is as follows: A: The process of respiration begins with inhalation, during which air is drawn into the nasal or oral cavity, depending on whether the person breathes through their nose or mouth. The detailed process is outlined below: 1. Inhalation: The diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, expanding the chest cavity and allowing air to be drawn into the nasal or oral cavity. The nose and mouth act as the initial entry points for air, with the nose responsible for filtering, warming, and humidifying the incoming air. 2. Air enters the trachea: Once air has passed through the nasal or oral cavity, it then moves through the pharynx (throat) and larynx (voice box) and enters the trachea (windpipe). The trachea is responsible for conducting air towards the lungs. 3. Air enters bronchial tubes: The trachea splits into two main bronchi, one entering each lung. Each bronchus further divides into smaller and smaller bronchial tubes within the lungs. 4. Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung: These smaller bronchial tubes eventually narrow down into even smaller tubes called bronchioles. 5. Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs: At the end of the bronchioles, there are clusters of small air sacs called alveoli. 6. Alveoli are surrounded by many small blood vessels: The walls of the alveoli are thin and porous, allowing for efficient gas exchange with the surrounding networks of capillaries (small blood vessels). 7. Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels: As air fills the alveoli, oxygen molecules diffuse across the thin walls of the alveoli and bind to red blood cells within the capillaries. This oxygen-rich blood is then transported away from the lungs towards the heart. 8. Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body: Oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the heart and is pumped out to the rest of the body through the circulatory system to supply oxygen to tissues and cells. 9. Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs: As oxygen is delivered to cells, carbon dioxide—a waste product of cellular respiration—is picked up by red blood cells and transported back to the lungs via the circulatory system. 10. Carbon dioxide is released when you exhale: Upon returning to the lungs, carbon dioxide diffuses across the alveolar walls and into the alveoli. It is then expelled from the body as you exhale, completing the respiratory process."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

I recently discovered that several American products are using harmful additives that are not used – and in some cases banned – in other countries. One of those products is an iconic staple that almost every American, us included, has had at one time or another: Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in the US contains the artificial food dyes Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. These unnecessary – yet potentially harmful - dyes are not in Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in other countries, including the UK, because they were removed due to consumer outcry. Kraft reformulated their product for the UK, but not for their fellow American citizens. It’s time we demand the same here in the US! Note: Yellow 5 (labeled asTartrazine) is also used in these products in Canada, and I'm sure they don't want to have it in their food either! That's why I'm petitioning Kraft to remove all dangerous artificial food dyes from their line of macaroni and cheese. Here are the reasons I'm asking Kraft to remove Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 from their Macaroni and Cheese. Artificial food dyes... - Are man-made in a lab with chemicals derived from petroleum (a crude oil product, which also happens to be used in gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt, and tar). - Require a warning label in other countries outside the US. - Have been banned in countries like Norway and Austria (and are being phased out in the UK). - Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 are contaminated with known carcinogens (a.k.a. an agent directly involved in causing cancer). - Cause an increase in hyperactivity in children. - Have a negative impact on children’s ability to learn. - Have been linked to long-term health problems such as asthma, skin rashes, and migraines. - Add absolutely no nutritional value to the foods we are eating and are solely used for aesthetic purposes only. To prove this last point I personally tested both the US and UK versions of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and found virtually no difference in color or taste (see the video above). I grew up eating this product, and it’s available at almost every grocery store across the country. Everyone deserves the same safer version that our friends get overseas! Kraft Foods is the largest food company headquartered in the United States. If Kraft changes their Macaroni and Cheese, I know this could inspire other food companies across the US to finally eliminate dangerous artificial food dyes once and for all. Join me now and sign this petition. Together we can make a difference. ||||| Kraft says it plans to remove artificial dyes from three macaroni and cheese varieties that come in kid-friendly shapes, a move that comes as people increasingly reach for foods they feel are natural. The change doesn't affect Kraft's plain elbow-shaped macaroni and cheese with \\"original flavor.\\" The packaged-food company, which also makes Oscar Mayer and Jell-O, said the revamped recipes aren't a response to a petition on Change.org that asked it to remove artificial dyes from its famous macaroni and cheese kits. That petition, which was posted in March, had more than 348,000 signatures on Thursday. Kraft's new recipes, which begin shipping early next year, will be for its macaroni and cheese varieties that come in the SpongeBob Squarepants, Halloween and winter shapes. Two new shapes will also be added. The company said it plans to replace the artificial dyes with spices such as paprika for coloring. Ingredients in packaged food have come under greater scrutiny in recent years. People are increasingly trying to eat foods they feel are better for them, and big food makers are adjusting their offerings to keep pace. In the meantime, smaller players such as Annie's Homegrown Inc., which makes a variety of macaroni and cheese, are getting more shelf space at the supermarket. Earlier this year, PepsiCo also said it would remove a controversial ingredient from its Gatorade sports drink because of customer complaints. The move came after a petition by a Mississippi teenager on Change.org, although PepsiCo said the petition wasn't what prompted its decision. Triona Schmelter, Kraft Food Group Inc.'s vice president of marketing for meals, said the company was looking to improve the nutritional profiles of the three macaroni and cheese varieties more broadly. The new recipes will also add whole grains and reduce the amount of sodium and saturated fat, she said. She declined to specify whether Kraft would eventually make similar changes to its other macaroni and cheese lines. But she noted the company already offers options that only use natural colors, such as several of its \\"Homestyle\\" varieties. \\"We'll continue to make improvement where we can,\\" Schmelter said, noting that the company tries to cater to evolving customer preferences. Vani Hari, who started the petition on Change.org and runs the website FoodBabe.com, said she expects Kraft will remove artificial dyes from other products down the road. \\"I knew all along that it wasn't going to be an overnight change,\\" said Hari, who is based in Charlotte, N.C. \\"This is a big corporation, and this is one of their biggest products.\\" ____________ Follow Candice Choi at http://www.twitter.com/candicechoi ||||| A campaign to get the artificial yellow dye out of Kraft's Mac and Cheese claimed a victory today after the company announced its plans to pull the coloring from at least three of its kid-friendly boxes in the United States and Canada. The change doesn't affect Kraft's plain elbow-shaped macaroni and cheese with \\"original flavor,\\" according to the Associated Press. But it will affect its new recipes, which will available next year: SpongeBob SquarePants, Halloween and winter shapes. Two new shapes will also be added. The new natural color will come from spices such as paprika, according to Triona Schmelter, Kraft Food Group Inc.'s vice president of marketing meals. It will also contain more whole grains and less sodium and saturated fat. \\"We'll continue to make improvement where we can,\\" Schmelter told the AP. Moms tell Kraft to take out food dyes. Company officials said, however, their decision was not in response to the petition that was launched on Change.org and has garnered more than 348,000 signatures. Two North Carolina bloggers, Lisa Leake and Vani Hari, launched the petition last March and confronted Kraft executives. Today, only Hari, who blogs at Food Babe, continues the fight. \\"I was so shaken with the news that my body was trembling,\\" she told ABCNews.com today. \\"I have been fighting so hard for these 348,000 people, being their voice.\\" Hari, 34, delivered the signatures to Kraft headquarters last spring and said she \\"continues to keep the pressure on\\" through her writing and getting others to call corporate headquarters and \\"waging a war\\" on Facebook. \\"I have built an army of people concerned about food and not only what their families are eating, but all of America,\\" Hari said. She has been worried about the additives -- yellow dye 5 and yellow dye 6, which she said added nothing to the flavor and may be dangerous to kids' health. Hari did some investigating and found that Kraft makes the same Mac and Cheese for its consumers in the United Kingdom, but because of stricter rules regarding additives, it is dye-free. There, Kraft uses natural beta carotene and paprika to make it almost the same color. She said she was inspired by Missouri teenager Sarah Kavanagh's Change.org petition that pressured Gatorade to stop using brominated vegetable oil and Houston healthy food advocate Bettina Siegal's Change.org petition to take \\"pink slime\\" out of school lunches. 11 Foods Banned Outside the U.S. That We Eat The news from Kraft comes as another mom, Renee Shutters from New York, has launched a petition on Change.org calling on Mars to remove artificial dyes from M&M;'s candy. It has gone viral, with more than 100,000 signatures, just in time for Halloween. Hari and Leake said that the yellow dye serves only \\"aesthetic purposes\\" and worried that food colorings have been associated with hyperactivity in children, allergies, migraine and, because yellow dyes are petroleum-based, maybe cancer. The women taste-tested the two versions of Mac and Cheese and posted it on YouTube. They said they found \\"virtually no difference\\" in color or taste. Leake said her children actually liked the U.K. version better. Leake and Hari say in their petition that in addition to hyperactivity, these dyes can have a \\"negative impact on children's ability to learn.\\" Some countries require warning labels on products that contain color additives, according to Hari, who writes the blog Food Babe. \\"That's the reason why companies are phasing out dyes,\\" she said. In the United States, \\"we have this precautionary principle,\\" she said. \\"We have to go through crazy, rigorous things to prove harm, rather than safety.\\" Both yellow dyes in question are fully legal and approved by the FDA, which is responsible for food safety. More than 3,000 additives are approved for food. \\"Today, food and color additives are more strictly studied, regulated and monitored than at any other time in history,\\" the FDA states on its website about the topic. To market a new food or color additive, a manufacturer or other sponsor must first petition the FDA for its approval. Since 1999, indirect additives have been approved by a pre-market notification process requiring the same data as was previously required by petition. But Leake and Hari cited a 68-page report from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, \\"Food Dyes: A Rainbow of Risks,\\" which outlines various studies on the health effects of food coloring. The center was founded by scientists when consumer and environmental protection awareness was growing in 1971. It advocates for nutrition and health, food safety and alcohol policy. The report was based on government studies from the National Toxicology Program and recommends removing yellow dye 6 from the market. Both dyes used in the Kraft product contain benzidine 4-amino-buphenyl, a man-made product derived from petroleum. In a \\"too brief\\" mouse study, yellow dye 5 showed risks of hyperactivity in children, according to the report; yellow dye 6 was associated with adrenal and testicular tumors and no studies were done in utero. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something.

Information: - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - William Craig ( November 13 , 1918 -- January 13 , 2016 ) was an American academic and philosopher , who taught at the University of California , Berkeley , in Berkeley , California . His research interests included mathematical logic , and the philosophy of science , and he is best known for the Craig interpolation theorem . - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation. - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. - First-order logic also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as \\"Socrates is a man\\" one can have expressions in the form \\"there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man\\" where \\"there exists\\" is a quantifier and \\"X\\" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers. - Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas: - In mathematical logic, Craig's interpolation theorem is a result about the relationship between different logical theories. Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a formula implies a formula , and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a third formula , called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in occurs both in and , implies , and implies . The theorem was first proved for first-order logic by William Craig in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as propositional logic. A stronger form of Craig's theorem for first-order logic was proved by Roger Lyndon in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the CraigLyndon theorem. - Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth. - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also include the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System. - Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy investigating the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it. Metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions: - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - A public university is a university that is predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government, as opposed to private universities. Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape. - Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those. - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\". - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - In mathematics, model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic. The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language. A set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory; a model of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory. - Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague. Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th Century. Metamathematics provides \\"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\\" (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition \\"2+2=4\\" as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition \\"'2+2=4' is valid\\" as belonging to metamathematics. - The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world. - Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering. - Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City.

Can we infer the following? A Member is doing something inherently connected with a \`\`proceeding in Parliament'' when putting down a question on the Order Paper. No-one in Parliament is elected except the speaker.","completion":"The concept of \\"proceedings in Parliament\\" refers to activities that take place within the context of the legislative assembly. This includes various actions such as debating, voting, submitting motions, amendments or bills, and even working internally with parliamentary committees or parliamentary services. The aim of parliamentary proceedings is to ensure that the legislative assembly functions effectively and efficiently through a democratic process. Concerning the first inference, it is accurate to deduce that a Member is doing something inherently connected to a \\"proceeding in Parliament\\" while putting down a question on the Order Paper. An Order Paper is an official agenda that outlines the process of Parliament, including the scheduling of debates, motions, questions, and several other elements relevant to parliamentary activities. By submitting a question on the Order Paper, the Member is participating in the procedures that constitute the ongoing proceedings in Parliament. This contribution adds to the overall structure and function of the legislative assembly which aims to adequately represent the citizens they serve. However, the second part of the inference - \\"No-one in Parliament is elected except the speaker\\" - is incorrect, as it does not take into account the nature of parliamentary democracies. In a parliamentary system, Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected representatives of their constituencies through a democratic process. In most cases, these MPs serve in the legislative assembly, known as Parliament. They may belong to a range of political parties or be independent, and their primary goal is to pass laws and address concerns relevant to their constituents and the nation as a whole. The Speaker of the Parliament is also an elected individual, serving as the impartial presiding officer of the legislative assembly. The Speaker's duty is to maintain order, enforce parliamentary procedural rules, interpret parliamentary laws, and ensure debates and discussions are handled in a fair and unbiased manner. The Speaker is typically elected at the commencement of a new Parliament session or following the retirement or resignation of a sitting Speaker, and it is not uncommon for them to be re-elected if they perform well in their role. In conclusion, the first part of the inference regarding a Member's connection to a \\"proceeding in Parliament\\" when putting down a question on the Order Paper is accurate. However, the second part, claiming that no one is elected aside from the speaker, is incorrect. Instead, Members of Parliament, including the Speaker, are elected representatives who collectively contribute to the proceedings and decision-making processes of the parliamentary system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Bears were penalized on the play and Adams was taken off the field on a stretcher. (Matt Ludtke/AP) The NFL is reviewing the hit delivered by Chicago Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan on Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams during Thursday night’s game at Lambeau Field for potential discipline, possibly a suspension. That review was underway Friday morning. “There have already been discussions …. I don’t have a decision yet on whether discipline will be handed down,” said Joe Lockhart, the NFL’s executive vice president of communications and public affairs. According to the league, Adams suffered a concussion and spent the night in a hospital. [From Freddie Gray through Ray Lewis, Baltimore is at the center of NFL anthem debate] Trevathan was penalized for a helmet-to-helmet hit, delivered as Adams was being tackled by Adrian Amos after a catch. He was not ejected from the game by officials. The league can follow up with a fine or suspension after its review. The NFL enacted a directive by its rulemaking competition committee in the offseason calling for ejections and suspensions for the most egregious of illegal hits, even on a first offense. Lockhart said the league is withholding judgment for now on whether it believes Trevathan should have been ejected. “I want to let the process run its course,” he said. “I will tell you our commitment to this [player-safety measures] is the same as it was yesterday.” Mike Pereira, the NFL’s former vice president of officiating and now a rules analyst for Fox, wrote on Twitter: “That[‘]s the first time I have seen the foul called for hitting the runner with the crown of the helmet. I would eject him now.” Dean Blandino, the other former NFL officiating chief who now works for Fox, wrote on Twitter that he “won’t be surprised” if Trevathan is suspended. [From March: NFL enacting proposal for ejections, suspensions for certain illegal hits] The NFL suspended Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, a repeat offender, for an illegal hit during the preseason. Burfict’s suspension originally was for five games but was reduced to three on appeal. Players on the field immediately waved for the medical staff to come out to assist Adams. Adams gave a thumbs-up signal before leaving the field. He was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation and the Packers said later that he was conscious and had movement in his extremities.

Packers, Bears and some Green Bay fans link arms after Trump continues attacks on NFL players ||||| As Packers receiver Davante Adams lay motionless on the Lambeau Field grass late Thursday night, Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan felt both concerned and remorseful. It was Trevathan’s hit — a crushing helmet-to-helmet shot at the end of an 8-yard reception — that sent Adams’ mouthpiece flying and temporarily knocked the receiver out. A worried silence enveloped Lambeau Field as medical personnel rushed to Adams’ aid and eventually took him off the field on a stretcher. The Packers receiver was immediately transported to a local hospital to undergo testing for head and neck injuries. He was conscious and had movement in his extremities as he left the stadium, the Packers said. Still, Trevathan felt his worry spike when he saw Adams on the ground. The Bears linebacker said he didn’t realize immediately how vicious his hit had been. “I realized it once he laid there for a while,” Trevathan said. “I saw his mouthpiece over there on the other side and he wasn’t moving and I saw his fingers twitching. I knew it wasn’t good. I just immediately dropped down and started praying.” Replays of Trevathan’s hit proved jarring. As safety Adrian Amos held Adams up near the Bears 10-yard line, Trevathan came from away from the play and blasted the Packers receiver. The crown of Trevathan’s helmet smashed into Adams’ head. The hit left a stain on the Bears’ 35-14 loss and triggered an impassioned debate on whether the blow had been dirty or not. “I was just trying to make a play,” Trevathan asserted. “It wasn’t intentional. I was just trying to hustle to the ball and do my job. Unfortunately, he wound up hurt. I’m sorry about that. And I’m going to reach out to him and try to send him a message. We play a physical game. But you never wish that on anybody.” Trevathan was asked after the game whether he regretted the hit after seeing it on replay. “I regret just the level I hit him at,” he said. “I could have been a little better. But you have to understand I was (gathering) momentum and I was just trying to make a play. Nothing intentional. It happens in this game.” Trevathan will undoubtedly face a stiff fine from the league office for the hit. And there will be serious discussions about a possible suspension, a scenario Trevathan was bracing for late Thursday. >> Analysis: Danny Trevathan's hit on Davante Adams shows NFL needs college football's targeting rule “We’ll see,” he said. “I don’t think it should be a suspension. But you never know. I’m going to send a prayer out. My main concern is that he’s OK. ... It was bad. I never wish that on anybody. Especially after being hurt (myself) a few times, I know how that is. And especially with the head and the neck, you never wish that on anybody. You never want to see that.” The Bears linebacker said he planned to reach out to Adams through Twitter and through Packers receiver Randall Cobb, a college teammate of Trevathan’s at Kentucky. “He knows what type of player I am,” Trevathan said. “I don’t wish bad on anybody. But I’m going to play lights out and I’m trying to create havoc as a linebacker. But I don’t wish that on anybody.” Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers took exception to Bears players celebrating the hit on Adams initially. Rodgers also spoke at length with Trevathan on the field. “I trust when Danny said that he wasn’t trying to him like that,” Rodgers said. “He is one of the hardest hitting players in the NFL. ... I don’t think he was intentionally trying to hurt (Davante). But he did give him a good whack and unfortunately ‘Te got knocked out.” Packers safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix took greater exception. “When you see a defenseless guy and he takes a hit by a guy who is running full speed, it’s sad,” Clinton-Dix said. “We play the game for a living and we don’t want a guy to go out like that.” Trevathan was flagged for unnecessary roughness but not ejected after the hit. Referee John Hussey explained that decision. “From my perspective,” Hussey said, “I just didn’t see enough to have it rise to that level. That issue I would say is a judgment call. Was it egregious? Was it completely unnecessary? I didn’t have enough information from my perspective to make it that.” Trevathan had support from his own team at the end of the night. “I know it wasn’t (dirty). I saw it,” defensive end Akiem Hicks said. “I told Danny, ‘You were just playing football. You were trying to make noise and bang pads and stuff that we’re asked to do.’ I know there was no malicious intent behind it. He was just playing the game he’s been playing since he was a young man.” Added Bears coach John Fox: “None of this is intentional. You never want to see any (player) hurt – yours or theirs. None of these guys are out there trying to hurt each other. It is a physical game. I didn’t see it that close. From what I’ve heard, (Adams) is hopefully going to be OK.” dwiederer@chicagotribune.com Twitter @danwiederer ||||| Green Bay Packers' Davante Adams is hit by Chicago Bears' Adrian Amos and Danny Trevathan during the second half of an NFL football game Thursday, Sept. 28, 2017, in Green Bay, Wis. The Bears were penalized... (Associated Press) GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Two more key players hurt. A starting cornerback benched. The Green Bay Packers even had to weather a lightning storm delay. But they just keep finding ways to win. Aaron Rodgers threw four short touchdown passes, and the injury-riddled Packers converted three of Bears quarterback Mike Glennon's four turnovers into scores in an eventful 35-14 victory over mistake-prone Chicago on Thursday night. Rodgers connected with Davante Adams and Randall Cobb on short touchdown passes to help build a 21-0 lead in the second quarter of a game delayed 45 minutes by lightning between the first two periods. The Packers overpowered the Bears down the stretch to slog out a win as intermittent rain fell at Lambeau Field. \\"This was a big character win for us,\\" Rodgers said. The already-depleted Packers (3-1) lost starting running back Ty Montgomery to a rib injury in the first quarter. Adams left the field on a stretcher after getting hit in the head during a tackle by Danny Trevathan in the third quarter. The game was delayed for about 5 minutes while medical personnel tended to the receiver, who gave a thumbs-up signal as he was wheeled off the field. The Packers said Adams was conscious and taken to a hospital for evaluation for possible head and neck injuries, and that he had feeling in all of his extremities. \\"The news I was given on Davante — everything looks positive. That's a great sign,\\" McCarthy said. Known as a hard hitter, Trevathan said the hit wasn't intentional. He was whistled for unnecessary roughness. \\"I'm sorry about that and you know I'm going to reach out to him and try to send him a message,\\" Trevathan said, \\"because you know you play a physical game, but you never wish that on nobody.\\" Other notes and takeaways from the game: BEARS QB: With two fumbles and two interceptions, Glennon did little to quiet the calls from Bears fans to give No. 2 overall pick Mitchell Trubisky a try at quarterback. Glennon did finish 21 of 33 for 218 yards, but the Bears never recovered from his awful start. He fumbled on his first snap on a strip sack by linebacker Clay Matthews. The Bears next play on Oct. 9 against Minnesota. \\"We'll evaluate everything and we've got a lot of work to do before we line up against Minnesota,\\" Fox said. \\"We're going to look at everything.\\" PACKERS OL: The Packers' patchwork offensive line held up well and allowed just two sacks. That was impressive given that Green Bay essentially fielded a starting five of four guards and center Corey Linsley. Lane Taylor, normally a left guard, made his first start at left tackle with David Bakhtiari (hamstring) sidelined. Right tackle Bryan Bulaga (ankle) also missed the game. Rodgers was 18 of 26 for 179 yards. BENCHED: Packers starting cornerback Damarious Randall was benched in the second half for an undisclosed issue. He barely moved on the Bears' opening series after halftime, his arms outstretched at each side while sitting on the sideline. McCarthy said it was an \\"internal matter and we're working through it.\\" At one point, cornerback Davon House, who was not active because of a quad injury, sat down next to Randall on the bench. \\"Just to shake it off, it's all part of the game as a cornerback,\\" House said about his message to Randall. NATIONAL ANTHEM: Players, coaches and other staffers on each team locked arms on their respective sidelines during the national anthem. Packers players released a statement this week saying they would intertwine arms before the game as a show of unity. They asked fans to join in the stands and at home, though it didn't appear that many fans locked arms. Many people in the crowd held up small flags during and after the anthem. Rodgers said he was proud of his team, and that that issue was a \\"galvanizing situation\\" for the locker room. \\"We could hear some USA chants as it started, which is fantastic. Could also hear some negativity being yelled during the anthem,\\" Rodgers said. \\"What's disrespectful to the anthem? Yelling things during it, or standing at attention with arms locked, facing the flag? That's for you to decide.\\" MILESTONES: The Packers are 95-94-6 against the Bears, their first lead in the series since 1933. It's the oldest rivalry in football, dating to 1923. ... Matthews' sack on Glennon in the first quarter was the 75th of his career, breaking the franchise record since 1982 held by Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila. ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL ||||| But it was a scary moment the league will notice GREEN BAY – This was good to hear. “The news I’ve been given on Davante so far is everything looks positive,” Head Coach Mike McCarthy said of receiver Davante Adams , who was taken off Lambeau Field on a stretcher after a nasty hit from Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan. “He’s already giving them a hard time at the hospital to get out of there, so that’s a great sign.” It sure is, and it makes it easier to celebrate the Packers’ 35-14 victory Thursday night knowing Adams apparently is going to be OK. It didn’t look that way when Trevathan lowered the boom on Adams in the red zone. With his momentum stopped by other Bears defenders after a short reception, Adams absorbed a powerful helmet-to-helmet blow from Trevathan that sent Adams’ mouthguard flying and briefly knocked him out. Teammates Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson were immediately, and frantically, waving medical personnel onto the field to tend to Adams. The loudest noise in the press box all night came from the gasps and groans when the replay was shown. Adams was taken to a local hospital to be evaluated for head and neck injuries, but he was conscious with feeling and movement in all his extremities when he left the field. “It’s really tough to see your teammate not able to move,” quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. “You could tell he was in a bad place, in a bad way. “That’s never easy, whether it’s a guy like Malachi (Dupre), who you spend only a few weeks with, or a guy like Nick Collins who you win a Super Bowl with and you’re drafted in the same class. It’s tough.” Rodgers exchanged harsh words with some of the Bears on the field afterward, saying he didn’t like to see any celebrating when a player is carted off. He gave Trevathan the benefit of the doubt, though, after hearing how the linebacker was pleading his case with the officials. “I trust when Danny said he wasn’t intentionally trying to hit him like that,” Rodgers said. “He is one of the hardest-hitting players in the NFL. He made a hit on one of our guys last year in the hole that was one of the hardest hits I’ve ever heard. “But I don’t think he was intentionally trying to hurt ’Tae.” Nelson didn’t attack Trevathan, either. He only wished the play had been whistled dead sooner, because forward progress was clearly stopped. One play after Adams was wheeled off, Nelson caught his second touchdown of the game and went to a knee in the end zone. “That definitely was for ’Tae,” Nelson said. “Obviously, we said some prayers while he was laying there. Just another opportunity to do it. It’s not fun to see your brother laying there motionless like that, and being that close is scary.” For his part, Trevathan told reporters after the game he wasn’t intentionally trying to hit Adams the way he did. He said he planned to reach out to Adams and send him a message. “You never wish that on nobody,” Trevathan said. “My main concern is that he’s OK.” His words won’t stop him from getting fined and possibly suspended, though. A new rule allows for suspensions for first offenses on egregious hits, so how the NFL reacts to Trevathan’s hit will be watched closely, especially after he led with the crown of his helmet. The only punishment administered on the field was a personal foul, which ended up costing the Bears just four yards, half the distance to the goal at the time. One look at the replay had many observers wondering how Trevathan wasn’t ejected from the game. The giant disparity in those thoughts raises the question whether the NFL will sometime soon adopt a “targeting” rule for immediate ejections like in college, or at least make significant player-safety violations subject to on-the-spot replay review. Instead, players, coaches and fans alike will wait perhaps days for a disciplinary ruling on a hit that made everybody cringe in an instant. Adams may get home from the hospital sooner than expected, but the hit he took will have a longer shelf life. How long could depend on just how badly the NFL wants those hits out of the game. McCarthy said conversations about possible rule changes are for the offseason. If those talks indeed take place next spring, Trevathan’s hit will almost certainly be at the center of the discussions. Complete game coverage: ||||| The NFL has a new tool to suspend Chicago Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan for the brutal hit he put on Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams on Thursday night. If it isn't used in this instance, then it's fair to wonder when it ever will be used. During the offseason, the NFL competition committee announced that certain illegal hits, previously punishable by a 15-yard penalty, would be subject to immediate ejection and/or suspension on first offense. At the time, NFL executive vice president Troy Vincent said the league wants to eliminate hits that he termed \\"catastrophic\\" by employing the maximum level of deterrence. It's hard to find a better word to describe what Trevathan did in the third quarter Thursday night. Multiple Bears defenders had Adams wrapped up inside the red zone when Trevathan lowered his head and hit the front of Adams' face hard enough to send his mouthpiece flying. It was both an illegal hit and an exceptionally dirty one, considering Adams was no longer making forward progress. Danny Trevathan's hit to the helmet of Davante Adams didn't get him ejected Thursday night, but stronger punishment could be coming for the Bears linebacker. AP Photo/Matt Ludtke Packers players immediately called for medical assistance as Adams lay motionless on the field. (The team later reported that Adams was conscious and had movement in all extremities en route to a hospital.) Referee John Hussey issued a 15-yard penalty for what he called a \\"hit to the head.\\" More specifically, he probably meant an illegal hit with the crown of the helmet. Regardless, Hussey should receive strong NFL scrutiny for his failure to eject Trevathan on the spot. The NFL has no rule mandating an ejection in those circumstances, but it gives referees the discretion to do so when a \\"flagrant\\" foul occurs. In Week 1, for example, referee John Parry ejected Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane because he thought Lane had thrown a punch. In the NFL rule book, \\"flagrant\\" is defined as \\"extremely objectionable, conspicuous, unnecessary, avoidable or gratuitous.\\" Thursday's dark episode is precisely what the NFL was trying to address with its offseason initiative. I would be stunned if Trevathan is eligible to play in the Bears' next game, scheduled for Oct. 9 against the Minnesota Vikings. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Movie plot: The film opens with a woman walking her dog down an empty, darkened city street. As she passes by a manhole, she is attacked by a creature, and the dog is pulled in after her. George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \\"undergrounders\\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \\"The Reverend\\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved (and eaten), and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and an unexpected visitor that comes up through the sewer access point that she unfortunately decides to open in the basement of her apartment building.

Information: - The Democratic Alliance (AD), originally called Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), was a French political party (19011978) created in 1901 by followers of Léon Gambetta, such as Raymond Poincaré who would be president of the Council in the 1920s. The party was at first conceived by members of the Radical-Socialist Party tied to the business world who united themselves in May 1901, along with many moderates, as gathering center-left liberals and \\"Opportunist\\" Republicans (Gambetta, etc.). However, after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists, it quickly became the main center-right party of the Third Republic. It was part of the National Bloc right-wing coalition which won the elections after the end of the war. The ARD successively took the name \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique\\" (Democratic Republican Party, PRD) then \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique et Social\\" (\\"Social and Republican Democratic Party\\"), before becoming again the AD. - Léon Gambetta (2 April 1838 31 December 1882) was a French statesman, prominent during and after the Franco-Prussian War. - The Democratic and Social Action ( French : Action démocratique et sociale , ADS ) was a French parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies of France during the French Third Republic between 1928 and 1932 . The group was formed by the right - wing ( bourgeois and industrialist wing according to André Siegfried ) of the Democratic Republican Alliance , later Democratic Alliance . A number of ADS deputies were formerly members of the most left - wing faction of the Republican Federation , the main conservative party in France which they had left due to the Federation 's evolution to the right . The ADS was resurrected in 1949 by members of the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance ( UDSR ) who joined the Gaullist Rally of the French People ( RPF ) . - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - André Siegfried (April 21, 1875 March 28, 1959) was a French academic, geographer and political writer best known for his commentaries on American, Canadian, and British politics. - The Republican Federation (FR) was the largest conservative party during the French Third Republic, gathering together the liberal Orleanists rallied to the Republic. Founded in November 1903, it competed with the more secular and centrist \\"Alliance démocratique\\" (Democratic Alliance). Later, most deputies of the \\"Fédération républicaine\\" and of \\"Action libérale\\" (which included Catholics rallied to the Republic) joined the \\"Entente républicaine démocratique\\" right-wing parliamentary group. - Vichy (is a city in the Allier department of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in central France, in the historic province of Bourbonnais. - Raymond Nicolas Landry Poincaré (20 August 1860 15 October 1934) was a French statesman who served three times as Prime Minister of France, and as President of France from 1913 to 1920. He was a conservative leader, primarily committed to political and social stability. - The French Third Republic (sometimes written as \\"\\") was the system of government adopted in France from 1870, when the Second French Empire collapsed, until 1940, when France's defeat by Nazi Germany in World War II led to the formation of the Vichy government in France. It came to an end on 10 July 1940. - The Second French Empire was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France.

I am disappointed to report that Wasabi offered sub-par sushi and even worse cooked items. My judgement of a sushi restaurant's quality of sushi comes in the tasting of two different types of nigiri. The first always being tamago as it is the piece with the lowest payoff for a sushi restaurant (if they take pride in their sushi, they will do the tamago correctly). The second is going to be a well textured, but very delicate cut of fish (on this day it was halibut). The tamago was presented fallen over and was overly sweet with a \\"frozen\\" taste to it. The halibut was not even prepared correctly, there was no grated yuzu (I may be asking for too much at this point) and no salt on the on the fish (you do not use soy sauce for a fish like halibut). The fish itself did not have a clean flavor and an off-putting texture. Finally, the most unforgiving of sins against sushi that Wasabi commits is their packing of sushi. Sushi rice is not to be packed so tight as you are supposed to dip the sushi FISH SIDE DOWN. I am sorry to say that grocery store sushi is better than the offerings here. We then had the calamari appetizer. I don't even know where to begin here. Calamari should not be like onion rings (in other words, the batter should not fall off of the squid like an onion ring. Utterly disappointing. Finally, we ended with the unagi dinner. The fillets of eel were obviously pre-frozen/pre-cooked, drenched in eel sauce, served atop a bed of rice that could feed a family of five, and also contained bones. The side to this dish was not the usual fresh or pickled vegetables that one would find traditionally used to cut the richness of properly prepared unagi, but was instead limp and bitter sauteed cabbage. All in all, this was a very disappointing meal and I would be embarrassed to serve this food and call it \\"Japanese.\\" I rarely ever give out 1 star, but usually 1-star reviews go to venues that have rats and cockroaches.

The Navarrese Civil War of 1451-1455 pitted John II of the Kingdom of Navarre against his son and heir-apparent, Charles IV. When the war started, John II had been King of Navarre since 1425 through his first wife, Blanche I of Navarre, who had married him in 1420. By the marriage pact of 1419, John and Blanche's eldest son was to succeed to Navarre on Blanche's death. When Blanche died in 1441, John retained the government of her lands and dispossessed his own eldest son, Charles , who was made Prince of Viana in 1423. John tried to assuage his son with the lieutenancy of Navarre, but his son's French upbringing and French allies, the Beaumonteses, brought the two into conflict. John was supported by the Agramonteses. From 1451 to 1455, they were engaged in open warfare in Navarre.

Title: The Prophecy 3: The Ascent Movie plot: Danyael Rosales, a street preacher who thinks God doesn't care about anyone because of the death of his parents Valerie Rosales and the angel Danyael from the previous film. He is then forced to face his destiny. As a Nephilim, he has some of the angels' abilities, such as regeneration, and can only be killed if his heart is removed. One night, a blind assassin shoots Danyael as he preaches before a crowd, but the assassin is driven off before he can take out Danyael's heart. As punishment for his failure, Zophael kills the assassin and starts going after Danyael himself with an extendable bladed weapon (the blade can be turned into a three-pronged hook) with which he plans to use to remove Danyael's heart, killing him for good. However, Danyael is protected by Gabriel, a now-human fallen angel who killed Danyael's father and performed many misdeeds. After being defeated by Danyael's mother, Gabriel was turned into a human as punishment. He has spent eighteen years as a human, and realized how wrong he was in the past so has now switched sides.Zophael manages to convince Danyael's girlfriend Maggie to work with him on killing Danyael, but she realizes she's on the wrong side and tries to shoot the angel. It has little effect on Zophael, and he tells her what he is. Frightened, Maggie agrees to help him, and the two catch up to Danyael on a Native American reservation, where he is going to confront Pyriel, another angel who wants to overthrow God. Danyael briefly meets Mary, a Native American woman (first introduced as a child in the first film). Mary informs Danyael that she dreamed of his coming, and that she believes he will be victorious against Pyriel. After parting from Mary, Danyael is attacked by Zophael, crashing Maggie's truck and badly injuring her. He then faces off against Danyael in battle, and seemingly defeats him by impaling his chest with a motorcycle tailpipe, but the angel gets back up and uses his weapon to impale Danyael from behind.

His parents divorced when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: \\"He would walk me to school every single day. He would talk to me about dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me.\\" In 2006, Kapoor played opposite Kareena Kapoor in two films--the thriller 36 China Town and the comedy Chup Chup Ke. In 36 China Town, a murder mystery from the director duo Abbas-Mustan, Kapoor starred as one of the seven suspects in the murder of an heiress, and in the Priyadarshan-directed Chup Chup Ke, he played a depressed man who pretends to be deaf and mute. The former was his first commercial success since Ishq Vishk. Greater success came to Kapoor later that year when he starred alongside Amrita Rao in Sooraj Barjatya's romantic drama Vivah, a film depicting an arranged marriage. Made on a shoestring budget of Rs100 million (US1.5 million), the film earned over Rs530 million (US8.1 million) worldwide, and proved to be Kapoor's highest-grossing film to that point. Reviews of the film, however, were negative; Raja Sen termed the film a \\"nightmare\\" and wrote that Kapoor \\"isn't offensively bad, doesn't ham it up like crazy, or speak in a weird accent. Having said that, he isn't an actor at all, standing around working on his boyish grin, simply chewing up the scenery. No screen presence at all.\\" Kapoor found no success in his first release of 2007--the ensemble comedy Fool & Final. However, his second release that year, the Imtiaz Ali-directed romantic comedy Jab We Met proved to be one of the top-grossing films of the year. The film tells the story of a troubled businessman (Kapoor) whose life undergoes a series of changes after he encounters a loquacious girl (Kareena Kapoor) on a train ride. Ali thought that Kapoor's previous roles failed to justify his acting potential, and thus approached him to portray a more complex character. The BBC noted on how \\"endearing\\" he was in the film and Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote that he left an \\"indelible impression with a performance that is understated and mature\\" in a film he thought primarily belonged to Kareena Kapoor. For his performance, Kapoor received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. After featuring opposite Vidya Balan in the romantic comedy Kismat Konnection (2008), Kapoor played twin brothers, one with a lisp and the other with a stutter, in Vishal Bhardwaj's critically acclaimed caper thriller Kaminey (2009). In preparation, Kapoor met speech specialists and researched on the medical and mental aspects of the two conditions. To create a lean physique for one of the brothers, a look he considered to be \\"radically different\\" from his personal appearance, Kapoor practiced functional training and followed a rigorous diet. Writing for Variety, critic Joe Leydon reviewed that Kapoor \\"impressively displays sufficiently variegated degrees of emotional intensity to sustain the illusion of two distinct characters. Just as important, he provides each sibling an appropriately elevated hunkiness quotient.\\" Rediff.com listed Kapoor's performance as the best by a Bollywood actor in 2009 and he received a second Best Actor nomination at Filmfare. Kaminey earned over Rs700 million (US11 million) worldwide. Kapoor's final release of 2009 was as a cricketer in Dil Bole Hadippa!, a romantic comedy co-starring Rani Mukerji.

Movie plot title: Primal Fear Movie plot: Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a Chicago defense attorney who loves the public spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-profile clients acquitted on legal technicalities. One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell.

Invitation for Coffee: The conversation begins with Kate asking Jim to grab a coffee with her, indicating that she is willing and eager to spend some time with Jim in a casual, chilled-out setting such as a coffee house. This proposal shows her desire for shared, relaxed social activity. To delve further, this could either be an impromptu casual plan or part of a regular meet-up ritual they follow. 2. Jim's Current Engagement: Jim's reply, \\"lecture\\", indicates that he currently is engaged in an activity and is unable to accept Kate's invitation at the present moment. The term suggests that he is likely in an educational setup or perhaps at a conference where he is listening to a lecture. This could also suggest a professional obligation to attend the said lecture, or simply a commitment to personal growth and learning. 3. Availability: Jim then indicates when he will be free to meet with Kate, which is \\"in 30 min\\". This shows his willingness to meet Kate despite the ongoing commitment. By proactively sharing his availability, he is demonstrating interest in complying with Kate's initial proposal once his current engagement ends, thus giving a practical timeframe for the plan. 4.

The city was founded in 43 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus. It served as the capital of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis and was an important city in the western half of the Roman Empire for centuries. Two emperors, Claudius and Caracalla, were born in Lugdunum. In the time period 69192 AD the city population could be as large as 50,000 to 100,000. Even figures of up to 200,000 people are proposed by Albert Grenier. - Claudius (1 August 10 BC 13 October 54 AD) was Roman emperor from 41 to 54. A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was the son of Drusus and Antonia Minor. He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul, the first Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37. - Plautia Urgulanilla ( fl . 1st century ) was the first wife of the future Roman Emperor Claudius . They married sometime around the year 9 CE , when Claudius was 18 years old . According to Suetonius , Claudius divorced her in 24 on grounds of adultery by Plautia and his suspicions of her involvement in the murder of her sister - in - law Apronia . - Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, commonly known as Suetonius (c. 69 after 122 AD), was a Roman historian belonging to the equestrian order who wrote during the early Imperial era of the Roman Empire. - The term Julio-Claudian dynasty refers to the first five Roman emperorsAugustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Neroor the family to which they belonged. They ruled the Roman Empire from its formation under Augustus in the second half of the 1st century (44/31/27) BC, until AD 68 when the last of the line, Nero, committed suicide. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Caligula, properly Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (31 August AD 12 24 January AD 41) was Roman emperor from AD 3741. Born Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus (not to be confused with Julius Caesar), Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Caligula's biological father was Germanicus, and he was the great-nephew and adopted son of Emperor Tiberius. The young Gaius earned the nickname \\"Caligula\\" (meaning \\"little soldier's boot\\", the diminutive form of \\"caliga\\", hob-nailed military boot) from his father's soldiers while accompanying him during his campaigns in Germania. - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - The Pontifex Maximus (Latin, literally: \\"greatest pontiff\\" or \\"greatest bridge-builder\\") was the high priest of the College of Pontiffs (\\"Collegium Pontificum\\") in ancient Rome. This was the most important position in the ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 254 BC, when a plebeian first occupied this post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. Its last use with reference to the emperors is in inscriptions of Gratian (reigned 375383) who, however, then decided to omit the words \\"pontifex maximus\\" from his title. Although the most influential office within Roman priesthood, the \\"pontifex maximus\\" was ranked the fifth in the ranking of the highest Roman priests (\\"ordo sacerdotum\\"), behind the \\"rex sacrorum\\" and the \\"flamines maiores\\" (\\"Flamen Dialis\\", \\"Flamen Martialis\\", \\"Flamen Quirinalis\\"). - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - Augustus (23 September 63 BC 19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. - Adultery (anglicised from Latin \\"adulterium\\") is extramarital sex that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Though what sexual activities constitute adultery varies, as well as the social, religious and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Islam, Christianity and Judaism. A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an affair.

The book is recognized as a blend of science fiction, mystery, and thriller genres, which could be the perfect combination for readers who enjoy all three. Although the reviewer does not agree entirely with the final plot twist, this is usually a subjective matter and may be appreciated by other readers. Moreover, the unsatisfied plot twist was not sufficient to result in a low rating; the reviewer still rates the book at 4 and half stars out of 5. While there are a few criticisms, they do not dominate the review and seem to be outweighed by the reviewer’s praise.

Sanders and Clinton Compete for Young Latino Votes Angel Fernandez, an undocumented 20-year-old born in Mexico, did not drive five hours from Phoenix to Las Vegas to campaign for Bernie Sanders just because the two share an opinion about immigration reform. Fernandez, whose undocumented mother once worked as a landscaper in Phoenix’s intense summer heat and was nearly deported, could have been the textbook single-issue immigration voter. But walking through Sin City’s outskirts on a windy Thursday afternoon, Fernandez balked at the idea of being just an immigration activist. He said he is supporting Sanders more for, well, everything. This election, Fernandez said, is a referendum on the status quo—not just the immigration system. “Whether it be climate change, immigration, black lives or gun control, all of this is intertwined,” Fernandez said, canvassing clipboard in hand. “There are some very powerful people in this country and they’re pulling the strings on all of it. Once you get to the root of the problem, all of these roots will fall.” Fernandez is one of many young Americans who are rejecting identity politics in favor a wider lens. Criminal injustice, corruption, unequal pay for women and even climate change are faces on the same die, politically conscious millennials say. It is impossible to view issues as separate, they say—and in doing so, they are upsetting the usual logic of campaigns. It is a rebuke to the traditional mode of winning elections, in which candidates tailor their message to isolated groups, with promises given like obligatory favors: immigration reform for Latinos, equal pay for women, criminal justice reform for African Americans, legal protections for members of the LGBT community. As Sanders and Hillary Clinton spent a final day on Friday fighting for Nevada’s large Latino population in advance of Saturday’s caucus, that shifting ground was apparent as young voters in the audiences demanded much more than an answer on immigration. “Our parents’ generation thought about immigration like, ‘once this gets fixed, something else gets fixed,'” said Sandra Gamez, a 24-year-old Clinton supporter and DREAMer. “Our generation understands that all these different issues are intersecting and come as part of an intersectional identity.” A canvasser for Sanders, Maria Castro, said she is a “multifaceted” voter.“I am a U.S. citizen that has an undocumented mother. That also cares about student debt, that cares about climate change, that cares about living wages, that cares about black lives. I care about all these issues,” said Castro, 22, on Thursday outside a Sanders campaign office in Las Vegas that shares a building with a Spanish-speaking tax accountant. “I’m not just a one-issue person.” Nevada, the first contest where a significant portion of voters are Latino, is a curtain-raiser that will presage how successfully Clinton and Sanders appeal to Latino voters in the race to come. Latinos were 15% of caucusgoers in the state in 2008, and the numbers are likely to be higher this year. And Latinos will be an increasingly crucial part of the electorate in 2016 for Democrats. They voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in 2012 and the Republican Party has done little to win their support in this election cycle. Donald Trump’s rhetoric about deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants and building a “beautiful wall” at the Mexican border has pulled the entire field of Republican candidates to the right and alienated many. Sanders, who has been criticized as sputtering and tone-deaf on race issues, may be surprisingly well-positioned to capture young Latinos looking for a bigger message. When he speaks to a Latino audience, the Vermont senator mostly delivers the same rote lines about bringing undocumented immigrants out of the shadows but then returns to his usual themes: political corruption, corporate influence, income inequality and social injustice. “All of these things that young people are experiencing, that the Latino community is disproportionately experiencing, it’s all under this umbrella that [the system] is broken and not working for the everyday person,” said Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state legislator who is running for Congress and has backed Sanders. “Sen. Sanders manages to bring all of that together for people.” Clinton has hewed closer to the familiar political playbook. She began in the first month of her campaign with a roundtable of DREAMers in early May, promising comprehensive immigration reform. She has drafted Latino surrogates to criticize Sanders and pick through his record. She wields a rudimentary Spanish when it is useful. “You know, I was the first person to call out Donald Trump,” Clinton said at the MSNBC/Telemundo town hall also on Thursday in Las Vegas. “’Basta, enough!’ I said, ‘Basta!’ enough of this prejudice and paranoia and the kind of language that he uses.” Clinton repeatedly attacks Sanders for his opposition to the 2007 immigration reform legislation introduced by Sen. Ted Kennedy, a precursor to the failed effort in 2013 and one that had extensive, though lukewarm, Latino support. Her criticism—as well as opposition from Rep. Xavier Becerra of California and Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, two Clinton supporters—has put Sanders on the defensive. Clinton’s super PAC points out that Sanders said in a 2007 television interview that he opposed the immigration bill because the extensive guest worker program would drive down wages for Americans. But he now justifies his vote by pointing to the guest worker program’s potential abuse of migrant workers, which the Southern Poverty Law Center called “akin to slavery.” “I voted against the legislation in 2007 in agreement with groups like LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations, in agreement with the AFL-CIO, for a number of reasons,” Sanders said in the town hall on Thursday in Las Vegas. Sanders, though, can seem wooden when addressing Latinos concerned about immigration reform. When a woman asked Sanders at the Thursday town hall when he would take action to end rules barring undocumented immigrants from returning to the U.S. for 10 years, he seemed to hedge. “That I can’t tell you,” he said. When pressed by a moderator, Sanders said touchily, “I’m not a dictator here. It has to do with a little bit of cooperation from the Congress.” And Clinton’s efforts to court Latinos have at times backfired, as when her campaign in December published a post called “7 things Hillary Clinton has in common with your abuela,” prompting the hashtag #NotMyAbuela. But young Latino supporters of both candidates have reasons for their loyalty. When asked what their top reasons were for supporting Sanders, a group of canvassers all gave different answers, from corruption to climate change and student debt. “What’s popular in our generation is striking a chord with everyone, rather than compartmentalizing,” said Fernandez, the undocumented DREAMer from Phoenix. “It all leads back to the same thing if you follow the money.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The article discusses the competition between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton for the votes of young Latino voters in the US. It highlights the fact that the young Latino voter population is rejecting identity politics and looking for candidates that they believe are addressing a multitude of interconnected issues. This includes climate change, immigration, inequality, educational opportunities and social injustice amongst others, rather than focusing on a single issue for one constituent group. These young Latino voters are generally in favor of comprehensive immigration reform, but it is not their sole focus when choosing a candidate. Both Sanders and Clinton have campaigned on immigration reform, but their approaches differ somewhat, with Sanders focusing more on broader themes like income inequality and social injustice. Clinton, on the other hand, has focused more on specific policies and direct appeals to the Latino community. As the article states, \\"As Sanders and Hillary Clinton spent a final day on Friday fighting for Nevada’s large Latino population in advance of Saturday’s caucus, that shifting ground was apparent as young voters in the audiences demanded much more than an answer on immigration.\\" The Latino vote is becoming increasingly important for both the Democratic and Republican Parties in the US, as their share of the electorate continues to grow. This article suggests that Sanders and Clinton's competition for the young Latino votes serves as a preview of how each candidate hopes to appeal to this demographic throughout the 2016 election cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we want to isolate the variable q on one side of the equation. Since -4 is currently multiplied by q, we need to perform the inverse operation, which is division, to eliminate the factor of -4. We will divide both sides of the equation by -4: (-4*q) / (-4) = 28 / (-4) This will simplify to: q = -7 So, the solution to the equation -4*q = 18 + 43 - 33 is q = -7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body - The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth. Question: suppose a person is having difficulties breathing happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"When a person experiences difficulties in breathing, it can have a significant impact on the amount of oxygen being brought into the body as well as on the process of carbon dioxide removal. To better understand the situation, let us first examine the normal breathing process and then discuss the effect of the perturbation on the different steps. In the normal breathing process, air containing oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is drawn into the body through the mouth and nose. This inhaled air travels down the trachea, which divides into bronchial tubes that lead to each lung. The bronchial tubes further branch into smaller tubes called bronchioles, which end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. It is within these alveoli that the exchange of gases occurs – O2 enters the bloodstream by diffusing across the alveolar and capillary walls, while CO2 leaves the bloodstream, following the reverse path, to be expelled from the body. Suppose a person is experiencing difficulties in breathing, which could arise from various factors such as respiratory infections, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other underlying conditions. This perturbation can have several effects on both the amount of oxygen being brought to the body and the removal of carbon dioxide, as explained below: 1. Reduced air intake: In cases where the airflow into the body is restricted due to airway obstruction or poor lung function, less oxygen will be drawn in during each breath, which could lead to lower O2 levels in the bloodstream, tissues, and cells. Consequently, this may impair various physiological processes, particularly those related to energy production. 2. Impaired gas exchange: The efficiency of O2 and CO2 exchange within the alveoli can be affected by factors such as inflammation, edema (fluid buildup), or damage to the alveolar walls – all of which are common consequences of breathing difficulties. These issues can further exacerbate the imbalance of O2 and CO2 levels in the body. Considering the above-discussed effects of breathing difficulties on the respiratory process, we can conclude that a perturbation in this system would result in: A. LESS oxygen being brought to the body: Due to decreased airflow and compromised gas exchange, the body will receive an insufficient amount of oxygen, which may lead to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and negatively affect various physiological processes. B. MORE carbon dioxide accumulation: As the body struggles to expel CO2, there is likely to be an increased accumulation of this waste gas, which can lead to hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels) and cause further harm, such as respiratory acidosis (a condition where blood becomes too acidic). In conclusion, difficulties in breathing can notably impact the respiratory process by making it less effective in providing the body with sufficient oxygen and efficiently removing carbon dioxide. This perturbation can have adverse implications for overall health and well-being, making it crucial to identify and address the underlying causes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear LDL particles from their blood. Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site.

Q: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs. In 2010, Kelly became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in combat operations in Southwest Asia. His youngest son, 1st Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan on Nov. 9, 2010. The younger Kelly was a Marine and was on his third combat tour, but on his first combat tour as a Marine Corps infantry officer. Since his son's death, Kelly has talked in stark terms about the...

Joy Division were an English post-punk band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Sumner and Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were was inspired by the Pistol's performance. The following day Hook borrowed PS35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. Sumner said that he felt that they \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records shop in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in\\". Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, referencing David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. They received immediate national exposure due to reviews of the gig in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they sped off. In August 1977, the band placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \\"fitted perfectly\\" with the other men, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \\"complete 'family'\\". To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing their new name from the sexual slavery wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel House of Dolls. In December, the group recorded what became their debut EP, An Ideal for Living, at Pennine Sound Studio and played their final gig as Warsaw on New Year's Eve at The Swinging Apple in Liverpool. Billed as Warsaw to ensure an audience, the band played their first gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978 at Pip's Disco in Manchester.

Mitä presidentti Mbeki ja muut Afrikan maiden johtajat itse asiassa pelkäävät on se, että väkivalta ja antikolonialistinen kapina voisi levitä myös naapurimaihin. Translate this to English?","completion":"What President Mbeki and other African leaders actually fear is that violence and anti-colonial rebellion could also spread to neighboring countries. This sentence refers to a speculated concern of Thabo Mbeki, a former President of South Africa, as well as other African leaders that violent actions and rebellions against colonial forces could potentially extend beyond the borders of their own countries and affect the stability of neighboring nations. This fear is grounded in the complex and often difficult political history of Africa, which has seen numerous violent uprisings and anti-colonial movements in the past. The impact of such uprisings and movements have often been severe, resulting in political instability, human rights violations, destruction of infrastructure, economic challenges, and loss of life. The leaders' concern here lies not only in the immediate impact of potential violence and rebellion, but also in its long-standing implications. The spread of such actions can undermine the political and socioeconomic development efforts within these countries, hamper regional cooperation efforts, and strain relationships with global partners. In addition, the potential spread of violence can have heavy implications for national security. For countries with a history of internal conflict, the prospect of containing potential violence within borders is already a daunting task, and the spreading of such conflicts to neighboring countries, potentially triggering reciprocal actions or sparking larger regional conflicts, can escalate the situation even further. Ultimately, the fear that President Mbeki and other African leaders have, as hinted in the sentence, reflects their understanding of the intricate political landscape of Africa and the delicate balance required to maintain stability and drive progressive change in their respective countries and the region as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Erin decided to do the second option, because she knew that Jennifer would understand her amazing unicorn wig idea. So, Erin carefully placed the wig on Jennifer's doorstep, and using her sparkly pen, she wrote on a piece of paper, \\"Dear Jennifer, I want my wig to be just like a magical unicorn's mane. Please make it extra colorful and sparkly. Love, Erin.\\" She left the note on top of the wig and went back home.

Paterno was born December 21, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Florence de LaSalle Cafiero, a homemaker, and Angelo Lafayette Paterno, a law clerk. His family was of Italian ancestry. He spoke throughout his life with a marked Brooklyn accent. In 1944, Paterno graduated from Brooklyn Preparatory School. Paterno was a long-time advocate for some type of college football playoff system. The question was posed to him frequently over the years, as only one of his five undefeated teams was voted national champion. Paterno believed that scholarship college athletes should receive a modest stipend, so that they have some spending money. As justification, Paterno pointed out that many scholarship athletes came from poor families and that other students had time to hold down a part-time job, whereas busy practice and conditioning schedules prevented college athletes from working during the school year. Paterno initially preferred not to play true freshmen, but later in his career he did play redshirts in order to refrain from being at a competitive disadvantage. Some Penn State recruits, like recruits at many other schools, now graduate from high school a semester early so that they can enroll in college during the spring semester and participate in spring practice. Several team members from the recruiting class of 2005, including Justin King, Anthony Scirrotto, and Derrick Williams, received considerable playing time as true freshmen during the 2005-2006 season. In 2010, Paterno and former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka suggested that concussions and other injuries in the NFL and college football might be reduced if face masks were eliminated. Penn State's football players were twice recognized for outstanding academic performance by the New America Foundation's Academic Bowl Championship Series while under the leadership of Paterno. The team was ranked number one out of the top 25 ranked BCS teams in 2009 and 2011. The criteria in the rankings include the graduation rate of the team as compared to the rest of university, the difference between the graduation rate of African-American players and the rest of the squad as well as the same statistics for the rest of the students at Penn State, and the graduation rate differences between the African American players and students.

School officials said they were fully aware of the situation. “This matter was immediately referred to police who investigated and charged the student,” said Derek Turner, a spokesman for the county school system. “We’ve also addressed it as a disciplinary matter with the students involved.” Keysar faces two counts of marijuana distribution and two counts of marijuana distribution on school property, according to court records. But he is hardly a major drug dealer, said his attorney, David Moyse. “He’s not even a minor drug dealer,” Moyse said. “William and his family are focused on his future.” Moyse called his client “a fine young man.” He declined to discuss details of the case, saying he wanted to meet with prosecutors before doing so. Charging documents, which outline the police account of the case, spelled out somewhat informal sales transactions — one of which was allegedly captured on school security video. The police case is based, in part, on what Keysar said after being confronted about the ill students, acknowledging that he “gave two girls weed brownies,” according to the charging documents. One of the students who got sick told another girl that she paid 15 for a brownie and shared it with two others. This student bought a second brownie for another student from Keysar, according to the documents, and then gave it to the other student. Dan Morse covers courts and crime in Montgomery County.

Harry thinks that Sally is innocent, although no one else thinks so. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"When considering the linguistic integrity of a sentence, we examine several aspects including syntax (structure and order of words), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (context). Let's analyze the sentence using these parameters: 1. Syntax - \\"Harry thinks that Sally is innocent, although no one else thinks so.\\" This sentence is syntactically correct. It's composed of a main clause, \\"Harry thinks that Sally is innocent,\\" and a subordinate clause, \\"although no one else thinks so.\\" The order of words is logical and adheres to common English language structure. 2. Semantics - It effectively communicates the idea that Harry believes in Sally's innocence, despite differing opinions from others. The words chosen provide clear and concise meaning. 3. Pragmatics - Without more context, it's hard to evaluate pragmatics definitively. However, the sentence does imply certain social dynamics and presents a strong, standalone idea. Thus, considering these different dimensions, we can conclude that the sentence maintains its linguistic integrity as it is syntactically sound, semantically clear, and pragmatically sufficient as a stand-alone context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In which novel does fictional private eye Philip Marlowe first appear? Answer:","completion":"The first appearance of the fictional private eye Philip Marlowe occurs in the novel \\"The Big Sleep\\" by American author Raymond Chandler. The novel was first published in 1939 and is considered to be a classic in the hard-boiled detective fiction genre. Philip Marlowe is a Los Angeles-based private investigator with a strong sense of justice, honor, and personal integrity. The character became iconic for his wit, cynicism, and intelligence, and was often seen navigating the dark and morally corrupt world of criminals, femmes fatales, and corrupt officials. In \\"The Big Sleep,\\" Marlowe is hired by an ailing millionaire, General Sternwood, to investigate a case of blackmail involving his promiscuous younger daughter, Carmen. The blackmailer turns out to be a small-time bookseller named Arthur Geiger, who is running an illegal pornography business. As Marlowe digs deeper into the case, the body count rises and Marlowe is drawn into a complex web of deceit, murder, and organized crime. The novel is a vivid portrayal of the seedy side of Los Angeles during the 1930s and is rich in atmosphere and grounded in the gritty realities of the city. Throughout the course of the story, Marlowe maintains a strong moral compass amid the treachery and morally ambiguous characters. Chandler's writing style, peppered with sharp one-liners and blending noir elements with the hard-boiled detective tradition, helped elevate \\"The Big Sleep\\" to both critical and popular acclaim. The success of \\"The Big Sleep\\" led to a series of novels featuring Philip Marlowe, including \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\" (1940), \\"The High Window\\" (1942), \\"The Lady in the Lake\\" (1943), \\"The Little Sister\\" (1949), \\"The Long Goodbye\\" (1953), and \\"Playback\\" (1958). The character of Marlowe has also been adapted into numerous films, radio dramas, television shows, and stage plays, further solidifying the character's legacy as a cornerstone of American detective fiction and popular culture. In conclusion, \\"The Big Sleep\\" is the first novel featuring the iconic private detective Philip Marlowe. The story revolves around Marlowe being tasked with solving a blackmail case, which eventually leads him down a treacherous path filled with corruption, murder, and intrigue. The novel and its protagonist, Philip Marlowe, served as a template for numerous detective stories and their archetypical characters, impacting the development of crime fiction and popular culture for decades to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what increases a body's strength\\" is \\"through play\\", given that running and lifting increases a body's strength? The answer is:","completion":"While \\"through play\\" may be a component of increasing a body's strength, it is not a comprehensive or detailed answer to the question. A more thorough response would be: Increasing a body's strength can be achieved through various means, including regular exercise, proper nutrition, adequate rest, and consistent practice. Engaging in strength-building exercises such as weightlifting, resistance training, and bodyweight exercises (e.g., push-ups, pull-ups, squats) helps to break down muscle fibers, which are then rebuilt and strengthened during recovery. Running, a form of cardiovascular exercise, can also contribute to overall strength by improving heart health, endurance, and muscular tone, particularly in the lower body. However, running might not be the most effective way to increase strength, mainly if the focus is on building muscle mass and overall power. Nutrition also plays a significant role in increasing physical strength. Consuming a balanced diet, rich in protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, is vital for providing the body with the necessary fuel and nutrients to build and repair muscles efficiently. Lastly, giving the body adequate rest and recovery time is crucial in the process of building strength. Recovery allows the muscles to repair and grow, ultimately leading to increased strength. Sleep is an essential aspect of this, as healthy sleeping habits promote optimal muscle repair and hormone regulation. \\"Through play\\" could be a valid means of increasing strength if it incorporates activities that provide the above elements, such as sports that involve running, jumping, and other movements that work the body's muscles. However, this answer does not fully address the factors involved in fostering strength development."},{"prompt":"Q: You are given a sentence in Persian.

When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\" He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\" However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was.

Article:","completion":"Title: Catching a Halibut: A Fun and Easy Adventure at the Sea Hello little friends! Today, we are going to learn about how to catch a cool fish called halibut. Imagine you are on a fun boat ride with your family, and you get to do a really great adventure at the sea. Here is what you need to do: 1. Drop your bait close to the bottom of the sea floor: When you want to catch a halibut, you need to use something called 'bait' to make the fish interested in your fishing line. The bait can be something like a little piece of food that the fish really likes to eat. You need to put this bait on a special thing called a 'hook', and then you drop it deep into the water until it reaches near the bottom part of the sea where the ground is. This is where halibut usually like to hang out. 2. Wait for a halibut to take the bait: Now that your bait is deep in the water and close to the sea floor, you need to be very patient and wait for a halibut to see the bait and think, \\"Yummy! That looks like a tasty snack!\\" When a halibut comes along and starts to eat the bait, you will feel that your fishing line is moving or getting a little bit heavier. 3. Set your hook and steadily pull the line up with control: Once you feel that a halibut is eating your bait, we have to do a thing called 'setting the hook'. This means you have to gently pull on the fishing line so that the hook catches the fish. Remember to do this carefully and with control, we don't want to hurt the fish, but we want to make sure it doesn't get away. After setting the hook, you can start slowly lifting the fishing line up from the water. 4. Allow a \\"spooked\\" halibut to run free for a bit: Sometimes, when a halibut realizes it is being caught, it gets scared and starts to swim very fast to get away. This is called a \\"spooked\\" halibut. If this happens, it's okay! Just let the fish swim a little bit and then slowly start pulling the fishing line again. The halibut may get tired after a while and will be easier to catch. That's it! Now you know how to catch a halibut during your fun adventure at the sea. Remember, it's important to be gentle and patient when catching a fish. Halibut are amazing creatures, and by following these steps, you can experience the joy of catching one.

Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety.

After his wife's death, he has taken time to raise his daughters. Having known no romance in quite some time, nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant Marie, at a local book store in a Rhode Island small town on the ocean, where he has gone to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. After liking Marie at first sight, little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound. After all, she is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. It is clear from the outset that Dan and Marie are made for one another, and although we sense what the outcome will be, we go for the fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, an author and screenplay writer on his own, has given us two excellent novels, \\"What's Eating Gilber Grapes\\", and \\"An Ocean in Iowa\\", and the delightful indie, \\"Pieces of April, which he also directed. It's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during Thanksgiving reunions. The best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. Mr. Carell, in fact, keeps getting better all the time. In many ways, he remind us of Jack Lemmon, in his take of comedy and serious material. What can one say about Ms. Binoche, an intelligent actress, and a bright presence in any film. She proves she is right up to doing comedy, convincing us about her Marie. The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture. John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, have nothing to do. They just serve as incidental music for decoration. Dane Cook, who is seen as brother Mitch, fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others. \\"Dan in Real Life\\" is a delightful film that will please everyone.

So, which is the best bike for you? If you're traveling to work, a folding bike such as one of the models here is suitable unless you're cycling more than a couple of miles, in which case it might be uncomfortable . You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure . For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous. Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300. A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350. For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand. Expect to pay around PS500. Once you've picked your bike, sizing is crucial or you may suffer back or neck pain. A famous bike shop will help you choose the right size frame. The height of the seat should be adjusted carefully---again, a good shop will advise. If you only plan to cycle once or twice a month, you can choose a lower-priced bike, but for regular use, paying more means better quality: cheaper bikes need more frequent adjustment of brakes and gears ---and tend to be heavier, too.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals? ? John Doubleday (about 1798 – 25 January 1856) was a British craftsperson, restorer, and dealer in antiquities who was employed by the British Museum for the last 20 years of his life. He undertook several duties for the museum, not least as a witness in criminal trials, but was primarily their specialist restorer, perhaps the first person to hold the position. He is best known for his 1845 restoration of the severely-damaged Roman Portland Vase, an accomplishment that places him at the forefront of his profession at the time. While at the British Museum, Doubleday also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals. His casts in coloured sulphur and in white metal of works in both national and private collections, allowed smaller collections to hold copies at a fraction of the price that the originals would command. Thousands of his copies entered the collections of institutions and individuals. Yet the accuracy he achieved led to confusion with the originals; after his death he was labelled a forger, but with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\".Little is known about Doubleday's upbringing or personal life. Several sources describe him as an American, including the 1851 United Kingdom census, which records him as a New York-born British subject. An obituary noted that he worked at a printer's shop for more than 20 years during his youth, which gave him the experience of casting type that he would employ in his later career as a copyist. Doubleday's early life, family, and education are otherwise unknown. He died in 1856, leaving a wife and five daughters, all English; the eldest child was born around 1833.

Below is a detailed procedure: The given equation is: 703 = 42*a + 15 - 68 Start by performing the addition and subtraction operation on the right hand side. Combine +15 and -68 to get -53, therefore, the equation becomes: 703 = 42*a - 53 Next, we'll isolate the term with 'a' (42*a) on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 53 on both sides of the equation to cancel out -53 on the right. 703 + 53 = 42*a - 53 + 53 Which simplifies to: 756 = 42*a Now, we need to get 'a' by itself. Since 42 is multiplied by 'a' on the right hand side, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 42 to solve for 'a'. 756 / 42 = 42*a / 42 That simplifies to: a = 756 / 42 Perform the division operation to get the value of 'a'. a = 18 Therefore, the solution to the equation 703 = 42*a + 15 - 68 for a is a = 18."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Government's \\"Comfort Letters\\" to 'On the Runs' Threaten to Reignite Loyalist Anger Introduction: The revelation of so-called \\"comfort letters\\" has sparked controversy in Northern Ireland. These letters, sent from the government to individuals suspected of involvement in past criminal activities often linked to paramilitary organizations, have offered reassurance that they are no longer wanted by the authorities. The issue has emerged in the wake of the collapsed Hyde Park bombing case, threatening to reignite Loyalist anger in the region. Step 1: Explaining the \\"comfort letters\\" and their origins As a response to the growing unrest and demand for justice, the government discreetly sent out these \\"comfort letters\\" to individuals known as \\"on the runs,\\" those who have been linked to criminal activities in the past but are currently not facing any charges. The purpose of these letters was to reassure these individuals and keep the peace in Northern Ireland. Step 2: Discussing the implications of the Hyde Park bombing case The collapse of the Hyde Park bombing case has brought to light the existence of these secret guarantees. The Hyde Park bombing, a notorious IRA attack that took place in 1982, left four soldiers dead and resulted in a long and complicated legal battle. Despite the discovery of a key suspect, the case ultimately collapsed due to a lack of substantial evidence and issues related to these \\"comfort letters.\\" Step 3: Considering the potential fallout and Loyalist anger The revelation of these \\"comfort letters\\" has fueled the already charged tensions in Northern Ireland, threatening to reignite Loyalist anger. The potential for a resurgence of violence and political instability is concerning, given the region's tumultuous history with acts of terrorism and the ongoing fight for justice. Step 4: Connecting the issue to the unsolved case of Jean McConville The revelation of these \\"comfort letters\\" coincides with the ongoing fight for justice for the family of Jean McConville, an IRA victim who was abducted and murdered in 1972. Her case, still unresolved, serves as a stark reminder of the continued impact of past acts of terrorism and political violence on the families of victims. Conclusion: As the controversy surrounding the government's \\"comfort letters\\" unfolds, there is growing concern about the potential destabilization of Northern Ireland. The secrecy and implications of these reassurances to suspected criminals have angered many and threaten to reopen old wounds. The pursuit of justice for victims like Jean McConville and the families of the Hyde Park bombing remains paramount, and the ramifications of these revelations will likely fuel ongoing debates about how to address and heal from Northern Ireland's troubled past."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be given two sentences separated by \\"because\\".

The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where was Professor Kristan's mother bitten by a vampire bat? ? The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Professor Kristan's mother was bitten by a vampire bat in a cave in Africa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information: - The Canadian Prairies is a region in western Canada, which may correspond to several different definitions, natural or political. Notably, the Prairie provinces or simply the Prairies comprise the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as they are partially covered by prairie (grasslands). In a more restricted sense, the term may also refer only to the areas of those provinces covered by prairie; their portions of the physiographic region known as the Interior Plains. Prairie also covers portions of northeastern British Columbia, though that province is typically not included in the region in a political sense. - Amegilla is a large genus of bees in the tribe Anthophorini. Several species have blue metallic bands on the abdomen, and are referred to as \\"blue-banded bees\\". - The Centridini are a tribe of large apid bees, many of which possess adaptations for carrying floral oils rather than (or in addition to) pollen or nectar. The floral oils are often gathered from plants of the family Malpighiaceae, though other plants may be visited. The oil-collecting species typically have \\"combs\\" composed of closely spaced, flattened, blunt bristles on the margins of the first tarsal segments of the front and middle legs; others may have velvety \\"pads\\" to absorb the oils. They also commonly gather plant resins for use in nest cell construction. They have a tiny pterostigma in the forewing, the female scopa is very bushy, and the first flagellomere of the antenna is often longer than the scape. - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - The bee genus Anthophora is one of the largest in the family Apidae, with over 450 species worldwide in 14 different subgenera. They are most abundant and diverse in the Holarctic and African biogeographic regions. All species are solitary, though many nest in large aggregations. Nearly all species make nests in the soil, either in banks or in flat ground; the larvae develop in cells with waterproof linings and do not spin cocoons. Males commonly have pale white or yellow facial markings, and/or peculiarly modified leg armature and hairs. \\"Anthophora\\" individuals can be distinguished from the very similar genus \\"Amegilla\\" by the possession of an arolium between the tarsal claws. - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. - Texas is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population. Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares borders with the U.S. states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. - The Melectini are a tribe of medium - to large - sized apid bees found essentially worldwide . They are brood parasites of the related typical digger bees ( Anthophorini ) and occasionally visit flowers e.g. in prairie landscapes of the United States . As in other cuckoo bees , females can be easily distinguished from those of their hosts by the lack of scopae and other pollen - collecting adaptations , as well as lacking prepygidial fimbria and basitibial plates . Their body hair is rather short and on the abdomen lies flat against the exoskeleton . They may , therefore , be difficult at first glance to distinguish from the Nomadinae , but the details of their wing venation are characteristic : the marginal cell is shorter than the first two submarginal cells , and the second abscissa of vein M + Cu is extremely short , with the cells it connects being almost adjacent to each other . The jugal lobes are very small , less than half as long as the vannal lobes . - Saskatchewan (or ) is a prairie and boreal province in west-central Canada, the only province without natural borders. It has an area of , nearly 10 percent of which is fresh water, composed mostly of rivers, reservoirs, and the province's 100,000 lakes. - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities. - Apidae is the largest family within the superfamily Apoidea, containing at least 5700 species of bees. The family includes some of the most commonly seen bees, including bumblebees and honey bees, but also includes stingless bees (also used for honey production), carpenter bees, orchid bees, cuckoo bees, and a number of other less widely known groups. Many are valuable pollinators in natural habitats and for agricultural crops. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - The Anthophorini are a large tribe in the subfamily Apinae of the family Apidae. Species in this tribe are often referred to as digger bees, although this common name is sometimes also applied to members of the tribe Centridini. It has over 750 species worldwide that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae; the vast majority of species are in the genera \\"Amegilla\\" and \\"Anthophora\\". - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States.

Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Alberta is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1, 1905. The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015. - Prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay as well as the steppes of Eurasia. Lands typically referred to as \\"prairie\\" tend to be in North America. The term encompasses the area referred to as the Interior Lowlands of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, somewhat hillier land to the east. In the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and western and southern Minnesota. The Central Valley of California is also a prairie. The Canadian Prairies occupy vast areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. - The Apinae are the subfamily that includes the majority of bees in the family Apidae. It includes the familiar \\"corbiculate\\" (pollen basket) bees bumblebees, honey bees, orchid bees, stingless bees, and the extinct genus \\"Euglossopteryx\\". It also includes all but two of the groups (excluding Nomadinae and Xylocopinae) that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae. - In geography, a plain is a flat area. Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains. - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America.

The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.

Though bleeding, he sees Michael lying a few feet away, dead, the bullet having struck him in the head. Tears stinging his eyes, Archer crawls over and holds his dead son's body while Castor looks up from the scope of his rifle, stunned to see that he has just killed a child.

Background: Ilya Nikolayevich Bryzgalov ( ( listen); Russian: Il'ia Nikolaevich Bryzgalov; born 22 June 1980) is a Russian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He was selected in the second round of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, 44th overall, by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He has also played for the Phoenix Coyotes, Philadelphia Flyers, Edmonton Oilers and Minnesota Wild. In 2006-07 season, Bryzgalov won the Stanley Cup with the Anaheim Ducks. Context: With the re-signing of Giguere to a four-year contract in the off-season and the acquisition of Jonas Hiller from Switzerland, the Ducks attempted to trade Bryzgalov, but were unable to. General Manager Brian Burke claimed he had a deal worked out at the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, but could not finish it. As a result, on 16 November 2007, Bryzgalov was placed on waivers and claimed by the Phoenix Coyotes the following day, on 17 November. In his first game with the team that same day, Bryzgalov made 27 saves for his third career shutout in a 1-0 win over the Los Angeles Kings. Phoenix promptly signed him to a three-year contract extension and he went on to record 26 wins in 55 games for the Coyotes as they battled for a playoff spot, establishing himself as the club's starting goaltender. Bryzgalov again recorded 26 wins for the Coyotes during the 2008-09 season, though the Coyotes did not qualify for the playoffs. But the 2009-10 season would be a different story for Bryzgalov and the Coyotes, who would qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2002 on the back of Bryzgalov's 42 victories. The fourth-seeded Coyotes would face-off against the veteran Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Quarter-Finals. The series proved to be a see-saw battle that eventually saw Detroit prevail in seven games. Bryzgalov averaged 3.43 goals against per game during the series. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Coyotes during the 2010-11 season, Bryzgalov's 36 wins helped them to the sixth seed in the Western Conference and a return trip to the playoffs. Once again, the Coyotes faced the Red Wings. Despite Bryzgalov's strong play throughout the regular season, he struggled in the playoff rematch with Detroit, averaging 4.36 goals against per game as the Red Wings swept the Coyotes in four straight games. Set to become an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, the Coyotes did not meet Bryzgalov's asking price for a contract extension. On 6 June 2011, Bryzgalov's negotiation rights were traded to the Philadelphia Flyers for a third-round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, forward Matt Clackson, and future considerations. Bryzgalov averaged 33 victories a season the past four seasons with the Coyotes. Question: How did the team do score wise. Whats the answer?","completion":"Let me explain this in a simple way. Ilya Bryzgalov is a very good ice hockey player who used to be a goalkeeper. He played for many teams, and in one season, he helped the Phoenix Coyotes team get 42 wins, which allowed them to play in the important games called playoffs. The team tried hard but lost to the Detroit Red Wings in a very close match. Even though Bryzgalov played well the next season, they lost again to the same team. So, to answer your question, the team did pretty well with Bryzgalov's help, but they could not win the most important games called playoffs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - William Holman Hunt (2 April 1827 7 September 1910) was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism. These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs. For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact. Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career. He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works. - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity. - A university museum is a repository of collections run by a university, typically founded to aid teaching and research within the institution of higher learning. The Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford in England is an early example, originally housed in the building that is now the Museum of the History of Science. A more recent example is the Holburne Museum of Art in Bath, originally constructed as a hotel in 1796 it is now the official museum of the University of Bath. - Nubia is a region along the Nile river located in what is today northern Sudan and southern Egypt. It was one of the earliest civilizations of ancient Africa, with a history that can be traced from at least 2000 B.C. onward (through Nubian monuments and artifacts, as well as written records from Egypt and Rome), and was home to one of the African empires. There were a number of large Nubian kingdoms throughout the Postclassical Era, the last of which collapsed in 1504, when Nubia became divided between Egypt and the Sennar sultanate, resulting in the Arabization of much of the Nubian population. Nubia was again united within Ottoman Egypt in the 19th century, and within the Kingdom of Egypt from 1899 to 1956. - The Ashmolean Museum (in full the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology) on Beaumont Street, Oxford, England, is the world's first university museum. Its first building was erected in 16781683 to house the cabinet of curiosities that Elias Ashmole gave to the University of Oxford in 1677. The museum reopened in 2009 after a major redevelopment. In November 2011, new galleries focusing on Egypt and Nubia were also unveiled. - Elias Ashmole (23 May 1617 18 May 1692) was a celebrated English antiquary, politician, officer of arms, astrologer and student of alchemy. Ashmole supported the royalist side during the English Civil War, and at the restoration of Charles II he was rewarded with several lucrative offices. - Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016.

Both also stressed the primitivism of the scene . - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading. - Christ in the House of His Parents (184950) is a painting by John Everett Millais depicting the Holy Family in Saint Joseph's carpentry workshop. The painting was extremely controversial when first exhibited, prompting many negative reviews, most notably one written by Charles Dickens. It catapulted the previously obscure Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to notoriety and was a major contributor to the debate about Realism in the arts. - The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown. - The University of Oxford (informally Oxford University or simply Oxford) is a collegiate research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled northeast to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \\"ancient universities\\" are frequently jointly referred to as \\"Oxbridge\\". - Thomas Carlyle (4 December 1795 5 February 1881) was a Scottish philosopher, satirical writer, essayist, historian and teacher. Considered one of the most important social commentators of his time, he presented many lectures during his lifetime with certain acclaim in the Victorian era. One of those conferences resulted in his famous work \\"On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History\\" where he explains that the key role in history lies in the actions of the \\"Great Man\\", claiming that \\"History is nothing but the biography of the Great Man\\". - John Ruskin (8 February 1819 20 January 1900) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, as well as an art patron, draughtsman, watercolourist, a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as geology, architecture, myth, ornithology, literature, education, botany and political economy. His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. Ruskin also penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art was later superseded by a preference for plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

Question: What is Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular? Context: Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people. One of them I will name, the other two are mysteries and will remain so. Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV. He is unlucky in life. Unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the Yelnats men and has been since exploits of Stanley IV's \`no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' Those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill-fated turn. It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV. He has been accused, falsely, of stealing a pair of baseball shoes, freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction, by a famous baseball player. He is given the option of jail, or he can go to a character building camp. \`I've never been to camp before,' says Stanley. With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake. Camp Green Lake is an odd place, with an odd philosophy, \`If you take a bad boy, make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy.' We learn this little pearl of wisdom from Mr. Sir (John Voight) one of the camp's \`counselors.' We get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man. He at least wears his attitude honestly; he doesn't think he is nice. The camp's guidance councilor, Mr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) is a different matter entirely. He acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor, but he quick, quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges. The Warden has a decided capacity for meanness, but other than that she is a mystery. These three rule Camp Green Lake, a place that has no lake. It is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes, five feet deep and five feet wide. Its local fauna, seem only to be the vultures, and dangerous poisonous yellow-spotted lizards. Green Lake seems is, in many ways, a haunted place. Holes works in spite of the strange setting, and the strange story, because it understands people. Specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of Camp Green Lake. The movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly. It captures the way boys can bully each other, they way they can win admiration, the way they fight with one another, and the way boys ally themselves along the age line. It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable. What is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character. He does not believe in a family curse, he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his \`no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' In fact he loves hearing the story. Stanley IV is not bitter about the past, and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather. There is at times a lot of sadness in the film, but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness. And that is refreshing. Holes is an intelligent, insightful and witty family movie. It entertains, and not in any cheap way. It is not a comedy, though it has its laughs. It dares to be compelling, where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional. As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy. I give it a 10.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review is overwhelmingly positive.

How is \\"God be with you.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"God be with you.\\" can be translated as \\"Buď s Bohem.\\" This phrase is often used to bid farewell to someone and can be considered as a kind and meaningful way to say goodbye, similar to how one might use \\"goodbye,\\" \\"farewell,\\" or \\"take care\\" in English. In this translation, \\"Buď\\" means \\"be,\\" \\"s\\" means \\"with,\\" and \\"Bohem\\" means \\"God\\" in Czech. Czech is a West Slavic language mainly spoken in the Czech Republic and is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian languages. It's worth mentioning that Czech people, while being predominantly Christian, nowadays tend to be more secular in their beliefs. This means that using religious phrases like \\"Buď s Bohem\\" may not be as common as it once was. However, it is still a familiar phrase, and many people still use it to convey their well-wishes and good intentions when parting ways with someone. In certain contexts, you might also encounter \\"Nashledanou\\" (goodbye) or \\"Ahoj\\" (an informal greeting or farewell, similar to \\"hi\\" or \\"bye\\" in English) as alternatives to \\"Buď s Bohem.\\" These phrases might be more suitable for casual circumstances or when addressing someone with whom you have a more informal relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cooper was born on May 7, 1901, in Helena, Montana to Alice (nee Brazier, 1873-1967) and Charles Henry Cooper (1865-1946). His father had emigrated from Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire and was a prominent lawyer, rancher, and (later) a Montana Supreme Court justice. His mother had emigrated from Gillingham, Kent and married Charles in Montana. In 1906, Charles purchased the 600-acre (240 ha) Seven-Bar-Nine cattle ranch about fifty miles (eighty kilometers) north of Helena near the town of Craig on the Missouri River. For me the really satisfying things I do are offered me, free, for nothing. Ever go out in the fall and do a little hunting? See the frost on the grass and the leaves turning? Spend a day in the hills alone, or with good companions? Watch a sunset and a moonrise? Notice a bird in the wind? A stream in the woods, a storm at sea, cross the country by train, and catch a glimpse of something beautiful in the desert, or the farmlands? Free to everybody ... Cooper's twenty-year friendship with Ernest Hemingway began at Sun Valley in October 1940. The previous year, Hemingway drew upon Cooper's image when he created the character of Robert Jordan for the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. The two shared a passion for the outdoors, and for years they hunted duck and pheasant, and skied together in Sun Valley. Both men admired the work of Rudyard Kipling--Cooper kept a copy of the poem \\"If--\\" in his dressing room--and retained as adults Kipling's sense of boyish adventure. As well as admiring Cooper's hunting skills and knowledge of the outdoors, Hemingway believed his character matched his screen persona, once telling a friend, \\"If you made up a character like Coop, nobody would believe it. He's just too good to be true.\\" They saw each other often, and their friendship remained strong through the years. Cooper's social life generally centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties with his family and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor. As well as hunting, Cooper enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving. He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1956. Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 Duesenberg. Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective, and loved the solitude of outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional \\"yup\\" and \\"shucks\\". He once said, \\"If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet.\\" According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status--never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, \\"Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him.\\"","completion":"This text is about Gary Cooper, a famous American actor who was born on May 7, 1901, in Helena, Montana.

A: Answer:","completion":"All crocodilians, with a diet of live animals such as birds, small mammals, and fish, are considered carnivorous apex predators. These fascinating creatures, which include alligators, caimans, gharials, and crocodiles, play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their respective ecosystems. As apex predators, crocodilians sit at the top of their food chain. This means that they have no natural predators, apart from humans, and they are responsible for controlling the population of the prey species they consume. By preying on smaller mammals, birds, and fish, they help keep the number of these animals in check, preventing overpopulation and ensuring the overall health and stability of their environment. Crocodilian feeding habits can vary depending on several factors, such as their species, age, size, and the availability of prey. Although they are all carnivorous, some may exhibit a preference for specific types of prey. For example, gharials, which have a narrow snout, primarily feed on fish, while the larger saltwater crocodile is known to prey on larger mammals such as deer and even buffalo. These reptiles have a unique method of hunting, which involves stealth, patience, and incredible speed. They often lie in wait on the edges of water bodies, partially submerged, waiting for an unsuspecting prey item to come within striking distance. Once their target is within reach, crocodilians use their powerful jaws to snatch the prey and drag it underwater to be eaten or drowned. Crocodilians have evolved a variety of adaptations that make them excellent hunters and efficient predators. Some of these adaptations include: 1. Powerful Jaws: Crocodilians have incredibly strong jaw muscles, enabling them to grip and hold onto their prey with ease. Their bite force is among the strongest measured in any living animal, ensuring their prey is unable to escape once caught. 2. Sharp Teeth: They possess numerous sharp, cone-shaped teeth well suited to grabbing and holding onto prey. Crocodilian teeth are designed more for holding rather than tearing, as they can swallow small prey whole and tear larger prey into manageable pieces. 3. Camouflage: Their coloration and markings provide them with excellent camouflage in their aquatic environments, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings and remain inconspicuous while they wait for prey. 4. Ambush Hunting: Crocodilians are skilled ambush hunters, remaining motionless and hidden from sight until their prey is within range. They will strike with incredible speed, catching their prey off guard. 5. Strong Swimmers: Crocodilians are streamlined and powerful swimmers, which enables them to chase down aquatic prey or swiftly close the distance to terrestrial prey at the water's edge. 6. Nostrils and Eyes on Top: One remarkable feature of crocodilians is the positioning of their nostrils and eyes on the top of their heads. This allows them to submerge most of their body underwater while still being able to breathe and see, increasing their stealth and ability to ambush prey. In summary, crocodilians are carnivorous apex predators that play a crucial role in their respective ecosystems. Consuming a diet of live animals, which includes birds, small mammals, and fish, they are adept at controlling prey populations and maintaining ecological balance. Their evolutionary adaptations make them highly effective hunters and formidable predators in their environments."},{"prompt":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin.

Dictionary and Books: These are not physical locations where one can spot a living creature. They could only refer to metaphorical or literary appearances, which does not align with common sense in this scenario. b. Australia: While Australia has rivers, beavers are not native to the continent. However, there's a possibility of spotting a beaver if it had been introduced to the area, but it is less likely and not a common scenario. c. Seaside: Beavers are freshwater animals, typically found in rivers and wetlands rather than in coastal or marine environments. While it's not impossible to find a beaver near a seaside, it's less likely than in areas with freshwater habitats. d. Countryside: Countryside areas are often characterized by large expanses of undeveloped land with forests, rivers, and wetlands, which are ideal habitats for beavers. 3. Conclusion: Based on the context of the question and analysis of the given options, \\"countryside\\" is the answer that aligns best with human common sense, because beavers are more commonly found in rivers and wetlands in rural areas, making it a more believable and likely location to spot a wet beaver in the river."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He does this to demonstrate that the guests' kindness and hospitality are not directed toward him as a person, but rather to his clothing and the status they represent. When Mr. Clark poses the question \\"What are you doing?\\" to the guests, he answers by asserting that he is asking his coat to eat the food because it is clear that their hospitality is meant for his clothes, not for him. This highlights the fact that the guests judge and treat people based on their appearance, rather than their character or their inherent value. Therefore, when Mr. Clark comes to the party in good clothes, the correct answer is D) the people are good with him. This scenario reveals the unfortunate truth about how some people's kindness and respect can be superficial and based solely on outward appearances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

Write some highlights for the following article: Governor of New Jersey? Who'd want THAT job? It's a state where politics have long been considered a bloodsport, where corrupt politicians are as common as slices of pizza, where fights can quickly get personal, and where the top politician lives a life constantly on the edge. It's a state whose politics have been awash in scandals for decades, particularly within its towns and communities. In the past 20 years, the state's biggest cultural exports have been a show about organized crime and \\"Jersey Shore\\" -- a show, as most New Jersey residents will be quick to tell you starred mostly New Yorkers. But, in spite of this, New Jerseyans take great pride in their state and have taken great pride in their governor. Before taking the state's highest office, Chris Christie toppled corrupt New Jersey mayors like they were dominoes, sending them to jail one after another. It was one of the most impressive demonstrations of good government in the state's history. Borger: Is Chris Christie presidential? As governor, he was lauded for his leadership and his outspokenness, and he was criticized by some in his own party for his praise of President Obama after Hurricane Sandy. But what never wavered was Christie's commitment to taking on the big issues. So for many New Jerseyans, it's disappointing to see Christie now focused on answering for the actions of staff. What they did was wrong, but if you stop and look more closely, those attacking him most harshly clearly have their own agendas. Take Democratic Sen. Loretta Weinberg. She'd love to make Christie's downfall her legacy. Prior to this current drama, Weinberg is best known for being a victim of the Bernie Madoff scam, and then for drawing on a pension system to supplement her legislative salary. She and Christie have been battling for years, and she's seeing an opportunity for payback. Meanwhile, Democratic Assemblyman Jon Wisniewski, another Christie foe, is dying for a better position in leadership, even though he's deputy speaker, a powerful chairman and the new head of an investigative committee. He's certainly got an eye on the front office himself. And Congressman Frank Pallone? He's only spent decades trying to run for statewide office. He'd love to take down Christie and ignore the fact that tourism ads are regular practice in New Jersey or any other state with an abundant coastline. The congressman certainly never complained about tourism ads during the 25 years he's represented a district that benefited from those very tourist dollars. Ad firm head: We were asked about using Christie in ad campaign. It's not just New Jersey Democrats who are playing politics with the outspoken governor and possible candidate for president in 2016. Democrats on the national level are sending fundraising letters and raising money on the backs of the popular governor. They'll do whatever it takes to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. But the most disappointing attacks are coming from the right wing of the Republican Party. After two crushing presidential elections and a paralyzed Congress, our party is badly in need of leadership. With a strong, outspoken candidate, Republicans could be right back on top. Demonstrated leadership is what will be needed in the big domestic fights that are right over the horizon, as well as those brewing overseas. Just don't let the candidate be from New Jersey. They say that if everyone hates you, you must be doing something right. Can Christie change the subject? Last week Christie held an exhausting two-hour press conference to answer questions about Fort Lee. It could not have been easy to distance himself from his two-time campaign manager -- the man who would have run Christie's presidential campaign should he choose to run. Try to remember the last time you saw a politician separate himself from someone that powerful in the organization. I'm hard pressed to find one. This week in his speech, Christie again addressed the issue. But what he did next took great leadership. He proposed longer school days. He proposed changes to the state tax code. He took on the pension system. Christie still isn't afraid to do big things. The guy is gearing up for the next big fight. The fight for New Jersey. For now, anyway. The long shadow of politics, both Democrat and Republican will keep hovering -- as will the national media -- waiting for his next move, eyeing his fundraising trips, watching for early signs of 2016 interest. None of which is going to deter the governor from doing what is necessary. There's something to be said for a politician who makes tough decisions. What also should be said is, governor, thanks for taking the job. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Camooso Miller.","completion":"The article highlights the challenges faced by the Governor of New Jersey due to the complex and intense political landscape. The state has a history of political scandals, corruption, and personal battles, making it a difficult job for any politician. New Jerseyans are proud of their state and want good governance, but are often disappointed by their Governor getting caught up in controversies. Chris Christie, the former governor, was known for his leadership and outspokenness, but also faced criticism for supporting President Obama post-Hurricane Sandy. Despite this, he continued to tackle key issues in the state. Some of Christie's opponents, both Democrats and Republicans, seem to have personal agendas and political aspirations, adding to the complexity of the state's politics. Despite this, Gov. Christie held a two-hour press conference to address concerns about Fort Lee and proposed important changes to the state tax code, pension system, and school days. It is clear that Christie is prepared to fight for the future of New Jersey, even in an environment filled with political opponents waiting for his next move. The article concludes by appreciating Gov. Christie for making tough decisions and taking on the challenging job of leading New Jersey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Roma couple buried their ten-week-old daughter in a Paris suburb miles from their home today, after the mayor of the town where they live refused to allow her to be buried there. About 200 family members and townspeople attended a funeral Mass in Champlan, a Paris commuter town, on Monday. A hearse then took the small coffin to the town of Wissous for burial. Wissous offered a gravesite for the baby after Champlan mayor Christian Leclerc reportedly refused a burial, saying the local cemetery had 'too few plots' and 'priority is given to those who pay taxes'. Scroll down for video. Tragic: Iliana and Marin Francesca, both kneeling, grieve over the coffin of their ten-week-old daughter as she is laid to rest in a cemetery in Wissous, France, after she was refused a place in a cemetery in their town. Pain: The grieving parents and their relatives sob as they prepare to bury the baby girl. Insult heaped on loss: Wissous offered a gravesite for the baby after Christian Leclerc, the mayor of Champlan, where the family live, reportedly refused a burial, saying the local cemetery had 'too few plots' Under heavy criticism, Mayor Leclerc later denied ever refusing a burial site. A top government official said he would investigate. Whatever the truth, the case has brought to light the racism faced by France's estimated 20,000 Roma, also known as gipsies. Like Maria's parents, most live in makeshift camps with few basic amenities. The community in general is regularly linked to crime and anti-social behaviour. Pictures showed Iliana and Marin Francesca sobbing over their daughter Maria's white coffin on an damp and overcast morning in Wissous cemetery. Most of the mourners appeared to be from the Roma community, but others looked like wellwishers who had lent their support out of outrage over the way the tragic case has been handled. Loic Gandais, a Roma rights campaigner, said Mr Leclerc was simply expressing a hatred of Roma which is now widespread across France. 'It's about racism, xenophobia, and stigmatisation,' said Mr Gandais, saying the baby died in hospital in Corbeil-Essonnes from sudden infant death syndrome on Boxing Day. Sadness: Iliana and Marin Francesca walk behind their daughter's hearse as it approaches the grave plot. Difficult: Mrs Francesca stumbles in her grief as she and other mourners follow the slowly moving hearse. Why? The couple raise their faces to the sky as they grieve for their daughter, who was just ten weeks old. 'The pain of the mother must not be worsened': Right-wing UMP party mayor of Wissous, Richard Trinquier, in front of the town's city hall. He offered a plot for the child's burial, saying it was a 'question of humanity' Mr and Mrs Francesca are Romanians who have been living in France for eight years, sending their two other young children to local schools. The plot in Wissous was made available for their late daughter after Richard Trinquier, the local mayor, said it was a 'question of humanity'. 'The pain of a mother who carried a child for nine months, and lost her after two and a half months must not be worsened,' said Mr Tranquier as he announced his decision. Champlan's Roma gipsies live on two plots without fresh water or electricity. There are frequent calls for their camp to be razed. Mr Valls, France's Socialist Prime Minister, is among many who have expressed a desire to see the country rid of its Roma community. As Interior Minister, he often approved orders aimed at smashing up Roma camps and evicting entire families. He said on one occasion: 'The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. 'We are not here to welcome these people…It's not France's job to deal with the misery of the whole world.' But he struck a conciliatory note after the scandal surrounding Maria Francesca's burial, writing on Twitter: 'Refusing a child a burial because of its roots is an insult to its memory, an insult to France.'

Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans. One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the \\"black\\" off him, but finds it does not work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the \\"Negro in the bathroom\\" is him.

Article: Half a year before graduation from college, my son David began to seek a job. Due to the financial crisis, the competition was ever-fierce. My son targeted a company that was located in a coastal city. It was intended to employ only one person among more than twenty candidates, I said to David, \\"You should not harbor too much hope for fear that you would feel terribly disappointed when you fail.\\" He said to me, \\"I am not afraid of disappointment. As long as I try, there will always be hope!\\" Three young men could enter the final round, which would later decide one person to be employed. Everything seemed to go quite well and David entered the final round in a week. Unexpectedly, the interview was unbelievably simple, during which the interviewer only chatted with them for a while. The interview strategies my son prepared were not useful at all. The interviewer said the company would inform them of the result in 3 days. On the morning of the third day, David received the text from the company that he was not employed. David felt disappointed. In nightfall that day, David suddenly told me excitedly on phone that he had been employed. Greatly surprised, I asked him, \\"What's the whole matter?\\" David told me that he received another text saying that he was employed. David felt very confused about it. Later he found out the first text sent to him was also part of the test in the interview. Three men received the same text this morning and only David's reply was satisfying to the company. I asked my son, \\"How did all of you reply?\\" My son said, \\"One did not reply. The other said \\"goodbye\\" and I said \\"thank you\\".\\" Only then did I know that my son's \\"hope\\" came in that way. That is, when you feel disappointed, do not forget to say \\"Thank you\\" to the one who disappoints you. Actually, it is a piece of cake to say \\"Thank you\\".

On Christmas Eve, the submarine USS Copperfin, under the command of Captain Cassidy, departs San Francisco on a secret mission. At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain. Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction. As the submarine nears Tokyo Bay, the Copperfin has to negotiate its way through protective minefields and anti-torpedo nets. When a Japanese ship enters the bay, Cassidy follows in its wake. That night, a small party, including the ship's womanizer, \\"Wolf\\" (John Garfield), goes ashore to make weather observations. Meanwhile, Tommy is diagnosed with appendicitis. \\"Pills\\", the pharmacist's mate, has to operate following instructions from a book, using improvised instruments, and without sufficient ether to last throughout the procedure. The operation is a success, and \\"Cookie\\" Wainwright begins to prepare the pumpkin pie he had promised to bake for Tommy. Answer:","completion":"During the mission of the submarine USS Copperfin, crew member Mike is killed. The incident occurs when the submarine is attacked by two Japanese planes. Both planes are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. As Mike approaches to pick up the pilot from the water, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but his delayed reaction leads him to blame himself for Mike's death.

The cruel plant manager abandons the newborn in a dumpster. A local woman, named Luda Mae Hewitt, discovers the baby while searching for food. She names the infant Thomas and takes him to the Hewitt residence and raises the baby as her own son.Over the next 30 years, Thomas (Andrew Bryniarski) grows up and goes to work in the same slaughterhouse. When its horrid conditions cause the closure of his workplace, Thomas comes back and kills the slaughterhouse's owner with a sledgehammer; he also finds and takes a chainsaw. Charlie Hewitt (R. Lee Ermey), Luda Mae's (Marietta Marich) sadistic son, learns from Sheriff Winston Hoyt (Lew Temple) what Thomas has done, and accompanies the Sheriff to arrest Thomas. When they find Thomas, Charlie kills the Sheriff with a shotgun and takes his identity. Charlie and Thomas take the Sheriff's body home and butcher him for stew meat, telling the rest of the family that they will not leave their home even as the rest of the area becomes deserted.A few months later, in July 1969, two brothers, Eric (Matthew Bomer) and Dean (Taylor Handley), drive across the country with their girlfriends Chrissie (Jordana Brewster) and Bailey (Diora Baird). Eric and Dean are draft dodgers and are plotting to flee north to avoid being drafted into the U.S. Army where they will be sent to Vietnam. They stop at a local eatery where they encounter a group of bikers. As the group pulls away, a female biker, Alex (Cyia Batten), follows them. A chase ensues, ending with the group crashing into a cow and flipping their car. In the process, Chrissie gets thrown from the car and lands in the weeds, out of sight of the others.

Q: Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'. Watch out for Fake product on this card even though they are sold by Amazon<br /><br />I ordered one of these cards based on the good reviews on the product. Amazon shipping was prompt as always. The Card arrived in its original Asus packaging. The first thing that i noticed was that the package seemed to be sealed differently with a long tape instead of shrink wrap or circular seal. Another suspicious thing that was noticed was that there was a sticker over the UPC number. But the card seemed to be as described from its looks. I went ahead and installed it in the system and the first thing that was noticed was that the card does not install on the motherboard since the CPU fan was hitting against the BIOS battery. I then went ahead and reviewed the diagrams on the card and it looked like the heatsink was mounted incorrectly, so went ahead and remounted the heat sink turning it around 180 degrees and now it fits properly on the motherboard. Further all installations went smoothly and the system properly booted up.<br />So my thoughts at that point was that this was a quality control issue with ASUS. After installing Windows 8.1 everything seemed to be working fine. I then went ahead and installed the driver from ASUS and it seemed to go smoothly. The system asked for a reboot and now windows started complaining that the driver for the video card is outdated and wanted to update it, and this is when i noticed that the card detected was a 6670 instead of 7250 which is one generation older.<br />I then went to AMD site and downloaded the driver and even that was detecting the card as a 6670 instead of 7250. I decided to get more in-depth into this and started reviewing the card in detail and that is when i noticed that the card i received had a different mounting plate than what was given in the ASUS site and video outputs were all in the wrong places.<br />Called up Amazon and they agreed to send a replacement by next day air. So hoping that the replacement card that i get will not be a fake one again.

In this review, the customer faced several issues, such as receiving a product with a different manufacturing seal and incorrect heatsink mounting. Additionally, the video card was detected as one generation older than the advertised model, leading them to suspect that it was a fake product.

Summarize this article: Keep the magazines you collect or want to reread at a later time. Set aside magazines with helpful information to come back to later. Then, recycle any magazines you no longer need. This will eliminate extra clutter from your home so your magazines will be organized and easy to access! If you prefer to keep things organized in alphabetical order, then arrange your issues by title so the magazines that start with “A” are on the left side, and the magazines starting with “Z” are on the right. Then, place your magazines in their appropriate place in between. If you have many magazines on the same subject, such as scrapbooking, cooking, or bodybuilding, then organize them categorically. For example, if you are looking for a new recipe for dinner, you can easily go to the “Cooking” section and locate an issue. File holders are small boxes or racks that allow you to display files, or in the case, magazines, vertically. After you choose your organizational method, put your magazines into the holders accordingly. You can fit 8-12 magazines in a standard file holder, depending on the thickness of your copies. For example, if you have many craft magazines and you want to organize them thematically, put all your craft magazines in the same holder. After you place all of your magazines in their respective holders, you should label them so you can easily locate individual issues. Write the name of the magazine, and include the issue numbers if you'd like. You can write directly onto your magazine holders with a permanent marker, or use sticker labels and adhere them to the front of your holders. If you want to use a label maker, turn on your machine and type in the title of your label, such as \\"Animals.\\" Then press \\"Print\\" to create your label. Peel off the backing and stick your label onto your file holder. You can situate the file holders anywhere you like. Keeping them on a bookcase is a great way to keep them organized and easily accessible. You could also store them in closet, on shelves, or even in a storage area like a basement or attic. Summary:","completion":"To organize your magazines effectively, first keep the ones you want to reread or have helpful information and recycle the rest.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does \\"The latter is further divided into humoral (or antibody) and cell-mediated components.\\" correctly answer the question of What is one type of adaptive immune system component?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The latter is further divided into humoral (or antibody) and cell-mediated components.\\" correctly answers the question of what one type of adaptive immune system component is by briefly mentioning the two primary components: humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity and cell-mediated immunity. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, let us delve into these components further. The adaptive immune system, also known as acquired immunity, is a highly specialized component of our overall immune system that is responsible for targeting and eliminating specific pathogens. It has the unique ability to \\"remember\\" past infections and respond more effectively to the same pathogens if they ever encounter them in the future. There are two main branches of the adaptive immune system: humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity. 1. Humoral immunity (antibody-mediated immunity): This branch of adaptive immunity deals with the production of antibodies specific to a particular pathogen. Antibodies are produced by B-cells, a type of white blood cell, after they encounter a foreign antigen (a substance recognized as foreign by the immune system). When B-cells encounter an antigen, they mature into plasma cells, which produce and release antibodies into the bloodstream. These antibodies can then neutralize the pathogen by binding to the antigenic sites, preventing the pathogens from attaching to host cells and facilitating their destruction by other immune cells. A key aspect of humoral immunity is its ability to provide long-term protection through the formation of memory B-cells. These cells can persist following an infection and respond more rapidly and effectively if the same pathogen is encountered in the future. 2. Cell-mediated immunity: This branch of adaptive immunity focuses on the direct interaction between immune cells and infected or cancerous cells. T-cells, another type of white blood cell, play a central role in cell-mediated immunity. There are several types of T-cells, including helper T-cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and regulatory T-cells, each contributing to distinct aspects of the immune response. Helper T-cells (Th) recognize specific antigens and orchestrate the overall immune response by activating other immune cells, including B-cells and cytotoxic T-cells. Meanwhile, cytotoxic T-cells (Tc) directly target and eliminate cells infected with viruses or other intracellular pathogens, as well as cancerous cells, by releasing molecules that trigger cell death. Lastly, regulatory T-cells (Tregs) help modulate the immune response, maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. In summary, the statement correctly answers the question by briefly mentioning humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity and cell-mediated immunity as the two primary components of the adaptive immune system. Each branch plays a crucial role in recognizing and eliminating specific pathogens while providing long-term protection through immune memory formation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: What is tributary? A tributary is a term used to describe a subsidiary river or stream that flows into a more extensive and more prominent river system. It is an essential part of hydrological systems, as tributaries contribute to the flow of water in rivers, affecting the overall volume, sediment transport, and nutrient content. Moreover, they play a vital role in supporting various ecosystems, habitats, and biodiversity. Characteristics of tributaries can vary according to their size, geographic location, direction, and the type of surrounding terrain and environment. For example, some tributaries can be small, intermittent water courses (only flowing during rainy seasons) while others are large, perennial rivers with a constant flow throughout the year. Furthermore, tributaries can originate from different sources such as glaciers, rain, or springs. The interaction between tributaries and main rivers influences a wide range of ecological processes, including sediment deposition, channel formation, nutrient conservation, and water circulation. In turn, these processes affect the quality of water, plant and animal life, and various dependent habitats such as wetlands, marshes, or estuaries. Tributaries are significant not only in terms of their ecological contribution but also their cultural, socioeconomic, and historical impact. Many ancient civilizations and cities developed along the banks of large rivers and their tributaries to take advantage of fertile lands, water resources, communication, and trade networks. Second question: What is a tributary? This question is essentially asking the same thing as the first question. It seeks to understand the meaning and concept of a tributary in the context of hydrology and river systems. The detailed answer provided above, explaining the importance, characteristics, and functions of tributaries, would be an apt response to this question as well. In conclusion, both questions are fundamentally inquiring about the same concept - understanding the nature and role of a tributary within a river system. The subtle difference in phrasing does not alter the subject matter or the intent with which these questions have been posed."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

In this task you will be given a list of integers. For every element in the list, if the element is even you should divide by 4, if the element is odd you should multiply by 4 then add 2. The output should be a list of numbers that is the result of applying that logic to the input list. You should not round any decimals in the output. Zero should be counted as an even integer. [80, -5, -19, -70, 4]","completion":"To solve this problem, I first analyzed the definition and determined the steps that needed to be taken. The definition states that for each element in the list, we need to apply certain operations depending on whether the element is even or odd. The output should be a new list containing the results of these operations applied to the input list. Here's the approach I took: 1. Create an empty list called 'output_list' to store the results. 2. Iterate through each element in the input list. 3. For each element, check whether it is even or odd. a. If the element is even, divide it by 4. b. If the element is odd, multiply it by 4, and then add 2. 4. Append the result from step 3 to the 'output_list'. 5. Once the iteration is complete, the 'output_list' will contain our final answer. Now, let's apply this approach to the given input: [80, -5, -19, -70, 4] 1. Create an empty list, 'output_list'. 2. Iterate through the input list. - For 80 (even): Dividing 80 by 4 results in 20. - For -5 (odd): Multiplying -5 by 4 and then adding 2 results in -18. - For -19 (odd): Multiplying -19 by 4 and then adding 2 results in -74. - For -70 (even): Dividing -70 by 4 results in -17.5. - For 4 (even): Dividing 4 by 4 results in 1. 3. Every time the operations are applied on an element, it is added to the 'output_list'. 4. At the end of the iteration, 'output_list' now contains the following values: [20, -18, -74, -17.5, 1] So, the final output is [20, -18, -74, -17.5, 1]."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What is the master gland of the endocrine system? A: OPTIONS: a). Thyroid. b). Hypothyroid. c). Thymus. d). pituitary gland. Answer:","completion":"The master gland of the endocrine system is the pituitary gland, as mentioned in the given paragraph. It is responsible for controlling other endocrine glands, thereby playing a crucial role in regulating the body's hormones and overall function. The pituitary gland, also known as the master gland, is a small, pea-sized structure located at the base of the brain. It is connected to the hypothalamus, which plays an essential role in linking the nervous and endocrine systems. The hypothalamus is responsible for triggering the release of hormones from the pituitary gland by secreting hormones that act on the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland comprises two distinct lobes: the anterior (front) lobe and the posterior (back) lobe. Each part of the gland releases various hormones that affect diverse processes in the body, including growth, reproduction, metabolism, thyroid function, and stress response. Other endocrine glands, including the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, pancreas, and gonads, are also part of the endocrine system. These glands release hormones that regulate specific physiological processes. For example, the thyroid gland synthesizes hormones that control metabolism, and the adrenal glands produce hormones like cortisol, which is involved in responding to stress. In summary, the master gland of the endocrine system is the pituitary gland (Option d). It controls other endocrine glands and plays a vital role in managing hormone release and regulation throughout the body. The hypothalamus works closely with the pituitary gland, ensuring a strong connection between the endocrine and nervous systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) is a political party in Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde that played a significant role in the fight for independence from Portuguese colonial rule in the 20th century. As the statement indicates, the PAIGC publicly acknowledged the execution of many Gueinean soldiers and their burial in unmarked collective graves in November 1980. The acknowledgment occurred through their newspaper, Nó Pintcha, on 29 November 1980. Nó Pintcha, a publication controlled by the party, was an instrument used by the PAIGC to disseminate information, shape public opinion, communicate party policies, and, in this case, reveal previously concealed actions. By admitting to these executions and their clandestine burial sites in the woods of Cumerá, Portogole, and Mansabá, the PAIGC took responsibility for the incidents, thereby providing an official date for when the acknowledgment took place. Consequently, the provided statement accurately answers the question of when the PAIGC acknowledged the executions, as it specifies both the year (1980) and the exact date (29 November 1980) of this acknowledgment, along with the manner in which it was made public (through their newspaper Nó Pintcha)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Hyundai CEO tells where he'll take his hot brand next John Krafcik, CEO of Hyundai Motor America since 2008, has overseen fantastic growth, and now he has a different challenge: Keep the pot boiling at a time when he can't count on the spotlight and dealer enthusiasm that come with monthly sales records. That's because Hyundai's rocket ride up the U.S. sales chart is over -- because it can't make cars any faster. Hyundai is hitting full production capacity in South Korea, where most models sold in the U.S are made, and is adding a third shift this month at its Montgomery, Ala., plant that builds its two highest-volume U.S. models, Sonata and Elantra. VIDEO: Five questions with John Krafcik Much of the momentum Krafcik inherited was his own doing. Before he became CEO, Krafcik was vice president of product development and strategic planning. When he took that job in 2004, Hyundai's share of U.S. new vehicle sales was 2.5%, according to Autodata. Now, it's 5% and Hyundai is the seventh-biggest car company in the U.S., ranked by sales, behind the Detroit Three and Japan's top trio, Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Krafcik is sure the production limits will give his rivals advantages, especially in the midsize sedan segment, where seemingly every brand has a new model or soon will. \\"Competitors will take some demand away\\" from the Hyundai Sonata, but he professes himself \\"comfortable\\" with the sales he expects to get. And like all successful sales folk, he sees an opportunity in a limited supply: \\"I'd rather be a little bit short on production and long on quality,\\" he says. Rushing to crank out ever more vehicles can cause quality shortcuts, Toyota Motor CEO Akio Toyoda explained in 2010 to a U.S. congressional committee probing the company's sudden acceleration complaints, \\"I fear the pace at which we have grown may have been too quick,\\" he testified, and it may have \\"confused\\" the company about its priorities. In a session with USA TODAY reporters and editors, Krafcik offered a peek at Hyundai's future beyond the explosive sales gains. He has some contrary notions that'll keep Hyundai a very interesting company to watch. What's in Krafcik's crystal ball, on big issues and some not so big: Hyundai will field some alternative-power models -- already it is selling a gasoline-electric hybrid version of the Sonata, and a hydrogen-fueled car is due in 2015, he says -- but the future belongs to the venerable gasoline engine. It \\"will still be the majority (powerplant) in 30 years,\\" he says. Refined, evolved, downsized, engineered to a fare-thee-well, for sure, but still the recognizable internal combustion engine traceable to the first practical car, built by Karl Benz in 1886. Even Hyundai's hydrogen car won't be exclusively an alternative fuel model. \\"It would be a platform where we could also put in internal-combustion\\" engines. Nowadays the politically correct view is that non-petroleum power is the future. Nonetheless, others agree with Krafcik. One school of thought says that bio-fuels made from waste -- cornstalks or wood chips, for instance, instead of feed corn as is done now -- eventually could be produced in such quantities that they could be sold at the pump cheaper than gasoline. \\"Suddenly you have the same old engines but new environmentally acceptable fuels, and it's a whole new game,\\" says David Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Auto Research and longtime observer of the auto industry. A report this month from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says lifetime costs associated with electric cars are \\"generally higher than those of a conventional vehicle or traditional hybrid of similar size and performance.\\" On average, CBO says, costs run 16,000 to 19,000 more than a comparable gas-engine vehicle. The CBO report says that an electric or plug-in hybrid would \\"require a tax credit of more than 12,000 to have the same lifetime costs\\" as a similar gas-only vehicle. The government currently gives a federal tax credit up to 7,500 for electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles for qualifying buyers. Hyundai was a pioneer of four-cylinder power when it introduced the redesigned 2011 Sonata midsize sedan only with four-cylinder engines, dropping the V-6 option. They are more sophisticated fours that use high-tech direct fuel injection for both better mileage and more power -- even though the technology is costlier and noisier. Direct injection is making its way into the mainstream, but when Sonata was launched it was mainly a premium-brand feature. \\"Four-cylinders are absolutely the future,\\" Krafcik says. Sonata's main rivals, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima, all still have optional V-6s, though Ford and General Motors are following the lead with only fours in the 2013 redos of their Ford Fusion and Chevrolet Malibu. \\"The Japanese have their V-6s because they don't have the turbo fours ready. They fell behind\\" in engine development, says Aaron Bragman, senior analyst at consultant IHS Automotive. Hyundai still has V-6s in the long-wheelbase version of its Santa Fe SUV, as well as V-6s and V-8s in its upscale Genesis and Equus models. Don't expect that to change immediately. In fact, the Genesis coupe got a more-powerful V-6 as part of its 2013-model update. Unique cars for unique markets \\"We don't believe in one-car-for-the-world, as some of our competitors do,\\" says Krafcik. \\"We view the American market as different from the European market. Rear-seat packaging (for example) is more important in the U.S.\\" That puts him head-on against his old employer, Ford Motor, which has pushed hard for uniform global designs in its One Ford strategy. That makes it possible to build any car at any of its factories around the world and requires only relatively small changes to suit various markets. Thus, it is cheaper and quicker to get models to market. Cars as mobile Internet connections This is one area where Krafcik agrees with the prevailing notions in the industry. \\"Moving nodes,\\" he calls cars of the future, and it's happening fast. Mazda claims that as part of its Skyactiv suite of technologies, it will cut vehicle weight 7% each time it renews a model. Hyundai cut about that much from the Santa Fe SUV in the redesign for 2013, from 3,725 down to 3,459 pounds. Lighter cars take less energy to move, so use less fuel. They also let automakers use smaller, lighter components, such as brakes and suspension parts. If the government's new fuel-economy standards remain set for 54.5 mpg in 2025, lightening will be increasingly important. Ford is believed to be planning an aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup for launch in 2014, which would cut about 700 pounds, or 15%, from the current model. Names for vehicles, not letters or numbers \\"We're not believers in alphanumerics,\\" he says. The industry has moved toward such designations as a mark of prestige. Lincoln MKZ, Cadillac XTS and Acura RDX, for example. Mainstream brands are sticking with names, such as Sonata, Malibu, Fusion, Altima and Optima. Shifting Hyundai from a low-price nameplate Hyundai is \\"making the transition from a value brand to a valuable brand,\\" he says. So the Elantra compact offers a heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, back-up camera and other features generally reserved for bigger, higher-priced cars. Of course, an Elantra compact so-equipped has a midsize price: 25,000. That's bad news for bargain-hunting car shoppers, but probably inevitable -- features or not -- as a result of Hyundai's maxed-out production. Anything in short supply gets more expensive. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are that John Krafcik, CEO of Hyundai Motor America, has overseen significant growth for the company during his tenure. However, Hyundai now faces production capacity limits in South Korea and must add a third shift at its Montgomery, Alabama plant to meet demand. Though alternative-power models are being developed, Krafcik believes that the gasoline engine will still dominate the market in 30 years. Four-cylinder engines are considered the future, with Hyundai leading the charge with its four-cylinder-only redesigned 2011 Sonata. Hyundai also does not believe in a one-car-for-the-world strategy and prefers to tailor models to suit different markets. Additionally, lighter cars are seen as a trend to keep an eye on for improving fuel efficiency, and Hyundai aims to become a \\"valuable brand\\" by offering high-end features on its vehicles while maintaining their competitive pricing."},{"prompt":"Q:- native name lang is mk - native name is Бранко Црвенковски - president is boris gligorov trajkovski ljupčo jordanovski kiro gligorov stojan andov kiro - successor is gorge ivanov radmila Šekerinska -lrb- acting -rrb- ljubčo georgievski - party is social democratic union - spouse is jasna crvenkovska - primeminister is radmila -lrb- acting -rrb- vlado bučkovski nikola gruevski Šekerinska -lrb- acting -rrb- hari kostov radmila Šekerinska - office is 3rd president of macedonia prime minister of macedonia - predecessor is boris trajkovski ljubčo georgievski nikola kljusev - term end is 12 may 2009 12 may 2004 30 november 1998 - term start is 12 may 2004 1 november 2002 17 august 1992 - birth date is 12 october 1962 - image is branko-crvenkovski . jpg - birth place is sarajevo , yugoslavia -lrb- now bosnia and herzegovina -rrb- - religion is macedonian orthodoxy - alma mater is saints cyril and methodius university of skopje Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

William James Dixon (July 1, 1915 - January 29, 1992) was an American blues musician, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record producer. He was proficient in playing both the upright bass and the guitar and was a capable singer, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to Muddy Waters, Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post-World War II sound of the Chicago blues. Dixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. Dixon left Mississippi for Chicago in 1936. A man of considerable stature, standing 6 and a half feet tall and weighing over 250 pounds, he took up boxing, at which he was successful, winning the Illinois State Golden Gloves Heavyweight Championship (Novice Division) in 1937. He became a professional boxer and worked briefly as Joe Louis's sparring partner, but after four fights he left boxing in a dispute with his manager over money. Dixon met Leonard Caston at a boxing gym, where they would harmonize at times. Dixon performed in several vocal groups in Chicago, but it was Caston that persuaded him to pursue music seriously. Caston built him his first bass, made of a tin can and one string. Dixon's experience singing bass made the instrument familiar. He also learned to play the guitar. In 1939, Dixon was a founding member of the Five Breezes, with Caston, Joe Bell, Gene Gilmore and Willie Hawthorne. The group blended blues, jazz, and vocal harmonies, in the mode of the Ink Spots. Dixon's progress on the upright bass came to an abrupt halt with the advent of World War II, when he refused induction into military service as a conscientious objector and was imprisoned for ten months. He refused to go to war because he would not fight for a nation in which institutionalized racism and racist laws were prevalent. After the war, he formed a group named the Four Jumps of Jive. He then reunited with Caston, forming the Big Three Trio, which went on to record for Columbia Records.

Answer: Wheat Question: what are the elements in whole grain oats Answer:","completion":"Whole grain oats contain three essential elements: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm. Let me provide a detailed explanation of each element: 1. Bran: The outer layer of the grain is known as the bran. It is rich in fiber, antioxidants, and various essential minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus. The bran provides numerous health benefits, including supporting digestive health and maintaining regular bowel movements. 2. Germ: The germ is the reproductive part of the grain, from which a new plant can grow. It is an abundant source of B vitamins, vitamin E, healthy fats, and several phytonutrients. The germ plays a vital role in providing energy, supporting metabolism, and promoting overall health. 3. Endosperm: The largest part of the grain is the endosperm, which surrounds the germ. It contains complex carbohydrates, proteins, and small amounts of vitamins and minerals. The endosperm provides essential nutrients for the growing plant, and our bodies use these nutrients for energy and tissue maintenance. In conclusion, whole grain oats are made up of the bran, germ, and endosperm, which together offer a variety of vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and proteins that contribute to a balanced diet and overall health. So, the answer to the question would be \\"Yes\\" for elements in whole grain oats being wheat and \\"Yes\\" for bran, germ, and endosperm being the elements in whole grain oats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'pozzillo lake' exhibits the relationship of 'lake inflows'. Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - rhine - salso","completion":"To find the entity to which 'Pozzillo Lake' exhibits the relationship of 'lake inflows', we need to examine the provided information in the paragraph about 'Pozzillo Lake'. The one critical piece of information relevant to this query is the location of Pozzillo Lake, which is stated to be in the Province of Enna, Sicily, Southern Italy, specifically in the Erean Mountains chain. This lake is primarily located in the comune of Regalbuto, but it also partially belongs to Agira. However, the description does not clearly state which river flows into Pozzillo Lake. So, we need to look into the other information presented to find a potential link. From the first piece of information about Agira, we can observe that it is located in the mid-valley of the River Salso. Given that Agira shares a location with Pozzillo Lake according to the fourth piece of information, it's most probable that the River Salso is the inflow for Pozzillo Lake. Therefore, considering the information provided, 'Salso' river is the entity with which 'Pozzillo Lake' exhibits the relationship of 'lake inflows'. The option 'Rhine' is not relevant since the Rhine is a river in France (mentioned in the piece of information about France), and there is no link to Pozzillo Lake. To sum up, the answer is 'Salso'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

A former policeman stabbed his estranged wife to death at her hair salon in front of her horrified teenage colleague. In the months before her killing, Ivan Esack, 38, had chillingly told Natalie, 33, ‘You’re a dead woman walking – tick tock, tick tock’, a court heard yesterday. He eventually fulfilled his alleged threat by knifing her up to 11 times in an attack that was so ferocious the blade bent. Murder case: Ivan Esack, 38, knifed Natalie Esack, 33, at Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, in April up to 11 times with such ferocity that the blade bent and the tip broke off, Maidstone Crown Court was told. Mrs Esack’s 17-year-old salon. assistant Chelsea Ford wept as she told how after the killing, Esack. strode out on to the High Street, saying: ‘She deserved it, the bitch.’ Prosecutor Philip Bennetts described. Esack as ‘a violent and controlling person who was unable to deal with. the separation from his wife’ and killed her because he did not want her. to be with anyone else. The court was told of this chilling exchange between Esack and his wife on the day before her death. Tragedy: Floral tributes left at the scene of the stabbing at Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, in May. Esack: ‘I’ll catch up with you, don’t worry. You can’t ****ing hide from me, can you?’ Natalie: ‘What are my options?’ Esack: ‘Death, death or death. You will see in the morning, and what I’m going to ****ing do to you won’t be funny.’ Cocaine-user Esack admits stabbing. his wife but denies murder, claiming he is guilty only of manslaughter. while his mind was unbalanced by ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ and. ‘substance abuse’. On location: Esack Hair and Beauty is pictured on Ashford High Street in Kent. As Ivan Esack strolled into the salon armed with the knife, his wife was on a computer at reception, the court heard. Maidstone Crown Court heard Esack and. his wife met around ten years ago and married in 2006. She later opened. Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, and counted Nancy Sorrell, 37,. wife of comedian Vic Reeves, among her clients. Although she ran her own. business, Mrs Esack’s husband was bullying and controlling, the jury. heard – never allowing his wife out without knowing where she was. One Christmas a few years ago she. suffered a badly swollen cheek and eye, Mr Bennetts said, after her. husband punched her. In July last year Mrs Esack told a relative he had. threatened her with a knife. Investigations: Forensic police officers take away the body of Natalie Esack from Esack Hair and Beauty in April. In October last year Mrs Esack left. the marital home and went to live with her brother. Mr Bennetts said. Esack then made such frightening threats to use his legally-held shotgun. to kill his wife, himself, and their dog, that she called the police. Esack voluntarily handed over the gun but continued with his abuse and threats, the court heard. During the separation, Mrs Esack. began a new relationship but just before last Christmas was persuaded to. return to her husband after he broke down crying. On Boxing Day, she went on a. make-or-break holiday to Mexico with Esack – but returned with a massive. bruise on her thigh, saying he had kicked her. The couple separated again and. abusive calls continued, the jury heard. Some were recorded by Mrs Esack. and were played in court. Esack was heard saying: ‘You’ve signed your. own death warrant’. Matters came to a violent end in. April after Mrs Esack went to a party with her new boyfriend and. accidentally called her husband. He heard the pair talking and became. aware of how serious her new relationship was. The next day, the court heard, he. bought a knife and went to her salon, stabbing his wife at the reception. desk. As she tried to flee, he grabbed her and continued to knife her. in the back. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This is a really sad and scary story. It's about a man named Ivan Esack who used to be a policeman. He was really mean and hurtful to his wife, Natalie. They were not living together anymore, but he was still very angry. One day, he went to the place where Natalie worked and hurt her really badly with a knife, so badly that she died. Before this, he had said some very mean things to her and even threatened her. Ivan said that he wasn't thinking clearly because he was taking something called cocaine, a very bad substance that can make people act differently, and he also had a problem with his personality. However, he is now going through a trial where people like judges and lawyers are trying to find out if he did what he's accused of on purpose or if it was because of his problems. It's a really serious situation and still ongoing so we don't know the final result yet. Just so you know, hurting others or oneself is never a good thing, and might make people very sad. It's always better to ask for help and talk about our feelings, so we can solve our problems in a nice way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).\\", answer the following question.

While the given options might provide a partial explanation, it would be more informative to explore a broader range of possibilities. Here are some potential reasons why it might have taken you a few weeks to find someone attractive: 1. Developing familiarity: Sometimes, attraction does not happen instantly. As you get to know someone over time, their personality, interests, and values can become more appealing, leading you to feel attracted to them. 2. Physical appearance: It is possible that the person's physical appearance changed over the weeks, either due to a change in clothing, hairstyle, or overall grooming habits. This may have sparked your newfound attraction. 3. Emotional connection: It may have taken a while for an emotional connection to develop between the two of you. Emotional connections are often necessary for attraction to occur, and they tend to develop with time as you interact more with the person. 4. Shared experiences: Over the weeks, you may have gathered more shared experiences with this person, which can contribute to increased attraction. The more positive experiences you have with someone, the more likely you are to find them attractive. 5. Changing personal priorities: Your priorities could have changed over time, leading you to be more open to developing attractions. Initially, you may have been more focused on other aspects of life, such as work, hobbies, or relationships with friends. 6. Social influence: There may have been a change in how others perceive this person, and this may have influenced how you see them. For example, if others suddenly started to express their admiration for this person or found them attractive, you may have been influenced by their opinions and begun to see the same qualities in them. In conclusion, while the given options might be true in some cases, attraction is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that can be influenced by numerous factors, both internal and external. It is essential to consider the bigger picture and examine various possibilities when trying to understand why it took a few weeks to find someone attractive."},{"prompt":"Q:Pick one category for the following text.

And that way lay escape. Their sturdy little forms--ever so much shorter and thicker than the mooncalf herds--were scattered up the slope in a way that was eloquent of indecision.

Having never been to a Wienerschnitzel before I had to rely on the photos to show me what to expect. Saw the sauerkraut dog and had to order that, has mustard too, perfect way to eat a hot dog. Shakes were on sale, so i got a chocolate one. The shake was ok, it didn't make it back to the office, but not because it was 'awesome', it was because I was thirsty and that's all I had.

That is not what I got. I got a hotdog in a BUN, with about a teaspoon of sauerkraut that looked like it was dipped in mustard. Ok, so i'm used to the Costco hotdogs, where you can actually see the dog sticking out each side, so i was expecting as such.

Our equation is: 8 * k + 3 = 7 * k First, we'll see that there is a \\"k\\" on both sides of the equation. That means we can get all the \\"k's\\" on one side by subtracting the smaller one from the bigger one, like this: (8 * k) - (7 * k) + 3 = 7 * k - 7 * k Now, when we subtract 7 * k from both sides, we get: 1 * k + 3 = 0 Next, we want to get the \\"k\\" all by itself.

Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy\\" is translated to \\"Ulkomaanasiain, turvallisuus- ja puolustuspolitiikan valiokunnassa\\". In Finnish, the phrase \\"valiokunnassa\\" means \\"in the committee\\". Note that in Finnish, compound words are often merged into one continuous word, as seen with \\"ulkomaanasiain\\", \\"turvallisuus-\\", and \\"puolustuspolitiikan\\". - \\"we decided\\" is translated to \\"päätimme\\", which is the first person plural past tense form of the verb \\"päättää\\" (to decide). - \\"to devote\\" is translated to \\"omistaa\\", which means \\"to dedicate\\" or \\"to devote\\" in this context. - \\"an own-initiative report\\" is translated to \\"oma-aloitteisen mietinnön\\". Here, \\"oma-aloitteinen\\" means \\"own-initiative\\" and \\"mietintö\\" means \\"report.\\" - \\"to security and/or defence.\\" is translated to \\"turvallisuudelle ja/tai puolustukselle.\\" In this case, \\"turvallisuus\\" means \\"security\\" and \\"puolustus\\" means \\"defence.\\" The abbreviation \\"ja/tai\\" is used to represent \\"and/or\\", where \\"ja\\" means \\"and\\" and \\"tai\\" means \\"or\\" in Finnish. Therefore, the Finnish translation of the original English sentence is \\"Ulkomaanasiain, turvallisuus- ja puolustuspolitiikan valiokunnassa päätimme omistaa oma-aloitteisen mietinnön turvallisuudelle ja/tai puolustukselle.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Krum was the Khan of Bulgaria from sometime after 796 but before 803 until his death in 814. During his reign the Bulgarian territory doubled in size, spreading from the middle Danube to the Dnieper and from Odrin to the Tatra Mountains. His able and energetic rule brought law and order to Bulgaria and developed the rudiments of state organisation. - Nikephoros I or Nicephorus I , also Logothetes or Genikos ( Greek : , Nikphoros I , \`\` Bringer of Victory '' ; died July 26 , 811 ) , was Byzantine Emperor from 802 to 811 AD , when he was killed in the Battle of Pliska . A patrician from Seleucia Sidera , Nikephoros was appointed finance minister ( logothets tou genikou ) by the Empress Irene . With the help of the patricians and eunuchs he contrived to dethrone and exile Irene , and to be chosen as Emperor in her stead on October 31 , 802 . He crowned his son Staurakios co-emperor in 803 . His rule was endangered by Bardanes Tourkos , one of his ablest generals , who revolted and received support from other commanders , notably the later emperors Leo V the Armenian and Michael II the Amorian in 803 . But Nikephoros gained over the latter two , and by inducing the rebel army to disperse achieved the submission of Bardanes , who was blinded and relegated to a monastery . A conspiracy headed by the patrician Arsaber had a similar issue . Nikephoros embarked on a general reorganization of the Empire , creating new themes in the Balkans ( where he initiated the re-Hellenization by resettling Greeks from Anatolia ) and strengthening the frontiers . Needing large sums to increase his military forces , he set himself with great energy to increase the Empire 's revenue . By his rigorous tax imposts he alienated the favour of his subjects , and especially of the clergy , whom he otherwise sought to control firmly . Although he appointed an iconodule , Nikephoros as patriarch , Emperor Nikephoros was portrayed as a villain by ecclesiastical historians like Theophanes the Confessor . In 803 Nikephoros concluded a treaty , called the \`\` Pax Nicephori '' , with Charlemagne , but refused to recognize the latter 's imperial dignity . Relations deteriorated and led to a war over Venice in 806 -- 810 . In the process Nikephoros had quelled a Venetian rebellion in 807 , but suffered extensive losses to the Franks . The conflict was resolved only after Nikephoros ' death ,... - The Battle of Pliska or Battle of Vrbitsa Pass was a series of battles between troops, gathered from all parts of the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Nicephorus I Genik, and Bulgaria, governed by Khan Krum. The Byzantines plundered and burned the Bulgar capital Pliska which gave time for the Bulgarians to block passes in the Balkan Mountains that served as exits out of Bulgaria. The final battle took place on 26 July 811, in some of the passes in the eastern part of the Balkans, most probably the Vrbitsa Pass. There, the Bulgarians used the tactics of ambush and surprise night attacks to effectively trap and immobilize the Byzantine forces, thus annihilating almost the whole army, including the Emperor. After the battle, Krum encased Nicephorus's skull in silver, and used it as a cup for wine-drinking. This is one of the best documented instances of the custom of the skull cup. - The Balkan mountain range (Bulgarian and , Latin Serbian Stara planina, \\"Old Mountain\\"; ) is a mountain range in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula. The Balkan range runs 560 km from the Vrashka Chuka Peak on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia eastward through central Bulgaria to Cape Emine on the Black Sea. The highest peaks of the Balkan Mountains are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is Botev at 2,376 m, which makes the mountain range the third highest in the country, after Rila and Pirin. The mountains are the source of the name of the Balkan Peninsula. - Pliska (, romanized: \\"Plskov\\") is the name of both the first capital of the First Bulgarian Empire and a small town situated 20 km Northeast of the provincial capital Shumen. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - The First Bulgarian Empire (Old ) was a medieval Bulgarian state that existed in southeastern Europe between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. It was founded circa 681 when Bulgar tribes led by Asparukh moved to the northeastern Balkans. There they secured Byzantine recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube by defeating possibly with the help of local South Slavic tribes the Byzantine army led by Constantine IV. At the height of its power, Bulgaria spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea.

I will recall and analyze the historical context of the establishment of the US capital city. 2. Identify the state that donated the land occupied by Washington, District of Columbia. Step 1: The US capital city, Washington, District of Columbia (also known as Washington, D.C.), was established by the Residence Act of 1790, which was signed into law by President George Washington. The act authorized the creation of a capital district along the Potomac River, between the states of Maryland and Virginia. Step 2: Since the land occupied by Washington, D.C. was located along the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia, it can be determined that both Maryland and Virginia initially donated land for the establishment of the capital. However, the land donated by Virginia (the portion south of the Potomac River) was later returned to the state in the mid-19th century.

Here is a detailed and long answer on how to accomplish this goal: 1. Prepare the necessary ingredients and equipment: - Deer loin - Ziplock bags or airtight containers (for marinating) - Italian dressing - Your favorite jerky seasonings (e.g., salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, etc.) - A dehydrator with adjustable temperature control - Paper towels or clean kitchen towels (for drying the meat) 2. Defrost the deer loin: - Ensure you properly defrost the deer loin in the refrigerator. This process may take 12-24 hours, depending on the size of the loin. Place it on a tray or in a container to catch any drips and avoid cross-contamination. 3. Prepare the marinade: - In a bowl, combine the Italian dressing and your preferred seasonings. You can use a store-bought dressing or make your own by mixing olive oil, vinegar, oregano, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Experiment with different seasonings, such as red pepper flakes, brown sugar, soy sauce, or even pineapple juice, to create your desired flavor. 4. Trim and slice the deer loin: - Once the deer loin is fully defrosted, trim any excess fat or connective tissue. Slice the loin into thin strips, approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. This ensures the jerky will dry evenly and thoroughly. For a more tender jerky, slice against the grain. If you prefer a more chewy texture, slice the meat with the grain. 5. Marinate the deer loin: - Place the sliced deer loin strips in a Ziplock bag or airtight container. Pour the marinade over the meat, ensuring every piece is thoroughly coated. Seal the container or bag, removing any excess air. Place the container in the refrigerator and let the deer loin marinate overnight, or for at least 8-12 hours. The longer the marination, the more flavorful the jerky will be. 6. Preheat the dehydrator: - Before removing the marinated deer loin from the refrigerator, set up your dehydrator according to the manufacturer's instructions and preheat it to the meat setting, typically around 160°F (71°C). 7. Drain and pat the deer loin dry: - Remove the marinated deer loin strips from the refrigerator and drain off any excess marinade. Using paper towels or clean kitchen towels, pat the strips dry to remove excess surface moisture. This will help the jerky dehydrate more quickly and help achieve a consistent texture. 8. Arrange the deer loin strips in the dehydrator: - Place the dried deer loin strips in a single layer on the dehydrator trays, ensuring they do not touch or overlap. This allows for ample airflow and even dehydration. 9. Dehydrate the deer jerky: - Turn the dehydrator on and let it run until the deer jerky reaches your desired texture. This may take anywhere from 4 to 12 hours, depending on the thickness of the meat, your dehydrator, and personal preferences. Check the jerky periodically for doneness. It should be firm and leathery, yet bendable and easy to tear. 10. Cool and store the deer jerky: - When the jerky is done, remove it from the dehydrator and let it cool to room temperature on clean trays or a wire rack. Once cooled, store the jerky in an airtight container or plastic Ziplock bag for up to two weeks at room temperature, or freeze it for longer-term storage. By following these instructions, you will be able to create delicious homemade deer jerky that can be enjoyed as a nutritious, high-protein snack."},{"prompt":"Addison gave Bailey the advantage since it was her first time playing.

The Rai Coast languages are a family of languages in the Madang stock of New Guinea . Available choices: (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"(b). yes. Both sentences provided convey the same message with slightly different wordings and sentence structures, which makes them paraphrases. Paraphrasing involves rephrasing a statement or sentence while maintaining its original meaning. In this case, both sentences discuss the Rai coast languages as a family of languages situated in the Madang region of New Guinea. In the first sentence, \\"The languages of the Rai coast are a family of languages in Madang - continent of New Guinea,\\" the writer communicates the idea by specifically mentioning the territory of Madang and referring to the continent as New Guinea. This sentence uses a more explanatory approach by highlighting that these languages exist within a continent called New Guinea. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"The Rai Coast languages are a family of languages in the Madang stock of New Guinea,\\" establishes a similar meaning but with a slightly different structure. It uses the term \\"Rai Coast languages\\" instead of \\"languages of the Rai coast\\" and refers to the Madang region as the \\"Madang stock.\\" The message retains its core essence, signifying that the languages belong to a particular family within the Madang area of New Guinea.

On Friday, July 8, 2011, a family... (Associated Press) Mrs. Ford's death was confirmed by Marty Allen, chairman emeritus of the Ford Foundation. He did not comment further, and said he expected the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum would release information later. Betty Ford, whose husband, Gerald, died in December 2006, had undergone surgery for an undisclosed ailment in April 2007. During and after her years in the White House, 1974 to 1977, Mrs. Ford won acclaim for her candor, wit and courage as she fought breast cancer, severe arthritis and the twin addictions of drugs and alcohol. She also pressed for abortion rights and the Equal Rights Amendment. But it was her Betty Ford Center, a desert oasis that rescued celebrities and ordinary people from addiction, that made her famous in her own right. She was modest about that accomplishment. \\"People who get well often say, \`You saved my life,' and \`You've turned my life around,'\\" she recalled. \\"They don't realize we merely provided the means for them to do it themselves and that's all. \\"That's a God-given gift as far as I'm concerned. I don't take any credit for providing anything that wasn't provided to me.\\" After the former president died Dec. 26, 2006, at age 93, his widow said: \\"His life was filled with love of God, his family and his country.\\" They had been married in 1948, the same year he was elected to Congress. As she and their children led the nation in mourning him, Americans were reminded anew of her own contributions, as well as his. It was calculated then that the Betty Ford Center had treated 76,000 people. \\"It's hard to imagine a more important figure in the substance abuse field than Mrs. Ford,\\" Rick Rawson, associate director of the integrated substance abuse program at the University of California at Los Angeles, said at the time. She and her husband had retired to Rancho Mirage after he lost a bruising presidential race to Jimmy Carter in 1976. She went to work on her memoirs, \\"The Times of My Life,\\" which came out in 1979. But the social whirlwind that engulfed them in Washington was over, and Betty Ford confessed that she missed it. \\"We had gone into the campaign to win and it was a great disappointment losing, particularly by such a small margin,\\" she said. \\"It meant changing my whole lifestyle after 30 years in Washington, and it was quite a traumatic experience.\\" By 1978, she was addicted to alcohol and prescription drugs. She would later describe herself during that period as \\"this nice, dopey pill-pusher sitting around and nodding.\\" \\"As I got sicker,\\" she recalled, \\"I gradually stopped going to lunch. I wouldn't see friends. I was putting everyone out of my life.\\" Her children recalled her living in a stupor, shuffling around in her bathrobe, refusing meals in favor of a drink. Her family finally confronted her in April 1978 and insisted she seek treatment. She credited their \\"intervention\\" with saving her life. \\"I was stunned at what they were trying to tell me about how I disappointed them and let them down,\\" Ford told The Associated Press in 1994. \\"I was terribly hurt _ after I had spent all those years trying to be the best mother, wife I could be. ... Luckily, I was able to hear them saying that I needed help and they cared too much about me to let it go on, she said. She entered Long Beach Naval Hospital and underwent a grim detoxification, which became the model for therapy at the Betty Ford Center. She saw her recovery as a second chance at life. \\"When you come back from something that was as disagreeable and unsettling as my alcoholism, when you come back to health from that, everything is so much more valuable,\\" she said in her book, \\"A Glad Awakening.\\" Her own experience, and that of a businessman friend whom she helped save from alcoholism, were the inspiration for the center, located on the grounds of the Eisenhower Medical Center. She helped raise 3 million, lobbied in the state capital for its approval, and reluctantly agreed to let it be named for her. \\"The center's name has been burden, as well as honor,\\" she wrote. \\"Because even if nobody else holds me responsible, I hold myself responsible.\\" She liked to tell patients, \\"I'm just one more woman who has had this problem.\\" Her efforts won her a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, from the first President Bush in 1991. In October 1999: Gerald and Betty Ford both were awarded Congressional Gold Medals. She continued to be outspoken on public issues, pressing for fellow Republicans to be moderate on social questions. She spoke out in favor of gays in the military in a 1993 Washington Post interview, saying they had been serving for many years. During the Clinton presidency, Mrs. Ford praised first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying she had been with her at a meeting on health care and found her \\"courteous, charming, able, attractive. ... She asks good questions. She picked out one of the most demanding roles she possibly could.\\" In 2005, she was presented with the Gerald R. Ford Medal of Distinguished Public Service from her husband's foundation, telling the gathering that it was \\"very, very special.\\" She added in her typical candor: \\"It's kind of all in the family, and I feel a little guilty about it.\\" Mrs. Ford's first public appearance after her husband's death was in August 2007, when she attended a ceremony near Rancho Mirage as a postage stamp honoring the late president was issued. She did not speak. She had not traveled to Texas for the funeral of Lady Bird Johnson the previous month. Elizabeth Bloomer was born in Chicago on April 8, 1918, and raised in Grand Rapids, Mich. She was talented in dancing and ultimately studied with the great dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. She also worked as a model to make extra money during the Depression. With her gray-green eyes, chestnut hair and stately bearing, she was often described as regal. An early marriage to a furniture company representative, William Warren, ended in divorce before she met Gerald Ford, a lawyer just out of the Navy. When he proposed in 1948, she said later, she had no idea he planned a political career. \\"I really thought I was marrying a lawyer, and we'd be living in Grand Rapids,\\" she recalled. Then he announced his plan to run for Congress and even made a campaign appearance during their honeymoon. Political life was hard for her. While her husband campaigned or worked late on Capitol Hill, she raised their four children: Michael Gerald, born in 1950; John Gardner, born in 1952; Steven Meigs, born in 1956; and Susan Elizabeth, born in 1957. She said the pressure led her to consult a psychiatrist who told her \\"I shouldn't give up everything for my husband and my children, but had to think about what mattered to me.\\" The children were in their late teens and early 20s by the time the Fords moved into the White House and only Susan lived there. But they were a close family, gathering at Vail, Colo., for Christmas skiing vacations. \\"When I came to Washington, I saw my job as a supporting wife and mother,\\" Mrs. Ford said. \\"But I came to feel an emptiness in spite of the fact I was happy. The old term housewife just didn't seem right. That's when I looked for support in my thinking that there must be something more than that. And indeed there is.\\" She became an outspoken advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment, favored legal abortion and supported drafting women for the armed services. When asked on \\"60 Minutes\\" what she would do if her daughter, Susan, had an affair, she responded, \\"Well, I wouldn't be surprised. I'd think she was a perfectly normal human being. ... If she wanted to continue, I would certainly counsel and advise her on the subject.\\" Drawing on her dance background, she also helped foster interest in the arts during her time as first lady. She reconnected with her old teacher Graham, who remembered her as \\"very dedicated,\\" and Graham received the Medal of Freedom in a White House ceremony during the Ford years. When she underwent a radical mastectomy for removal of a cancerous breast, she kept no secrets, bringing the disease into the open. Thousands of women rushed to get breast examinations because of Ford's example. ___ Online: Betty Ford Center: http://www.bettyfordcenter.org/ Gerald Ford library and museum: http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/default.asp ||||| Betty Ford, the widow of late President Gerald Ford and a co-founder of an eponymous addiction center in California, has died at the age of 93, according to the director of the Gerald R.

One of the most widely accepted, commonly repeated assumptions in our culture is that if you exercise, you will lose weight. I exercise all the time, but I still have gut fat that hangs over my belt when I sit. Why isn't all the exercise getting rid of it? It's a question many of us could ask. More than 45 million Americans now belong to a health club, up from 23 million in 1993. We spend some 19 billion a year on gym memberships. Of course, some people join and never go. Still, as one major study -- the Minnesota Heart Survey -- found, more of us at least say we exercise regularly. And yet obesity figures have risen sharply in the same period: a third of Americans are obese, and another third count as overweight by the Federal Government's definition. Yes, it's entirely possible that those of us who regularly go to the gym would weigh even more if we exercised less. But like many other people, I get hungry after I exercise, so I often eat more on the days I work out than on the days I don't. Could exercise actually be keeping me from losing weight? The popular belief that exercise is essential for weight control is actually fairly new. As recently as the 1960s, doctors routinely advised against too much exercise, particularly for older adults who could injure themselves. Today doctors encourage even their oldest patients to exercise, which is sound advice for many reasons: People who regularly exercise are at significantly lower risk for all manner of diseases -- those of the heart in particular.

Given the question: - Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The last step of the process after the turbine spins is the generation and transmission of electricity to consumers. After the coal is burned in the boiler, steam is produced under high pressure. This high-pressure steam flows into a turbine, which is essentially a large wheel with numerous blades. As the steam comes into contact with the blades, it forces the turbine to rotate rapidly due to the transfer of kinetic energy. The spinning of the turbine generates mechanical energy, which needs to be transformed into electrical energy. This transformation is achieved through the use of an electrical generator, which is connected to the spinning turbine. The generator is designed to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, which is achieved through the process of electromagnetic induction. Within the generator, there are two essential components: a rotor (a rotating electromagnet) and a stator (stationary wires). As the rotor spins, it generates a magnetic field around the stator. The change in the magnetic field causes electrons within the stator to move, thereby producing an electric current. This electric current (or electricity) generated by the conversion process is then sent to substations, where transformers are used to adjust the voltage to levels appropriate for long-distance transmission. Once the voltage is adjusted, it is transmitted through high-voltage power lines to local distribution utilities. These utilities then distribute the electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers, who ultimately utilize the power for various purposes. It is important to mention that during this entire process, several measures are taken to minimize energy loss and ensure the efficiency of the power generation and transmission system. For instance, efforts are devoted to minimizing heat loss from the boiler, turbine, and generator, as well as optimizing the combustion of coal to generate the maximum amount of energy. Additionally, modern power plants are making use of technologies such as carbon capture and storage to reduce the environmental impact of burning coal. In summary, the last step of the process after the turbine spins is the generation of electricity through an electrical generator, followed by the transmission and distribution of electricity to various consumers who utilize it for their needs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: FRANKFURT — The market for luxury cars is recovering, but makers of the lower-priced cars that most people drive could struggle with meager profits for years to come. That was the message to be drawn from earnings reports released by Bayerische Motoren Werke and Volkswagen on Thursday. BMW said that its car division returned to profit in the fourth quarter of 2009, as sales stabilized in established markets and grew in emerging countries like China and Brazil. Soaring demand for higher-priced models like the top-of-line 7 Series contributed to the gains. For the full year, net profit at BMW beat expectations, falling 36 percent to €210 million, or 286 million. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had on average forecast a profit of €174 million. Sales fell 4.7 percent to €50.7 billion. Volkswagen also reported a profit for the year and record sales, confirming numbers first released early this month. But a closer look showed that its premium Audi unit accounted for almost all the operating profit of €1.9 billion, which was a 71 percent decline from 2008. Audi last week reported an operating profit €1.6 billion. That means Volkswagen’s volume brands, which also include Skodas from the Czech Republic and SEAT cars made in Spain, barely broke even, according to Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. “VW Group profit is based almost exclusively on the strength of Audi,” Mr. Dudenhöffer wrote in an analysis of the carmaker’s results. “VW Group’s volume brands are headed for a new cost problem.” If Volkswagen is racking up record unit sales but barely making money on small cars, the road to recovery looks longer than ever for other mass-market carmakers like General Motors and its Opel/Vauxhall unit, or Renault, both of which lost billions in 2009. The Volkswagen results are especially bad news for carmakers because the company, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, was considered among the healthiest in the industry, with strong market share in fast-growing developing countries and a broad portfolio of products, including 75 new or improved models last year alone. “Among the European carmakers Volkswagen is certainly the best-positioned globally,” said Georg Stürzer, an analyst at UniCredit in Munich. Including all its brands, Volkswagen sold more than 6.3 million cars and trucks in 2009, a 1.3 percent increase. But the value of those sales fell. Revenue at Volkswagen declined 7.6 percent to €105.2 billion, the company said. “We have to continue to work hard on our cost structures,” Hans Dieter Pötsch, the chief financial officer at Volkswagen, acknowledged in a statement. Few automakers are as strong in China or other emerging countries as Volkswagen, where car sales are expected to grow much faster than in Western Europe. VW sales in China soared 37 percent in 2009 to 1.4 million vehicles, more than VW sold in Germany. Sales abroad will help VW offset weak profit and underutilized assembly lines at home, Mr. Stürzer said, but “the others will not be able to do that.” Volkswagen said it expected to increase profit this year from last year, but warned that sales would not recover to 2007 levels until 2012. BMW is also turning to emerging markets for growth. It said sales in China grew 38 percent in 2009 and doubled in Brazil. Unit sales fell 20 percent in the United States last year, but BMW said that sales had already picked up this year. Particularly striking was the surge in sales of BMW’s most expensive cars. The 7 Series, which starts at €79,000 and tops out at more than €145,000 for a limousine version including rear seats with built-in massage, booked a 36 percent increase in sales to 52,680 cars. The X6 four-wheel-drive car and Z4 sports car also generated big sales increases, BMW said. Its car division, which also makes Rolls-Royces and Mini small cars, was unprofitable for the first nine months of 2009, but returned to an operating profit of €93 million in the final quarter, BMW said. The company remained profitable overall during 2009 because of earnings from its financial services and motorcycle units. “We performed well in 2009 despite difficult market conditions worldwide,” Norbert Reithofer, the automaker’s chief executive, said in statement. BMW came through the financial crisis better than rivals like Daimler, the maker of Mercedes cars, because it cut manufacturing capacity early in 2008 and did not build up large inventories of unsold vehicles. The company has said that it expected sales to improve later this year as it rolled out new models like the redesigned BMW 5 Series and four-wheel-drive Mini Countryman. BMW said Tuesday that unit sales of all its automobile brands rose 14 percent in February from a year earlier, to 92,000 vehicles. In 2009, BMW sold almost 1.3 million cars including the Mini and Rolls-Royce, a 10.4 percent decline from 2008. The company said it would pay an unchanged dividend of 30 cents for every common share and 32 cents for preferred shares. BMW shares rose 1 percent in Frankfurt trading, while Volkswagen’s preferred shares rose 3 percent after the company said it would not sell as much new stock to finance acquisitions as investors had feared.

Possible A: garden, yard, southern europe, rice paddy, house Why is \\"garden\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Garden\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. First, the context provided in the question suggests that the subject is focusing on an outdoor space connected to her living area. A terrace is an outdoor space designed for various uses like relaxation, leisure, and even gardening activities, often found adjacent to or within a garden. Second, when the statement mentions the terrace being covered in green next year, it implies that the area will have plants, shrubs, or other greenery, which are common features of a garden. A garden is a cultivated plot of land with a variety of plants, flowers, and other vegetation, making it a logical choice for the desired outdoor space. Furthermore, the statement refers to this space as the final piece of her dream. This implies that the outdoor space holds great significance and is an essential element of the individual's ideal living arrangement. A garden, with its lush greenery, vibrant flowers, and aesthetic appeal, is often seen as a significant and desirable component of a home. In comparison to the other possible answers: - A yard is a general term for an open outdoor space and might not necessarily focus on the greenery aspect desired. - Southern Europe is a geographical region and doesn't align with the context regarding an outdoor space around a house. - A rice paddy is a specific type of agricultural field for rice cultivation, which doesn't make sense within the context given. - A house represents the entire living space, but the question specifically points to an outdoor component of the property.

Susie contends with the ups and downs of life, from driving on fast-moving roadways, to finding a suitable parking space amid the many other automobiles out there.But as time goes on, Susie begins to feel her age. When she becomes too much for her original owner to handle, she is sold to a used car lot. Her second owner is rather uncouth, and her new journey in life takes her down back-alleys in the dead of night.One evening, a stranger carjacks Susie, and the incident ends in her colliding with a streetcar. Now a wreck, she's towed to the junk yard. However, just when her life seems at an end, a young teenager buys her from the junk yard, and gives her a second life as a sleek and fast little hot rod. Answer:","completion":"Susie is the titular character in the movie \\"Susie the Little Blue Coupe,\\" where she is a blue coupe automobile with a tan-cloth top. The film narrates her journey as an anthropomorphized car, experiencing the various stages of her life that many cars go through. Beginning as a brand-new model in an automobile showroom, Susie catches the eye of her first owner and embarks on her adventures through various challenges and landscapes. Throughout the movie, Susie learns to navigate the fast-paced world of automobiles, dealing with traffic on congested highways and searching for parking spaces in crowded lots. However, her journey mirrors the natural progression of life and the aging process as she eventually starts to feel the wear and tear of time. As Susie becomes too old and cumbersome for her original owner to maintain, she is sold to a used car lot, marking a significant change in her life. Susie's second owner proves to be rather uncouth, and her new phase of life subjects her to rougher experiences, such as driving down dark alleys late at night. One ominous evening, Susie falls victim to a carjacking, which results in a collision with a streetcar. Now a wreck, Susie finds herself in a junkyard, and it appears that her story has come to a tragic conclusion. However, this is not the end for Susie the Little Blue Coupe.

The result was a second consecutive victory for Constantine Karamanlis and his National Radical Union party , which won 171 of the 300 seats in Parliament . - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - The National Radical Union ((), \\"Ethnik Rizospastik Énsis\\" (ERE)) was a Greek political party formed in 1955 by Konstantinos Karamanlis, mostly out of the Greek Rally party. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Greek Rally ((), \\"Ellnikòs Synagermós (ES)\\") was a right-wing political party in Greece. Founded on 6 August 1951 by former field marshal Alexandros Papagos, the party encompassed a broad spectrum of the royalist conservative elements in Greek society and was modelled on the Charles de Gaulle's Rassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF). Throughout the years, the Greek right had become splintered. Papagos' new party managed to attract considerable support, and the Populist Uniting Party (led by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and Stephanos Stephanopoulos) and the New Party (led by Spiros Markezinis) dissolved and merged with the Greek Rally. Later on, a large portion of the People's Party, the major right-wing party of the prewar era, defected to the Greek Rally; among the prominent defectors was Konstantinos Karamanlis.

People: While people can cause rocks to have less friction by handling and shaping them, it is less likely that this process is as widespread as natural phenomena like water or wind. C).

Article: Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Paula Deen’s longtime powerhouse publicist, Nancy Assuncao, has quit after six years over the butter-loving chef’s plan to plug a diabetes drug. Assuncao faithfully stuck with Deen through years of hearty drama, including her battle with rival chef Anthony Bourdain, who called her “the most dangerous woman in America.” But she quit as Deen’s spokeswoman and chief marketer last month as Deen negotiated her deal to hawk the drug Victoza. Deen, now under siege by diabetics, nutritionists and fellow chefs for keeping her own Type 2 diabetes secret for three years, even as she pushed recipes full of sugar and fat, probably could use Assuncao’s help now. Deen only revealed her diagnosis last week. A source said Assuncao “strongly disagreed with Deen’s dramatic turnabout, after years of promoting fatty foods, to announcing she has a deal with a diabetes drug company [Novo Nordisk] and will be promoting lighter food and ‘diabetes in a new light.’ “While Paula did tell some people at her live appearances about her diabetes, she certainly didn’t talk about it on her show. Nancy disagreed with Paula’s plan to be a drug-company spokesman and challenged her decision. But this wasn’t a battle Nancy felt she was going to win. She couldn’t be part of it.” Assuncao, whose past clients have included Ian Schrager, told us last night, “I’m very grateful for the six years that I worked with Paula in helping her build the Deen brand. “Although we had a great deal of fun along the way, I could not agree with the new business strategy going forward. Nonetheless, I wish them continued success.” Deen’s new rep could not be reached last night, with a staffer at her office telling us, “She is on the Paula Deen cruise.” The chef’s Web site said Celebrity Cruises’ Eclipse would be a “tasty journey” in the Caribbean with a group buffet dinner, a cooking demo and a personal photo with Deen (one per family). ||||| Let Food Network chefs plan what's for dinner, with quick and easy recipes delivered to your inbox daily.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. Upon this point I cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. However, what I can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; Let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun! OK..so I must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book character? Or perhaps is there STILL unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series? The point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm! Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. Also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite Michael Berryman. Best scene? Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! Also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  Priceless!

Summarize this article: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders walks the picket line with Verizon protesters in New York on Wednesday, April 13. Verizon and the unions have been talking since last June over the company's plans to cut healthcare and pension-related benefits over a three-year period. (Reuters) NEW YORK — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made two shows of solidarity with labor unions, picking up the endorsement of the local Transport Workers Union and rallying with Communications Workers of America members who are on strike against Verizon. The presidential candidate, who has spent days rallying voters and CWA shop stewards in New York, started off at the Brooklyn offices of TWU Local 100. In 2008, its national organization endorsed John Edwards, then Barack Obama. This time, said the union's president, John Samuelsen, members realized that “business-as-usual politics is not going to give us the jolt we need” and got behind Sanders. “We all know in this room that you don’t have a great and growing middle class unless you have a great and growing trade union movement,” Sanders said. “And it is no secret that there have been fierce attacks against the trade union movement for the last number of decades, and in fact, you could argue that it is the trade unions of today that are the last lines of defense against a vicious corporate agenda that is working hard to destroy the middle class.” [Verizon’s workers on strike after impasse over contract talks] At times during the endorsement event, a few boisterous members of the union tried to start a chant: “Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, 2016 is Bernie time!” When he wrapped, Sanders was swarmed by supporters, including one who told him to “kick some a—“ in the April 19 New York primary. “I believe we're gonna win here in New York City, and we're gonna win here in New York state,” Sanders said. Leaving through a back door, Sanders headed to a Verizon protest on Flatbush Avenue. Surrounded by Secret Service agents and moving briskly from his motorcade to a speech site, Sanders was followed for three blocks by a man who kept shouting “I love you, Bernie!” Asked if he was “excited” to be there, Sanders turned the subject immediately to the workers’ grievance. “This is about a company that wants to take health-care benefits away from its workers, but somehow they have enough money to pay 20 million a year,” Sanders said. “These workers are standing up against injustice, and I stand with them.” A cheer went up as Sanders approached the protest. “We’ve got a champion who’s fighting for us,” said Christopher Shelton, CWA’s president. “Bernie Sanders!” Addressing the strikers as “brothers and sisters,” Sanders again condemned Verizon for its chief executive's pay and reluctance to pay the benefits the union had asked for. “This is just another major American corporation trying to destroy the lives of working Americans,” Sanders said. “Today you are standing up not just for Verizon workers; you’re standing up for millions of Americans who don’t have a union … on behalf of every worker in America, who is facing the same kind of pressure: Thank you. We’re gonna win this thing!” Sanders left the stage, pausing briefly for photos, then working a makeshift ropeline — actually a metal gate — with more than his usual aplomb. A few minutes later, he was back in the motorcade, with no more public events planned until a Wednesday night rally in Washington Square. Meanwhile, Sanders was declaring another kind of solidarity — with a trio of Democratic congressional candidates. They included Zephyr Teachout, an author, academic and surprisingly strong 2014 candidate for governor of New York who is now seeking a seat in the Hudson Valley. \\"When we talk about a political revolution, we also need to have people in Congress who aren't beholden to special interests,\\" Sanders wrote in his Teachout letter. \\"Zephyr literally wrote the book on political corruption. She understands better than anybody how special interests try to buy off politicians, and she's dedicated her life to fixing our broken political system.\\" Teachout, like Sanders, was in the midst of a solidarity rally with striking Verizon workers.

Proud to stand with CWA. #verizonstrike pic.twitter.com/H2jk2MB9iX — Zephyr Teachout (@ZephyrTeachout) April 13, 2016 ||||| Photo About 36,000 Verizon workers went on strike early Wednesday after the communications company failed to reach an agreement with unions representing workers for its wireline operations. Verizon has said that consumers will be mostly unaffected because it has trained thousands of nonunion employees since last year to fill in for those who walk the picket line. Union workers counter that the strike will impair Verizon’s ability to deliver quality customer service, including service calls and equipment installations. Here’s a guide to which consumers may be affected, who won’t and how any disruption might manifest itself. Which services will be affected? The unions generally represent workers for Verizon’s wireline operations, which include the company’s landline, high-speed Internet and television services. These services are mostly available only in the Northeast, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the region from southern New York to Virginia. Verizon offers home wireline services in parts of nine states, serving about 15 million phone lines. The unionized workers perform a range of tasks, like fixing a phone line that’s out of service, installing new phone and broadband Internet lines, or fielding customer support calls. Union workers say they plan to picket some Verizon Wireless stores, but only a small number of those employees are part of the unions. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In other words, subscribers to Verizon’s cellular phone and data services should not notice any changes. There should be no major difference when you call Verizon Wireless or go into a retail store with questions about your cellphone bill, data usage or upgrading to a new smartphone, for example. How might wireline services be affected by the strike? Verizon says consumers need not worry about the potential strike. “We went through very extensive, good training and we’re very confident that we’re more than ready to meet the needs of our customers,” said Raymond McConville, a Verizon spokesman. But judging from numbers alone, Verizon’s wireline customers can reasonably expect a deterioration in customer service quality. Even with preparation, the company said it had trained only upward of 10,000 employees to fill in for the nearly 36,000 workers who went on strike. In addition, many unionized workers who are striking have been doing this type of work for far longer than the one year that Verizon has trained nonunion workers to fill in. “There will almost certainly be some functions which may be slower or unavailable during the strike, because they require specialized skills or there just aren’t sufficient alternative resources available to fill all functions,” said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research. Why is Verizon tightening the belt on wireline services? Revenue for Verizon’s wireless business has grown healthily, whereas sales in its wireline business are shrinking slightly. For wireline services, Verizon focused on building out a strong customer base in the Northeast, but it sold its wireline assets in other states, including California, Florida and Texas. In other words, Verizon has a small, concentrated wireline business compared with its nationwide wireless service, and it is putting more money into wireless resources. How long could services be disrupted? Indefinitely. Verizon’s unionized workers have not specified how long they might go on strike, so it could last hours, days, weeks or even months. Will this affect my utility bill? Mr. McConville said the strike would have no effect on consumers’ bills. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) displayed solidarity with labor unions in New York as he gained the endorsement of the local Transport Workers Union and participated in a rally with Communications Workers of America (CWA) members who are striking against Verizon.

From this perspective, one could argue that it is plausible that Sonia may have struggled with overcoming the emotional and psychological barriers associated with playing baseball again. However, without further information about Sonia's recovery process, her emotional state, and her subsequent actions, it remains impossible to say for certain if the hypothesis is true.

Given these facts, what does a peachleaf willow do in the autumn among the following options: - staying warm - It expands - Die - Change colors - Fall over - Grow new flowers - flowers - spread flower seeds The answer is:","completion":"The peachleaf willow (Salix amygdaloides) is a deciduous tree species native to North America. It is a member of the Salicaceae family and is named for its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of a peach tree. As a deciduous tree, the peachleaf willow follows a seasonal lifecycle that involves shedding its leaves during autumn. Out of the given options, the answer is \\"Change colors.\\" In the autumn season, the peachleaf willow, like many other deciduous trees, undergoes a process wherein its leaves change color. This change is due to several factors – primarily, the decrease in sunlight hours and temperatures experienced during these months. As the amount of sunlight decreases, chlorophyll production begins to slow down. Chlorophyll is the pigment responsible for the green color of leaves and plays a critical role in photosynthesis, the process through which plants convert sunlight into energy. As chlorophyll levels drop, other pigments present in the leaves, such as carotenoids and anthocyanins, become more visible. These pigments are responsible for the yellow, orange, red, and purple hues commonly associated with autumn foliage. The gradual loss of chlorophyll in the leaves triggers a process called abscission. This process helps the tree remove its leaves efficiently to conserve energy and water during the colder months. Abscission starts with the formation of a specialized cell layer known as the abscission zone at the base of the leaf stem. As the cells in this layer gradually break down, the connection between the leaf and the tree weakens, eventually causing the leaf to fall off. The other options listed, such as staying warm, expanding, dying, falling over, growing new flowers, flowering, or spreading flower seeds, do not specifically apply to the peachleaf willow during the autumn season. These processes might either occur during other times in the tree's life cycle or not at all. In conclusion, a peachleaf willow's primary activity in the autumn season is that its leaves change colors. This occurs as a part of the tree's seasonal cycle and physiological adaptations to conserve energy and water during the colder months. The tree prepares to shed its leaves and enter a dormant state, resting until warmer temperatures and increased sunlight return in the spring."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The English term \\"public opinion\\" dates back to the seventeenth century work by John Locke, \\"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\\", which contains an early consideration of the importance of public opinion in the ordering of politics. The term was derived from the French word \\"l'opinion\\", which was first used in 1588 by Michel de Montaigne. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Krematorij (Russian \\"\\" - \\"Crematorium\\") is a Russian rock group. The group is considered one of the best concert performing teams in Russia, known for its masterly rock-n-roll. Formed in Moscow in 1983, Krematorij gained quick recognition, achieved the status of a legend of Russian Rock-n-Roll and after 30 years on stage continues to delight its audiences throughout the former Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Germany, Israel and the United States. The groups front man (and main song writer) is Armen Grigoryan. - Agon (Classical Greek ) is an ancient Greek term for a struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in chariot or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece. - Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - How to Find the Ideal ( Ukrainian : , Kak nayti ideal ) is a 2007 Ukrainian comedy directed by Vera Yakovenko and starring Armen Grigoryan .

Practical Pig, Fiddler Pig and Fifer Pig are three brothers who build their own houses with bricks, sticks and straw respectively. Practical Pig warns his brothers to build their house with \\"War Savings Certificate\\" bricks so that the house will be a solid defence against the marauding Wolf. Fifer and Fiddler ignore him and continue to play, singing \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\\". As they are singing, the Big Bad Wolf in Nazi swastika regalia, attacks the two spendthrifts, and blows Fifer's straw house down. Fifer manages to escape and hides at Fiddler's stick house but the Wolf also blows it down. The two pigs run and hide at Practical's brick house. The Wolf then tries to blow down the strong brick house (losing his clothing in the process), but is unable to make much progress as the bricks have made a strong foundation. Finally, Practical Pig chases the wolf away in a flurry of bricks that unerringly hit the Nazi marauder in his rear. The three pigs then sing \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\\" but with the caution that their house has to be in order to keep the wolf away.

The test flight fails as his right wing breaks, sending him crashing into the Seine River.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"(a).\\" sentiment (Options are: (a). negative; (b). positive;).","completion":"(a). Negative Title: 'Ocean's Desperation' Review: 'Ocean's Desperation' is a feeble attempt at creating an enthralling heist film that ultimately fizzles out, making it a disappointing watch for audiences. Directed by an amateur, who rather ironically drowns in the vast pool of clichés and plot holes, the film takes its inspiration from a number of previous heist films but never manages to steal the spotlight. The premise of the film centers around a ragtag group of criminals who band together to pull off a seemingly impossible robbery. While this initially sparks some intrigue, the weak and underdeveloped characters make it nearly impossible for the viewers to stay invested. Instead of sharing the thrill of a fast-paced, high-stakes crime, 'Ocean's Desperation' ultimately feels like a sluggish, monotonous slog. The performances by the ensemble cast leave much to be desired amid a convoluted plot ridden with unnecessary twists. The actors, much like the director, are unable to save the sinking ship of 'Ocean's Desperation', delivering stale and uninspired portrayals of their respective characters. This is further exacerbated by the weak dialogues, which lack the wit and punchiness that a good heist film demands. Moreover, the cinematography only serves to highlight the inadequacies of the production as a whole. It appears as though the camera work was done with little foresight or vision, resulting in scene after scene of disjointed and unengaging visuals that continuously distract from the plot's momentum. The biggest letdown of the film is its ending, which instead of providing a sense of resolution, inevitably leads to an eye roll. It aspires to shock the audience with one final twist, but the contrived nature of the attempt only adds to the movie's overall underwhelming impact. In conclusion, 'Ocean's Desperation' proves to be a desperate attempt at resurrecting a popular genre but falls devastatingly short. What could've been an exhilarating ride quickly becomes a tedious exercise in mediocrity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Consequently, we can conclude that \\"Not all of us agree about the way it is.\\" Human beings have diverse experiences, beliefs, and perspectives, which can often lead to differing opinions and views about certain matters. This is a natural part of human life, as people grow and develop their own ideas and ways of interpreting information. In situations where there is a lack of agreement or consensus, it can be helpful for individuals to engage in open and respectful dialogue, sharing their thoughts, and actively listening to others' points of view. This can foster understanding and may even lead to finding common ground or new ways of approaching the matter at hand. However, it is important to note that unanimity is not always possible or even necessary. People may still have differing opinions after a thorough discussion, and that is alright. What is crucial is to accept and respect others' viewpoints, even if they do not align with our own. In summary, the statement provided indicates that \\"Not all of us agree about the way it is.\\" This is a common situation in human interactions that can be addressed through open communication and respect for differing perspectives.

Soil protection plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy environment, sustainable agriculture, and the overall well-being of our planet. Several factors contribute to the significance of soil protection. Firstly, soil is a vital natural resource that provides essential nutrients, water, and air for the growth of plants. A diverse range of flora and fauna depend on the soil to survive, making it the foundation of ecosystems and biodiversity. By protecting soil, we also contribute to the preservation of various plant and animal species. Secondly, soil plays a significant role in maintaining water quality. Healthy soil can act as a filter, removing pollutants and reducing the contamination of water resources. This helps maintain clean water supplies for millions of people around the world, as well as preventing the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, soil protection aids in climate change mitigation. Soils can store immense quantities of carbon, acting as a carbon sink, which helps reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. When soil is degraded or eroded, stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Therefore, by safeguarding soil, we help combat global warming and its negative effects on the earth. Soil also plays a crucial role in food production and food security. Healthy soils enable farmers to grow nutritious and plentiful crops, which contribute to a stable global food supply. The loss of fertile soil through erosion, compaction, salinization, or other forms of degradation can severely impact agricultural productivity and threaten food security for millions of people. Moreover, soil protection contributes to the well-being of the economy. Soil conservation practices often result in increased agricultural yields and higher quality products, which in turn lead to economic growth. Additionally, protecting soil can help avoid the negative costs and consequences associated with soil degradation, such as the loss of arable land, increased flooding, and the necessary investments in remediation efforts. Overall, the protection of soil is vital for maintaining a healthy environment, preserving ecosystems and biodiversity, mitigating climate change, ensuring food security, and fostering economic growth. By valuing and prioritizing soil protection, we can contribute to a more sustainable future for our planet and future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Westlife were an Irish pop vocal group, formed in Dublin in 1998 and disbanded in 2012. Originally signed by Simon Cowell and managed by Louis Walsh, the group's line-up consisted of Nicky Byrne, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, Shane Filan and Brian McFadden, who was a member until his departure in 2004. Westlife sold over 50 million records worldwide, a total that included studio albums, singles, video releases, and compilation albums. The group accumulated 14 number-one singles in the United Kingdom. The group released their eleventh UK No. 1 single, \\"Unbreakable\\" in 2002. Amidst rumours of a split, Westlife released their first greatest hits album in November that same year titled Unbreakable - The Greatest Hits Vol. 1, which zoomed all the way to No. 1 in the UK. The release was followed by the double A-side single \\"Tonight/Miss You Nights\\", which debuted at No. 3 in the UK. At this time, Because Films Inspire made a TV documentary titled \\"Wild Westlife\\", directed by Iain MacDonald and starred the group, featuring their daily life as musicians and their tour experiences. In 2003, Westlife went on their third world tour, The Greatest Hits Tour, shrugging off rumours of a split. In September 2003, Westlife released \\"Hey Whatever\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the UK Charts. Their fourth studio album, Turnaround, was then released in November, earning the group another UK No. 1 album. \\"Mandy\\", a cover of the Barry Manilow hit, was released in November 2003. Their version won them their third Record of the Year award, in under five years. Their version of \\"Mandy\\" is also considered the single with the longest leap to the top (from No. 200 to No. 1) in UK music history. \\"Obvious\\" was released as the final single from the album, charting at #3. On 9 March 2004, just three weeks prior to embarking on their fourth world tour, McFadden left the group to spend more time with his family and work on solo projects. On that day, a press conference was held where all the group's members were present, each giving emotional individual speeches. McFadden's final public performance as part of Westlife was at Newcastle upon Tyne's Powerhouse nightclub on 27 February 2004. He subsequently began a solo career, and reverted the spelling of his first name back to its original 'Brian'. He released his first solo single, \\"Real To Me\\", which entered the UK chart at No. 1 and soon after, he released his first solo album Irish Son under Sony Music. McFadden later released more singles, but only with moderate success. Less than a month after McFadden's departure, the group kicked off their \\"Turnaround Tour\\".

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] I am facing a new situation today: The underwater fishing teams picked their spots early. Team Bob went at the mouth of the river, where the freshwater met the salty seawater in the hope that more turbidity from the river and more nutrients will attract more fish.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The San Diego Museum of Art is a fine arts museum located at 1450 El Prado in Balboa Park in San Diego, California that houses a broad collection with particular strength in Spanish art. The San Diego Museum of Art opened as The Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego on February 28, 1926, and changed its name to the San Diego Museum of Art in 1978. The official Balboa Park website calls the San Diego Museum of Art \\"the region's oldest and largest art museum\\". Nearly half a million people visit the museum each year. - The Young Shepherdess is an 1885 painting by William - Adolphe Bouguereau ( 1825 -- 1905 ) . It is owned by the San Diego Museum of Art. This and similar images by the artist attracted collectors in Europe and America because of their nostalgic content . In such works the artist depicted a variety of poses and expressions , in this case showing the mild curiosity of the girl . In portraying a shepherdess Bouguereau is working within the pastoral mode or theme , as developed by ancient Greek and Hellenistic artists and poets . French painters who preceded him in this include Claude Lorrain , Poussin , and Watteau . - William-Adolphe Bouguereau (November 30, 1825 August 19, 1905) was a French academic painter and traditionalist. In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes. In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work. Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are still unknown. - San Diego (Spanish for \\"Saint Didacus\\") is a major city in California, United States.

Gaius Julius Caesar (; 12 or 13 July 100 BC - 15 March 44 BC), known by his cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. In 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59 BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid - even Cato, with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favour of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative Marcus Bibulus. Caesar was already in Crassus' political debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (\\"rule of three men\\"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, who was the daughter of another powerful senator. Caesar proposed a law for redistributing public lands to the poor--by force of arms, if need be--a proposal supported by Pompey and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but he was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His bodyguards had their ceremonial axes broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts proved ineffective in obstructing Caesar's legislation. Roman satirists ever after referred to the year as \\"the consulship of Julius and Caesar.\\" When Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the governorship of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over. With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) and Illyricum (southeastern Europe), with Transalpine Gaul (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one. When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province. Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of Gaul were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the Battle of Magetobriga, with the help of a contingent of Germanic tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes. In response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite Britain. During the spring of 56 BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The Lucca Conference renewed the First Triumvirate and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years. The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained. Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain. In 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the Veneti of Brittany. His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter. He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time. While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed invasion of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead. Though the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. Vercingetorix's attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late. He proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender. Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year, Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed that during the Gallic Wars the army had fought against three million men (of whom one million died, and another million were enslaved), subjugated 300 tribes, and destroyed 800 cities. While he was still campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honour Caesar's victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans. On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus would be the next heir in succession. In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome. During his early career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and dysfunctional the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery had broken down under the weight of imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. With a weak central government, political corruption had spiralled out of control, and the status quo had been maintained by a corrupt aristocracy, which saw no need to change a system that had made its members rich. Between his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the Republic. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together all of the provinces into a single cohesive unit. The first goal was accomplished when Caesar defeated Pompey and his supporters. To accomplish the other two goals, he needed to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed, so he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Finally, he enacted a series of reforms that were meant to address several long-neglected issues, the most important of which was his reform of the calendar.

Taiwan was first populated by Austronesian people and was colonized by the Dutch, who had arrived in 1623. The Kingdom of Tungning, lasting from 1661 to 1683, was the first Han Chinese government to rule Taiwan. From 1683, the Qing Dynasty ruled Taiwan as a prefecture and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures. In 1885 the island was made into a separate Chinese province to speed up development in this region. In the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan and Penghu were ceded by the Qing Dynasty to Japan in 1895. Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to the Republic of China at end of World War II, putting Taiwan under a Chinese government again after 50 years of Japanese rule. The ROC would then claim sovereignty on the basis of the Qing dynasty's administration, Cairo Declaration, Potsdam Declaration, and Japanese Instrument of Surrender, but this became contested by pro-independence groups in subsequent years due to different perceptions of the said documents' legality. Upon losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, the ROC government retreated to Taipei, and kept control over a few islands along the coast of mainland China and in the South China Sea.

Here is a question about this article: For most of its independent years, the country has been engrossed in rampant ethnic strife and Burma's myriad ethnic groups have been involved in one of the world's longest-running ongoing civil wars. During this time, the United Nations and several other organisations have reported consistent and systematic human rights violations in the country. In 2011, the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election, and a nominally civilian government was installed. While former military leaders still wield enormous power in the country, Burmese Military have taken steps toward relinquishing control of the government. This, along with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and political prisoners, has improved the country's human rights record and foreign relations, and has led to the easing of trade and other economic sanctions. There is, however, continuing criticism of the government's treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority and its poor response to the religious clashes.

Article: I discovered the power of fear when I became stuck to my driveway, as if my feet were crazy--glued to the cement .As much as I tried, I could not move them. The realization that my daughters were playing in Nancy's house, just one-half block away, paralyzed my legs, making me unable to move when I neared the end of our driveway. Dense, black smoke was rising from behind the Sycamore Maple trees on the other side of the street and was enveloping three houses, making them barely visible. Nancy's house was one of them. I tried to call out for my daughters hoping to see them run safely to my arms, but my voice was also stuck - stuck in my throat with no intention of coming out. There I stood, helpless, paralyzed and silenced by fear, unable to protect the two little girls I loved more than even I had realized. Although trapped in a body that couldn't move or speak, I could still hear. I could hear other mothers anxiously calling their children. I could hear a frightening silence that covered the neighborhood instead of the usual happy voices of children. And, finally, I could hear the alarm of the fire engine. As the alarm announced, \\"We're on our way,\\" it instantly dissolved the crazy glue that had held my feet to the cement and it unlocked the soundproof box that had silenced my voice. I was free to make sure my daughters were safe. As I continued down the driveway, two little girls, my two little girls, ran toward me from across the street. They had come home to tell me about the fire in the garage next to Nancy's house. Not only did my feet and voice work now, but my eyes were also in good working order and had no trouble producing tears. Question: What is the best title for the text? Answer: Pick from: I.

Here is a news article: Discovery turns out to be shipwreck Published: January 23, 2015 7:56AM JEFF TER HAR — For The Daily Astorian Part of a ship’s keel was discovered last November by Seaside residents Ben Hidy and Travis Trapani. JEFF TER HAR — For The Daily Astorian The best environment to preserve a ship recently discovered buried in sand on the Seaside beach is under the sand, says the state’s archaeologist. JEFF TER HAR — For The Daily Astorian The wood found two months ago by two Seaside residents comes from a ship, according to the state archaeologist. More tests may lead to the ship’s identity. The state archeologist says the wood found last November under the sand in Seaside was, indeed, a ship. SEASIDE — What three friends discovered while metal-detecting in the dunes last November is indeed a shipwreck. Now the question is: which one? “We have over 2,000 wrecks at the mouth of the Columbia (River),” said Oregon’s State Archaeologist, Dennis Griffin. “So it’s interesting if we can figure out what wreck this is because we don’t have it on record.” In hopes of recovering the ship’s identity, Griffin traveled to the site near Avenue L Jan. 13 and took two wood samples from the boat’s 21-foot keel, then sent them to Eugene for testing. The results, expected in a few weeks, will determine the type of lumber used in construction and, in turn, narrow the ship’s potential points of origin. Hypothetically “Let’s say it’s Douglas fir,” Griffin said. “If that’s what it is, that’s usually used in more West Coast shipping.” Should that be the case, lost ships from abroad — and even the East Coast — would be crossed off the list of candidates. The tests being performed will not account for age, though Christopher Dewey, a volunteer at the Columbia River Maritime Museum, examined the site and estimated that the ship was built in the 20th century. “It’s really a process of elimination,” Griffin said. “You look at reported wrecks in the area and try to determine would this size of an artifact be from one ship rather than another? Trying to nail that down to one particular wreck, that can be very difficult.” That is, in part, because where a ship was known to sink and where it may wash up can be vastly different. “We’ve known boats to hit a sandbar off the Columbia but found the wrecks had floated down 20-some miles or so to Arch Cape,” Griffin said. Historically, lost ships are more likely not to be found, he said. “Over 3,000 wrecks are known to be off the coast of Oregon,” he said. “We have the locations of a little over 300 in our database.” Regardless of whether or not the wreck beneath the dunes in Seaside is identified, it’s likely to remain where it is — buried in the sand. “Once a piece of a ship that’s been in a water-logged state leaves the beach, or leaves that environment, it will dry and fall apart,” Griffin said. “It would need to be placed in a tank ­— in a plastic solution — that protects it. I don’t know of any place on the West Coast that has a tank large enough to hold that piece. This piece of wood is huge. It would cost tens-upon-tens-of-thousands of dollars to protect that wood.” “The best environment it could be in is right where it is now,” he said. “It’s being preserved right there.” The worth of the find, he added, is purely informational. “We place the value, archaeologywise, on the historical value,” he said. “What those sites have is a potential to tell us more about our past.” “Shipwrecks tie us more into the land that we now live in,” he added. “Whether it’s the logging industry, whether it’s commercial trade or fishing trade, whatever it was, it’s all important.” “The wreck itself might be important because, perhaps, it was a fishing trawler that sunk in a storm in the 1930s,” Griffin said. “If so, it tells us more about the expanse of people going out there to harvest fish to feed the growing cities.” “So it’s about historical value,” he said. “We don’t place monetary value on these sites.” ||||| SEASIDE, Ore.

Write a summary based on this article: One of the most significant financial problems that countries will face in the coming decades is the amount they will spend to support the elderly. This will be exacerbated by increased debt-to-GDP ratios in most of the 49 countries where old age costs will be the highest percentage of GDP, according to the Standard & Poor’s Global Aging Report. Of the 49 countries, 32 are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and 17 are large, emerging market nations. The Standard & Poor’s Global Aging report emphasizes: “No other force is likely to shape the future of national economic health, public finances, and policy making as the irreversible rate at which the world’s population is aging. The problem has been long observed and is well understood.” The analysis adds, “U.N. figures show the proportion of the world’s population aged over 65 is set to more than double by 2050, to 16.2% from 7.6% currently.” “The elderly” refers to people who are over 65. These people are, for the most part, retired and not working. The eventual burden of supporting them will become impossible to sustain in some countries, and in many it nearly is already. These huge debt loads of many countries have risen as nations have spent far more than their tax receipts, and the trouble can no longer be remedied by GDP growth as it often was in the latter half of the 20th Century. Few developed nations have rapid enough GDP growth to decrease deficits and bring down national debt. That leaves higher taxes and spending cuts as the only means to close budget gaps. Care for the elderly the US is at the core of entitlement reform. Projections by the Congressional Budget Office and think tanks show that Social Security and Medicare costs will be overwhelming in a few decades. Defense cuts and reductions in discretionary federal government spending will not be enough to offset the cost of entitlement programs, which are growing more quickly than other government expenses. According to Standard and Poor’s, the United States will undergo a greater increase in health care spending for the elderly than any other developed nation. The battle over entitlement reforms has begun already. People who are in their prime working years face the possibility that the payments they receive from Social Security will be less than those their parents received or are receiving. The analysis of the problem takes into account: (1) the amount spent as a percentage of GDP on health care for elderly, (2) pension spending, (3) unemployment benefits for the elderly, and (4) long-term care. Health care and long-term care are primarily medical costs. Pension costs, which include early retirement and disability pensions, cover primarily the expenses of daily living. Unemployment costs cover the elderly who do not have pensions or other means of independent financial support. Each country’s burden is based on current GDP growth and for the next four decades, net government debt, debt as a percentage of GDP, and the S&P sovereign credit rating of the 49 countries. 24/7 Wall St. chose the ten nations which currently spend the most on care for the elderly as a percentage of GDP. Most of these counties face a grim financial future as the number of old people grows more quickly than their country’s GDP. This gap will be a primary driver of increases in national deficits, which in turn will drive national debt higher. There have been no acceptable solutions suggested for these problems. All of citizens of nations on this list refuse to have their retirement benefits lowered. The issues can be deferred, but the process that will increase costs will eventually push indebted nations to the point where sovereign borrowing will become unsustainable. Then, like Greece, many of the nations analyzed here will face years of austerity forced on them by creditors. ||||| One of the most significant financial problems that countries will face in the coming decades is the amount they will spend to support the elderly.

Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me.

Think of the savings in terms of fuel bills and unfriendly emissions. Such houses in fact exist, called \\"passive houses\\". The concept of these highly energy-efficient buildings took root in the 1990s, before slowly consolidating as a niche construction concept in the 2000s. Are passive houses now actively moving into the mainstream as sustainable buildings? For Brian McGarry, an economics lecturer who built a family house based on passive housing criteria in the Pyrenees this year, the arguments look convincing. As his first full winter in the low energy house draws in, we asked him to keep us informed. Do passive houses work? I had never heard of a passive house in February 2012, when I purchased a plot of land. Nor did I expect that I would be persuaded to build a pre-constructed, custom-designed house based on energy-efficient passive house criteria. It promised to be easier and quicker to build, cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. The objective was to incorporate the fundamental concepts of passive energy management into my project: an airtight and highly insulated building envelope; large southfacing double or triple-glazed windows (if possible, filled with argon gas) that passively capture the energy of the sun; a heat recovery ventilation system to provide fresh air; and a simple, low-cost heating system consisting of a modern wood-burning stove, a bathroom heater and a portable radiator backup for when the sun doesn't shine and temperatures decline. No significant limitations were placed on the design, and it had excellent environmental credentials. Moreover, the cost was no more than a conventional build. After six months in use, the house is proving to be both cheap to run and remarkably comfortable-staying cool in the hot summer was effortless, as long as the windows were shuttered or shaded from the sun. Nowstaying warm in the cold, high-altitude December climate also seems easy, so far. Winter arrived in force in the... Question: How did Brian McGarry find his self-built passive house?

Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. I am facing a new situation today: two buildings had different tenants. Building Y had many seniors over 65 years of age, and building X had individuals under 65 years old. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which building had fewer people that have retired from work? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the background article. From the article, we can gather that most people over 65 have retired from work. Step 2: Apply the information to the new situation. In the new situation, we have two buildings: Building Y with many seniors over 65 years of age, and Building X with individuals under 65 years old. Step 3: Compare the retirement rates in both buildings. Since most people over 65 have retired, there is a higher likelihood that a larger proportion of tenants in Building Y, with seniors over 65 years old, have retired. On the other hand, Building X has individuals under 65 years old, which means the likelihood of them being retired is lower. Step 4: Determine the answer to the question.

Answer:","completion":"The product review provided conveys a positive sentiment, albeit with a focus on the book's ability to evoke strong feelings of fear in the reader. It appears that the person reviewing the book has a strong interest and experience in reading books within the horror genre, as they mention having \\"read them all.\\" In this context, their statement that this particular book is the \\"scariest book\\" they have ever read can be perceived as high praise for the book, showcasing its effectiveness in causing an intense and frightful experience for the reader. This effectively indicates that the book is successful in achieving its goal of provoking fear within its audience. Additionally, the reviewer emphasizes the book's lingering impact after reading, mentioning that it \\"will keep you awake after you put it down for the night.\\" This further reinforces the positive sentiment in the review, as it highlights the book's powerful capacity to stay with the reader even after they've stopped reading. Such a statement would be particularly appealing to fans of the horror genre, as this lasting-effect is often a sought-after characteristic within the realm of scary books. However, it's worth noting that the reviewer's statement at the beginning - \\"This book is hard to read if you're in the house alone\\" - could be perceived as a mild drawback for some potential readers. People who might be easily frightened or uncomfortable with horror might take this statement as a warning for the strong intensity of fear the book provokes. However, for seasoned horror fans, this statement could actually heighten the appeal of the book, indicating that it provides a genuinely terrifying experience. In conclusion, the provided review conveys a positive sentiment highlighting the book's effectiveness in inducing fear and its ability to leave a lasting impact on the reader. While the reviewer acknowledges the intensity of the book's fear-inducing capabilities, which could potentially be seen as a warning for readers who are not fans of horror, the review overall praises the book's success in achieving its primary goal as a scary story and is likely to entice horror enthusiasts seeking an intense and provocative reading experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I am so glad that I did not pay for this book! Though it contains the bulk of historical fact from the time period, that is the only positive thing I can say. The fiction part of the book is unbelievably juvenile, with characters making unlikely speeches and/or abruptly changing attitudes or personalities with no explanation. It seriously undermines the work and makes it intolerable to read through. I made it to the \\"Eleanor sleeping with the King\\" scene before I had to stop reading from pure disgust at the awfulness of the writing and lack of imagination/storytelling skills of the author.

I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie. A gorgeous color palette (man, this looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with \\"Scat,\\" is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. \\"Sid\\" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie. Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger This isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters. This isn't interrupted with a lot of songs, either: one only brief one and there is nothing offensive, language-wise. If more animated movies were this good, I'd own more. Choose your answer.

III] Respiratory system: This is the correct answer. The main function of the respiratory system is to bring in oxygen from the environment into the body and to expel carbon dioxide from the body into the environment. This exchange of gases primarily takes place in the lungs, which are part of the respiratory system.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the data extracted from the sentence: 1. Location: Amdavad ni Gufa. - Amdavad ni Gufa is a place that can be found in India. It is an underground art gallery and cave-like structure located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Designed by the renowned architect Balkrishna Vithaldas Doshi, it features prominent artist M.F. Husain's artwork. This detail is a piece of cultural information about India and provides insight into its unique art and architectural spaces. 2. Country: India. - The sentence explicitly mentions that Amdavad ni Gufa is situated in India. India is a South Asian country, the seventh-largest by land area, and the second most populous nation globally. Known for its diverse culture, languages, and traditions, India is an essential country to know and understand in a global context. 3. Leader: T S Thakur. - The sentence states that T S Thakur is a prominent leader in India. However, this information is outdated as T.S. Thakur served as the 43rd Chief Justice of India from December 3, 2015, to January 3, 2017. In this capacity, he was the highest-ranking judicial officer in the country, overseeing the Indian judiciary as it functions at various levels. Even though T.S. Thakur is no longer the Chief Justice, this information still provides essential historical context within the political scenario in India. 4. Prime Minister: Narendra Modi. - The sentence identifies Narendra Modi as the current Prime Minister of India. Indeed, Narendra Modi has been serving as the Prime Minister since May 26, 2014, and is also a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). As the Prime Minister, he is responsible for shaping and implementing the policies and programs of the Indian Government and overseeing the executive branch. This fact is essential as it provides information about the current political leadership in India. In summary, the sentence provides valuable information related to the country of India, focusing on a cultural site (Amdavad ni Gufa), its location within India, and important historical and current political figures (T S Thakur and Narendra Modi)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A-Teens (stylized as A*Teens) were a Swedish pop music group from Stockholm, Sweden, formed by Niklas Berg in 1998 as an ABBA tribute band called ABBA Teens and later renamed A-Teens. The band members were Marie Serneholt, Amit Sebastian Paul, Dhani Lennevald and Sara Lumholdt. The band's debut album became a success around the world and in 2001 it was reported that the band had sold 6 million albums worldwide. After six years together, the band announced they would take a break in 2004 after the release of their Greatest Hits album. The band's second album, entitled \\"Teen Spirit\\", featured a compilation of tracks that were not ABBA covers and when it was finally released on 26 February 2001, it debuted at number two in the Swedish Charts. This pop sensation hit reached the top ten in other countries and entered at number eighty-three on the World Charts, number thirteen on the European Albums Chart, number fourteen on CNN's WorldBeat Album Charts and peaked at number fifty in the United States selling over 60,000 copies in its first two weeks, ensuring Gold Status for sales exceeding the 500,000 copies in the United States alone. Prior to the release of the album, the A-Teens became one of the first bands to broadcast one of their shows on MSN's Websites. The UK releases were delayed due to A-Teens' failure with their previous album in that country. When \\"Upside Down\\" was released there in May 2001, it became their biggest hit in the country. The single peaked at number ten in the United Kingdom becoming their only top ten hit in that country. The album was delayed and released after the second single, \\"Halfway Around The World\\" in late October 2001. The single barely made the top thirty and the album did not chart in the top 75. Before they started their concert tour in the U.S. the band went to promote their album to Asia, with stops in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia where they did show for MTV Asia and Thailand, with great success, especially in the former where Coca-Cola signed the band to become the face of the brand there and promote, \\"We were the first international artists ever to appear on a soda can there. They printed 15 million of them; we went home with ten!\\" Remembers Sara, The cans were distributed around the country that year. Also in 2001, the A-Teens performed as top billing during the Radio Disney Live! 2001 World Tour in Chicago and Philadelphia markets. The group promoted their album with a forty-three-date tour with Aaron Carter around the U.S. Back in Europe, the band toured with No Angels in Germany. By the end of 2001, Teen Spirit went on to sell over 1 million copies worldwide and were invited by Walt Disney/Buena Vista to record the European soundtrack for the movie \\"The Princess Diaries\\".

Would \\"A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"It is important to address this sensitive topic cautiously. I understand that your question is about the age of a child in relation to pedophilic crimes, and whether the provided statement about research done since the 1980s is a reasonable answer. Firstly, let me clarify that pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder and not a crime in itself. It is when an adult experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children, typically aged under 13. However, acting upon these urges and engaging in sexual activities with children is a criminal offense, commonly known as child sexual abuse. Now, regarding your question about the age of a child in pedophilic crimes, the age can vary depending on the jurisdiction. Different countries have different age limits defining minors, usually ranging from under 16 to under 18 years of age. However, pedophilic attraction usually targets prepubescent children, typically younger than 13 years old. Regarding the statement \\"A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s,\\" it is reasonable to say that efforts to understand and address this issue have increased since the 1980s. However, this statement does not directly answer the question about the age of a child in relation to pedophile crimes. Instead, it provides information about the timeline of research into the issue without addressing the specific details about the age of the children involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1782, Marshall won a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates, in which he served until 1789 and again from 1795 to 1796. The Virginia General Assembly elected him to serve on the Council of State later in the same year. In 1785, Marshall took up the additional office of Recorder of the Richmond City Hustings Court. In 1788, Marshall was selected as a delegate to the Virginia convention responsible for ratifying or rejecting the United States Constitution, which had been proposed by the Philadelphia Convention a year earlier. Together with James Madison and Edmund Randolph, Marshall led the fight for ratification. He was especially active in defense of Article III, which provides for the Federal judiciary. His most prominent opponent at the ratification convention was Anti-Federalist leader Patrick Henry. Ultimately, the convention approved the Constitution by a vote of 89-79. Marshall identified with the new Federalist Party (which supported a strong national government and commercial interests), and opposed Jefferson's Republican Party (which advocated states' rights and idealized the yeoman farmer and the French Revolution). Meanwhile, Marshall's private law practice continued to flourish. He successfully represented the heirs of Lord Fairfax in Hite v. Fairfax (1786), an important Virginia Supreme Court case involving a large tract of land in the Northern Neck of Virginia. In 1796, he appeared before the United States Supreme Court in another important case, Ware v. Hylton, a case involving the validity of a Virginia law providing for the confiscation of debts owed to British subjects. Marshall argued that the law was a legitimate exercise of the state's power; however, the Supreme Court ruled against him, holding that the Treaty of Paris in combination with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution required the collection of such debts. Henry Flanders in his biography of Marshall remarked that Marshall's argument in Ware v. Hylton \\"elicited great admiration at the time of its delivery, and enlarged the circle of his reputation.\\" Flanders also wrote that the reader \\"cannot fail to be impressed with the vigor, rigorous analysis, and close reasoning that mark every sentence of it.\\" In 1795, Marshall declined Washington's offer of Attorney General of the United States and, in 1796, declined to serve as minister to France. In 1797, Marshall accepted when President John Adams appointed him to a three-member commission to represent the United States to negotiate with France which, during the midst of its Revolutionary Wars, had seized neutral American merchant vessels. This had prompted the United States to appropriate funds to equip and man three frigates. The other members of this commission were Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. However, when the envoys arrived in October 1797, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After this, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents. Each refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained. This diplomatic scandal became known as the XYZ Affair, inflaming anti-French opinion in the United States. Marshall arrived in New York on June 17. His handling of the affair, as well as public resentment toward the French, made him popular with the American public. He opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, enacted by the Federalists in response to the crisis. In 1798, Marshall declined a Supreme Court appointment, recommending Bushrod Washington, who would later become one of Marshall's staunchest allies on the Court. In 1799, Marshall reluctantly ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. Although his congressional district (which included the city of Richmond) favored the Democratic-Republican Party, Marshall won the race, in part due to his conduct during the XYZ Affair and in part due to the support of Patrick Henry. His most notable speech was related to the case of Thomas Nash (alias Jonathan Robbins), whom the government had extradited to Great Britain on charges of murder. Marshall defended the government's actions, arguing that nothing in the Constitution prevents the United States from extraditing one of its citizens. On May 7, 1800, President Adams nominated Congressman Marshall as Secretary of War. However, on May 12, Adams withdrew the nomination, instead naming him Secretary of State, as a replacement for Timothy Pickering. Confirmed by the United States Senate on May 13, Marshall took office on June 6, 1800. As Secretary of State, Marshall directed the negotiation of the Convention of 1800, which ended the Quasi-War with France and brought peace to the nation. Elected as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830, John Marshall advanced his view that the electorate should be expanded in Virginia by the provision that any white male who had served in the War of 1812 or who would serve in the militia in the future defense of the country deserved the right to vote. Fletcher v. Peck (1810) was the first case in which the Supreme Court ruled a state law unconstitutional, though the Court had long before voided a state law as conflicting with the combination of the Constitution together with a treaty (Marshall had represented the losing side in that 1796 case). In Fletcher, the Georgia legislature had approved a land grant, known as the Yazoo Land Act of 1795. It was then revealed that the land grant had been approved in return for bribes, and therefore voters rejected most of the incumbents; the next legislature repealed the law and voided all subsequent transactions (even honest ones) that resulted from the Yazoo land scandal. The Marshall Court held that the state legislature's repeal of the law was void because the sale was a binding contract, which according to Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the Contract Clause) of the Constitution, cannot be invalidated. Marshall emphasized that the rescinding act would seize property from individuals who had honestly acquired it, and transfer that property to the public without any compensation. He then expanded upon his own famous statement in Marbury about the province of the judiciary: It is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society; the application of those rules to individuals in society would seem to be the duty of other departments. Based on this separation of powers principle, Marshall questioned whether the rescinding act would be valid even if Georgia were a completely sovereign state independent of the federal Constitution. Ultimately, though, Marshall grounded the Court's opinion in the restrictions imposed by the federal Constitution. As in Marbury, this decision of the Court in Fletcher was unanimous. Answer this question \\"What was Marshall's involvement in this case?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Marshall's involvement in the case of Fletcher v. Peck (1810) was as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, in which he delivered the Court's opinion.

Write a text based on this summary: clinton cracks down on teen smoking Text:","completion":"Title: Clinton Takes a Stand Against Teen Smoking – A Protective Measure for Future Generations In an effort to combat the escalating number of teenagers who are taking up the habit of smoking, former President Bill Clinton has taken a decisive step to crack down on this dangerous trend. Recognizing the tremendous health risks and long-term consequences associated with smoking, Clinton's campaign is aimed at protecting the vulnerable teenage population, fostering a healthier future for generations to come. Faced with the alarming statistic that around 90% of smokers start before the age of 18, it has become increasingly clear that smoking is not just an adult problem. The teenage years are a critical period during which lifelong habits begin to form, and for many, this includes the development of a smoking addiction that will persist for years or even decades. The Clinton initiative begins by targeting the accessibility of cigarettes to young people. By pushing for stricter enforcement of the legal smoking age and demanding more rigorous identification checks at points of sale, the initiative aims to make it significantly more difficult for teenagers to obtain cigarettes. Retailers found in violation of these laws will face substantial fines and the potential loss of their tobacco sales license. Another important aspect of the initiative is educational outreach with a particular focus on preventive measures. Campaigns will target middle and high schools, where the habit often first takes root. With a combination of engaging presentations, age-appropriate materials, and testimonies from former smokers, young people will be equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to resist the allure of smoking and make healthier choices. Educational programs will also focus on dispelling common myths about smoking, such as the idea that it aids in weight loss or relieves stress, thus eliminating common motivations for starting. Supporting this educational campaign, the Clinton initiative calls for stringent restrictions on cigarette advertising, especially in avenues that can easily reach young, impressionable minds. It has long been known that tobacco companies have purposely targeted youth with their advertising strategies, tapping into teenage rebellion, the desire to fit in, or the attractiveness of an \\"adult\\" vice. By limiting the visibility and reach of these advertisements, it becomes more difficult for tobacco companies to normalize or glamorize smoking among teenagers. Additionally, the crackdown will include a concerted effort to ensure the proper labeling of tobacco products, emphasizing the inclusion of clear, graphic warnings about the associated risks and potential health consequences. While many tobacco products currently include warning labels, they are often relegated to the small print or obscured by clever packaging. By making these warnings more prominent and visually arresting, the initiative will make it more difficult for teenagers to ignore or minimize the hazards of smoking. Finally, the Clinton campaign aims to work in tandem with existing public health and medical organizations to identify and support teenagers who are already struggling with nicotine addiction. By offering targeted intervention and counseling services, as well as medical assistance and resources, these efforts can help reverse the cycle of addiction and guide teens towards healthier choices and behaviors. With the Clinton crackdown on teen smoking, the fight against this deadly habit is receiving much-needed support and momentum. By implementing a multifaceted approach that includes education, regulation, and community support, the Clinton initiative endeavors to save lives, improve health outcomes, and ultimately, prevent future generations from succumbing to the devastating consequences of smoking."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Person B: Oh, you're talking about that huge tome on history she was reading, right? Well, she didn't read it cover to cover. Instead, she read it selectively. Person A: That's interesting! Selectively, you say? How did she decide what parts to read and what parts to skip? Person B: Well, you see, she initially skimmed through the table of contents to identify the chapters and sections that were most relevant to her research or piqued her interest. When she found something that caught her attention, she would then devote her time to reading it. Person A: That seems like a smart way to tackle such a massive book. But what about the parts she skipped? Wasn't she concerned that she might miss some important information? Person B: That's a valid concern, but she took some measures to mitigate that risk. Whenever she skipped a section, she'd quickly read through any summaries or conclusions that the author had written. She would also occasionally do some background research on the topic just to make sure she wasn't missing any essential details. Person A: That sounds like a pretty thorough approach. But didn't all that skimming and jumping around make it difficult for her to understand the material? Person B: It could have been a problem, but she already had a solid foundation in the subject, so she was able to contextualize the information she was reading. Moreover, she made sure to take detailed notes as she progressed through the book and would periodically review them to ensure that she was connecting the dots and grasping the bigger picture. Person A: I see! So reading it selectively didn't hinder her from getting a good understanding of the book overall. I might try that the next time I'm faced with a massive book to read. Person B: Absolutely, it can be a very effective method when you're trying to efficiently absorb a vast amount of information. Just remember to combine it with good note-taking, some background research, and a thorough understanding of the subject, and you'll be good to go! Person A: Thanks for all the insight! I'll make sure to put these techniques into practice. By the way, did she manage to find what she was looking for in that book? Person B: Yes, she did! Reading selectively allowed her to extract valuable information and insights that helped her build a strong foundation for her research. It was definitely a successful endeavor for her.

Article: Jeremy Kerr, a researcher at the University of Ottawa in Canada, and his colleagues analyzed more than 400,000 observations of bumblebee species collected in North America and Europe from 1975 to 2010. When the researchers recorded the locations of these bee populations, they found that many of the 67 species analyzed were moving northward from their southern limits while the northern edges of the bees' ranges are staying in place. What it results in is obvious. Bees have been paid more attention to in recent years, with populations of honeybees and bumblebees obviously declining in some parts of Europe. Previously, attention on the decline of bee populations has focused on causes including habitat loss, pesticide use and the spread of bee parasites . But the work by Kerr's team found something different. \\"For every species, there is one or two species declining and others that are not moving at all,\\" says Kerr. This shift has also been observed in other species, such as butterflies. But due to a new cause -- the rise of temperatures instead of total pesticide use, a change in land use or parasites, bumblebees -- unlike butterflies -- have failed to extend the northern boundaries of their ranges into the territory that is now habitable for them, so bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining rapidly, the latest study led by Kerr's team finds. \\"Our data suggest that the new factor plays a leading, or perhaps the leading, role in this trend,\\" says Kerr. \\"This study shows that a fourth factor is also beginning to affect it. It is likely that the combined stresses from all of these pressures will have destructive impacts on bumblebees in the not-too-distant future,\\" says Dave Goulson, a bee researcher at the University of Sussex, Brighton, UK. Exactly what can be done to help bumblebees is not clear. Kerr's team suggests that relocating colonies might be an answer but Goulson says that because the insects are mobile they are capable of moving northwards if there is suitable habitat available. Question: Which statement may Goulson agree with? Options: A: Relocating bumblebees isn't much good. B: The findings of Kerr's study are doubtful. C: The future of bumblebees is still promising.

Write some highlights for the following article: A doctor who abducted her six-year-old daughter and vanished in the wake of a marriage break-up has been told by a judge 'the courts will not give up'. Deputy High Court Judge Clive Heaton issued a warning nearly two years after Humma Dar, 39, disappeared with daughter Aamina Khan, who will be eight in July. The judge said it was impossible not to have sympathy for Aamina’s father Safraz Khan, 44, from Croydon, south London, who is also a doctor and had been given custody of the girl. Abduction: Judge Clive Heaton issued a warning nearly two years after Dar disappeared with her daughter Aamina. He said the search for Aamina and Dar - who vanished from Morden, south-west London, in August 2011 and are thought to be in Pakistan - had not reached its end. He was speaking at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, where he gave permission for Aamina to be identified in media reports. 'The abduction of children is a very serious matter and the courts should and do pursue, locate and return such children to their rightful carers,' said the judge. Father and daughter: The judge added that it was impossible not to feel sympathy for Aamina's father Safraz Khan, who had been given custody of the child. 'The message must go out to those who. abduct children that the courts will not give up after a few months or. years just because no progress seems to have been made.' He added: 'This is not the end of the story so far as attempts to locate Aamina are concerned.' Mother: Humma Dar is thought to have taken her daughter Aamina to Pakistan after she abducted her. The judge said Dr Khan - who broke down during the hearing - was 'distressed and frustrated'. 'It is impossible not to have sympathy with the father,' he said. “I urge the father to continue to pursue all proper steps open to him to locate his daughter. Where the court can properly assist him in the search it will certainly do so.” The judge said Aamina had been visiting her mother when the pair vanished on August 26 2011. He said Dr Dar had 'abducted' Aamina and evidence suggested that they had gone to Pakistan. Dr Khan had begun civil court action in the hope of finding his daughter and police in London and Pakistan had been involved in trying to trace Dr Dar - who had been hoping to be a GP - and Aamina, the court heard. 'It is an extraordinarily serious matter,' said the judge. 'This child has been missing ... for approaching two years.' He added: 'Sadly the whereabouts of both the mother and child remain unknown.' Highlights:","completion":"1. Deputy High Court Judge Clive Heaton issued a warning two years after Dr. Humma Dar disappeared with her daughter, Aamina Khan. 2.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate changes happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The climate change, in general, does not have a direct effect on the process of the dishwasher cleaning the dishes better. Dishwashers are closed systems, so they do not rely on external environmental factors during the cleaning process, such as temperature or humidity. However, there might be some indirect effects of climate change on the dishwasher's performance. For example, climate change could lead to a higher demand for energy-efficient appliances. As a result, new dishwasher models might be developed with more energy-efficient features that can also enhance the dishwashing performance, such as improved water heating or better spray jet technology. Another indirect effect could be an increased focus on water conservation in response to climate change. This may lead to dishwashers being designed to use less water while still maintaining their cleaning efficiency. In this case, the perturbation may help improve the dishwasher's cleaning capabilities by forcing technological advancements. In conclusion, while climate change itself does not directly affect the dishwasher's performance, it might indirectly influence the advancement and design of dishwashers leading to improvement in cleaning performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Russia Withdraws From Plutonium Disposal Treaty\\"","completion":"Title: Russia Withdraws From Plutonium Disposal Treaty Introduction In a surprising move, Russia has announced its withdrawal from the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA), a key non-proliferation treaty aimed at mutual commitments of both Russia and the US to dispose of their excess weapons-grade plutonium. This unilateral decision raises questions and concerns over the future of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and the escalating tensions between Russia and the United States. Background of the Plutonium Disposal Treaty The PMDA, signed in 2000 by Russia and the United States, was designed to enhance nuclear security and mitigate risks associated with uncontrolled excess weapons-grade plutonium stockpiles. Under the terms of the treaty, each nation agreed to irreversibly dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus plutonium, enough to create thousands of nuclear weapons. In 2010, the treaty was amended with the Protocol, which outlined specific translational measures for plutonium disposal. The agreement required each nation to implement the disposal process by incorporating the excess plutonium into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, thus making it suitable for use in civilian nuclear power plants and rendering it unsuitable for weapons production. Reasons for Russia's Withdrawal Officially, Russia cited \\"unfriendly actions\\" by the United States as the primary factor influencing its decision. They argued that the US had failed to meet the terms of the agreement. Specifically, the US was accused of pursuing a substandard method of diluting and storing plutonium, rather than actual disposal through MOX fuel fabrication, contrary to the treaty terms. Experts, however, believe that the reasons for Russia's withdrawal are more complex and may include economic, political, and strategic factors. The strained relations between Russia and the United States, triggered by issues such as the Russian annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, could be significant contributing factors. Consequences and Implications of Withdrawal Russia's withdrawal from the Plutonium Disposal Treaty could have multiple implications for nuclear security, diplomacy, and international non-proliferation efforts. Firstly, it casts doubt on Russia's commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament goals, potentially undermining the broader international regime. Secondly, the decision might cause increasing uncertainty in the already-fragile relationship between Russia and the United States, leading to increased mistrust and escalating tensions. This move could potentially provoke an arms race, particularly if both nations are unwilling to reduce their respective plutonium stockpiles. Lastly, the withdrawal could significantly impact other areas of cooperation, such as future arms control negotiations and collaborative efforts in managing nuclear risks globally. Conclusion Russia's decision to withdraw from the Plutonium Disposal Treaty, while not an invasion of treaty provisions, raises troubling questions about nuclear security and non-proliferation efforts. The move potentially threatens global security by increasing mistrust between the powers and undermining confidence in the international non-proliferation regime. As such, it is essential for the remaining parties to the treaty to engage in diplomatic dialogue and seek alternative mechanisms to avoid regional and global escalation of conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eric always arrived at work earlier than Jason, as","completion":"he was a firm believer in the saying, \\"The early bird catches the worm.\\" Jason, on the other hand, was more of a night owl, believing that his best work was done in the quiet solitude of the late hours. Their contrasting work styles fostered a light-hearted rivalry between the two, with each often trying to prove the merits of their own preferred schedule. However, their boss, Susan, appreciated the diversity in their work habits as this ensured that someone was always available to address any urgent matters. With Eric being an excellent problem-solver and Jason being known for his impeccable attention to detail, the pair complemented each other perfectly, creating a balanced and effective team. One Monday morning, Eric reached the office at 6:30 AM, as always, to find an email from a client requesting urgent amendments to a project. He knew that Jason, who was adept at proofreading even the most complex documents, wouldn't be at work until 9:30 AM, but made the decision to tackle some of the changes himself to save time. As the sun climbed higher into the sky and daylight flooded the cozy office, Eric felt proud of the progress he had made on the project, thankful that he always had a head start on the day. When Jason arrived, Eric excitedly showed him the changes he'd made, eager for his partner's input. Jason immediately noticed that, while Eric had addressed many of the client's pressing concerns, a few critical errors had been introduced. With his keen eye, Jason pinpointed errors in grammar, formatting, and even some inconsistencies in the data. He knew that, with their powers combined, they could polish the document to perfection. The two colleagues spent the rest of the morning resolving those issues and improving the project together. After a final review, they sent it back to the client with confidence. Just as they wrapped up the task, Susan entered the office, pleased to see them working harmoniously together. She congratulated them on another successful project and reminded them that, while their individual strengths were valuable, collaboration was the real key to the team's success. Later that evening, after most of the staff had gone home, Jason continued to work on his own projects, taking advantage of the quiet office space. He made formidable progress, but after encountering a complicated problem he wished he could discuss with Eric, he realized the importance of maintaining a balance in his schedule as well. The next day, Jason decided to adjust his arrival time, coming in a little earlier to overlap with Eric's schedule, while still maintaining some of his cherished late-night work sessions for more focused tasks. Eric, too, started staying just a bit later, recognizing the value in having someone to collaborate with throughout the day. This compromise allowed them to utilize their individual strengths and better support one another. As the weeks went on, their collaborative efforts led the team to new heights of success. Their projects consistently exceeded client expectations, and the office developed a reputation for efficiency, attention to detail, and clear communication. Eric and Jason's once-rivalry blossomed into a strong partnership built on mutual respect and understanding. This redefined relationship cast ripples throughout the entire office. Staff members began to appreciate the individual strengths of each team member, and the work environment transformed into an increasingly cooperative and productive space. Susan couldn't have been more proud of her team, and more importantly, the lessons they had taught one another about the importance of balance and unity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: make off with a small painting in her oversized purse B: accuse Addison of stealing the paintings without proof C: ask Addison questions about the value of the paintings Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it is difficult to predict exactly what Sasha will do next. However, we can analyze and compare the given options to determine which one best aligns with the provided context. A: Make off with a small painting in her oversized purse - This option implies that Sasha is intending to steal a painting from Addison's collection. The context does not provide any information about Sasha's moral character or intentions, so we cannot assume that she would commit theft just because she is browsing Addison's collection. B: Accuse Addison of stealing the paintings without proof - This option suggests that Sasha would make a serious accusation against Addison without having any evidence to support her claim. Again, the context does not provide any indication about Sasha's character or her relationship with Addison, so we cannot assume she would make such an accusation. C: Ask Addison questions about the value of the paintings - This option is the most appropriate given the context. Since Sasha is browsing through Addison's collection of rare and precious art paintings, it is reasonable for her to be curious about the value of those paintings.

Please answer the following question: Background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. Paragraph: Tony and Greg are brothers. They are currently in the kitchen eating a snack together. Greg is eating a stalk of celery while Tony is eating out of a bowl of candy. Tony remarks that he doesn't know how Greg enjoys such a bland snack. Greg just gives Tony an angry glare before getting up to go into the living room. On the living room table, Greg finds a glass of milk and a bowl of milk. The glass of milk has started to get thick, but the bowl of milk appears to be still fresh. Greg rolls his eyes at the mess and walks away. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person will experience more tooth decay? Answer:","completion":"Tony is likely to experience more tooth decay. This is because, Tony is eating candy which is high in sugars. The bacteria in the mouth use these sugars for energy and produce lactic acid as a waste product. The lactic acid can cause tooth decay because it harms the tooth enamel, which is the protective outer layer of the teeth, leading to the formation of cavities. On the other hand, Greg is eating a stalk of celery, which contains lower amounts of sugar. Therefore, the bacteria in his mouth have less sugar to convert to lactic acid, reducing the potential for tooth decay. So, comparing their current diets, Tony's high sugar intake increases his risk of tooth decay, while Greg's low-sugar snack reduces his risk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose less sugar produced happens, how will it affect more sugar produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If less sugar (glucose) is produced in a plant due to any perturbation such as a change in light intensity, nutrient availability, or carbon dioxide levels, it will have a direct effect on the amount of sugar that can be produced in the future. This is because the glucose produced in plants serves multiple purposes, such as providing energy (ATP) for different processes, including the mechanisms that lead to even more sugar production. If less glucose is produced, the plant's energy availability is compromised, which can result in reduced efficiency and capacity for photosynthesis. This can lead to even less sugar production in the future. In conclusion, less sugar production due to any perturbation can have a direct negative effect on the potential for producing more sugar in the future (a \\"less\\" effect).

If \\"The young boy with nice pants, a belt, and a tie is jumping off the steps\\", does this mean that \\"The nicely dressed boy jumps off the steps.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The young boy with nice pants, a belt, and a tie is jumping off the steps\\" can be accurately paraphrased as \\"The nicely dressed boy jumps off the steps.\\" In the original sentence, the description of the young boy focuses on his attire, specifically mentioning nice pants, a belt, and a tie. By specifying these elements of his outfit, the sentence conveys the idea that the young boy is dressed nicely or formally. In the paraphrased sentence, the descriptive details are summarized as \\"nicely dressed,\\" which effectively captures the overall impression of the boy's appearance. The action, \\"jumping off the steps,\\" remains the same in both sentences, maintaining the core meaning. Both sentences share the same underlying message: a young boy, who is dressed nicely, is performing the action of jumping off the steps. However, the paraphrased sentence presents this information more succinctly by using the phrase \\"nicely dressed\\" instead of listing each individual clothing item. This shorter version still conveys the same image and meaning while being more concise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Context: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K.

Barenaked Ladies and Ben Folds Five try to make the ‘Last Summer’ count Barenaked Ladies with frontman Ed Robertson (center right). Barenaked Ladies and Ben Folds Five are currently roaming the country on a jaunt called “Last Summer on Earth” tour, which comes to the Bank of America Pavilion on Tuesday. Do they know something we don’t? “We actually started the tour last year,” says BNL frontman Ed Robertson, noting that 2012 was the year the Mayan calendar predicted the end of the world. “This year, we’re just hedging our bets. Maybe the Mayans forgot to carry the one or something and maybe it ends this year. We’re going to keep doing the ‘Last Summer on Earth’ tour until the world ends. And then we’ll say, ‘See, told you so!’ ’’ Both groups are promoting new releases, the excellent “Grinning Streak” for Canada’s BNL and the live album from the reunited-in-2011 piano pop trio BFF. The longtime mutual admirers are excited to be out together. “We’re bands that grew up and cut our teeth together,” says Robertson of BFF and Guster. (The Boston-spawned group is appearing on almost all the other dates on the “Last Summer” tour but skipped Boston in favor of opening for Dispatch last month at the Comcast Center.) We recently chatted with Robertson and Folds from a Columbus, Ohio, tour stop, posing questions both serious and silly. Q. You both have blatant untruths in your name. Which is worse, that Ben Folds Five is a trio or the dearth of nude females in BNL? ROBERTSON: What’s funny is my high school band was called Three Guys From Barrie and there were five of us. And none of us were from Barrie so it was doubly misleading. FOLDS: They’re both pretty bad names. If you’ve never heard of either one of our bands they could sort of exist on some lounge marquee at a Four Seasons somewhere and people would say “God, what a [expletive] name.” I think once you make records, there’s an association with it and then it’s good. I like that both names are playful because what else are you going to do? Q. In a “Battle of the Network Stars”-type competition, who is the victor among your bands? ROBERTSON: I would have to say Guster would be our strongest competition — Brian Rosenworcel, Adam Gardner, Luke Reynolds — there are three physical specimens to be reckoned with. I’ve totally ruled Ben Folds Five out, they’re not even in the competition. I think it’s definitely between Guster and Barenaked Ladies, and ultimately we get inside their heads and we win. FOLDS: We don’t have enough people for that. [BFF drummer] Darren [Jessee] doesn’t really like to move. [Bassist] Robert [Sledge] is pretty strong. I just don’t weigh enough. On tug-of-war they’d just yank my ass across the line. ROBERTSON: Hey, what are you trying to say, Ben? Q. That you’re strong and powerful? ROBERTSON: No he’s trying to say we weigh a lot. [Laughs.] FOLDS: You’re tall and built. ROBERTSON: It’s true we are the tallest band in rock ’n’ roll. We have three guys over 6 feet. Q. How about in a more brain-teaser-like competition such as Scrabble? ROBERTSON: That’s tough. I think the last men at the board would be myself, [Guster frontman] Ryan Miller, and Ben. But among us I’m probably the only one who has read Stefan Fatsis’s book about Scrabble and also narrated a documentary on Scrabble, so I may have a competitive edge. FOLDS: I’m not really very good at Scrabble. I think Robert probably would be. If I had the help of my girlfriend I could kick all of y’all’s asses. Q. Are there songs in each other’s catalogs you wish you’d written? FOLDS: “Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did,” I think that’s a neat lyric [from “Brian Wilson.”] In fact, I guess I thought I’d wished I’d written enough to where I have a similar sounding cadence in a line on a song called “Rockin’ the Suburbs,” “just like Jon Bon Jovi did.” There’s something funny about putting “did” at the end of the sentence, it’s real conversational. It’s also got a melancholy feel to the lyric while the song sounds happy and I like that. ROBERTSON: I love “Army.” I try to catch it every night. It’s such a great song, it’s a such a great story. I will often make a mixtape-type playlist for somebody to describe the kind of music that I like and that’s always one that I put on there. I think the lyrics come across totally conversational, nothing seems forced. Q. The a cappella competition “The Sing-Off,” on which Ben serves as a judge, is returning to NBC this winter. Ed will you pledge right now to bring BNL on the show for a sing-off? ROBERTSON: We’ve been talking about organizing a freestyle rap battle between me, Ben, and Ryan. I think it would be pretty killer. [Ben laughs.] FOLDS: I’ll do that. I think the Barenaked Ladies could kill on an a cappella show. ROBERTSON: We’re actually working up an a cappella version of “Army” right now. FOLDS: It’s a shoo-in, they’re on. Q. Ben when you toured with Guster and Rufus Wainwright, you and Rufus did a great version of “Careless Whisper” by Wham! Will you all be doing any onstage collaborations like that? ROBERTSON: You guys do “Careless Whisper”? Dude, we do “Careless Whisper”! I think we might’ve done “Careless Whisper” with Guster back in the day. FOLDS: When you say back in the day, how far back? ROBERTSON: Oh God, probably late ’60s, early ’70s. FOLDS: OK, well that’s definitely after ours because ours was in the ’30s and it was only a wire recording. ROBERTSON: You know what, we recorded it with the Guster guys and now I’m remembering it originally came out on player piano rolls. It was originally arranged for hurdy-gurdy. FOLDS: Yeah, well it wasn’t called “Careless Whisper” back when we did it. It was called “Unga Unga Un” and it was some rocks smashed together. Q. Now that you’ve found this common ground, is it possible that you’ll perform together? ROBERTSON: Ben has been out to rock a little piano with us and he has an open invite, and I hope he will take advantage of it more.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

The lighting was far too dim, making it difficult to read our menus without using our phone flashlights. The tables and chairs seemed cramped together, restricting space for movement and conversation. We waited quite a while to be seated, even though there seemed to be plenty of empty tables. Once seated, our server took more than 15 minutes to acknowledge our presence. When we finally flagged her down, she seemed annoyed and inattentive. We ordered our drinks and, after waiting for another 20 minutes, we decided to make do with the free water provided and proceed with ordering our food. Unfortunately, the disappointing experience continued when our food finally arrived. My pasta dish was overcooked and swimming in a watery sauce. My friend's burger was burnt, and the vegetables accompanying it were wilted and lifeless. We called our server's attention to these issues, but we were met with little sympathy or effort to resolve the problem. To make matters worse, when the bill came, they had charged us for the drinks we had never received. We were too exhausted by then to make a fuss, so we paid the bill and simply left. Overall, The Hasty Hare failed to provide the enjoyable dining experience we had hoped for.

If you encounter difficult stains that do not come off with a commercial cleaner, paint thinner applied with steel wool can help. Make sure to follow package directions, especially any safety instructions, before applying paint thinner. Then, work the paint thinner into the frames using a steel wool sponge until the stains come off. Be gentle when using steel wool to avoid scratching the frames. Some steel wool pads have soap built in that can help you clean. After cleaning your frames, they may look a little dull. Apply water using fine steel wool, buffing the surface of the frames until they shine. Outdoor frames may become dull due to a process called anodizing. This looks similar to rust and cannot be polished off. Aluminum frames that appear rusty should be treated by a professional cleaner. Never apply any product, even household products, to the full window frame without testing them first. Before applying a product to your window frame, apply it to a small portion of the frame that's mostly out of sight.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Lookalike Mimics Ichiro, Gains National Recognition As Ichiro Suzuki approaches Pete Rose's professional baseball record of 4,256 hits, the Marlins' outfielder has understandably some found himself with some serious scrutiny. Some would argue that whenever Suzuki gets his next two hits – after a 3-for-4 performance against the Padres on Monday, he stands at 4,255 total – he will become the true hits king. But others – including Rose himself – might argue that because 1,278 of Ichiro's hits came in Japan before he entered MLB as a 27-year-old in 2001, Rose will remain the real king due to his numbers coming strictly against MLB competition. Ultimately that debate will probably last far beyond whenever Ichiro surpasses Rose's professional mark. But one thing that can't be argued is the skill of a Marlins fan who has nailed an absolutely perfect imitation of Suzuki. In this video posted by MLB.com, the fan's talents were put on display to the public during the Marlins' 13-4 win on Monday. Although the clip only shows one of Ichiro's at-bats, the fan was going to work all night long, earning the attention of sports fans everywhere for his spotless work. And perhaps it gives the Marlins some solace in knowing that whenever the Hall-of-Fame-bound 42-year old finally does retire, they'll have a perfectly suitable replacement waiting in the wings. But until then, Ichiro – whose .350 batting average in 2016 would be the highest of all-time for a player past the age of 40 if it holds – will continue to embark on the record books. Even without accounting for his hits from Japan, Suzuki stands at 2,977 in his MLB career entering Tuesday, only 23 shy of becoming the 30th player in MLB history to join the 3,000 hit club.

Some people think he will be the new record holder, but others don't because some of his hits were in Japan before he played in the United States. There is also a fan who is really good at pretending to be Ichiro. He got a lot of attention because he looks and acts just like him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Die Notwendigkeit der Steigerung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit ist eine fundamentale Voraussetzung für eine robuste Wirtschaft, die in der Lage ist, globale Herausforderungen zu meistern. Einer der Hauptgründe für diese Notwendigkeit ist der immer härter werdende internationale Wettbewerb, der Länder dazu zwingt, ihre Ressourcen zu optimieren und ihre Produktivität zu steigern, um im globalen Marktplatz relevant zu bleiben. Die Steigerung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit kann durch mehrere Strategien erreicht werden. Dazu gehören unter anderem die Förderung von Innovation, die Verbesserung der Infrastruktur, die Erhöhung der qualifizierten Arbeitskräfte, die Verringerung von gesetzlichen Beschränkungen und die Förderung einer wettbewerbsorientierten Unternehmenskultur. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass alle diese Faktoren miteinander verknüpft sind und dass ihre Integration auf nationaler Ebene notwendig ist, um eine nachhaltige Wettbewerbsfähigkeit zu gewährleisten. Zum Beispiel führt die Förderung von Innovation und technologischer Entwicklung unserer Industrien nicht nur zu gesteigerter Produktivität, sondern kann auch zur Schaffung neuer Arbeitsplätze und zur Stärkung der nationalen Wirtschaft beitragen. Die Verbesserung der Infrastruktur - ob physikalisch, wie Straßen und Telekommunikationsnetze, oder soziale, wie Bildung und Gesundheitswesen - ist ebenfalls ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Verbesserung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Sie ermöglicht nicht nur den reibungslosen Transport von Gütern und Dienstleistungen, sondern trägt auch zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität der Bürger bei und macht das Land attraktiver für ausländische Investitionen. Darüber hinaus ist die Ausbildung und Qualifizierung von Arbeitskräften ein kritischer Faktor. Es ist unerlässlich, in die Erziehung und Bildung der Bevölkerung zu investieren, um eine qualifizierte Arbeitskraft zu schaffen, die in der Lage ist, die Herausforderungen des globalen Marktes zu meistern. Die Reduzierung von gesetzlichen Beschränkungen und die Förderung einer wettbewerbsorientierten Unternehmenskultur können auch dazu beitragen, die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit zu steigern, indem sie Unternehmern und Unternehmen mehr Freiheit und Flexibilität geben, um zu wachsen und sich zu entwickeln. Durch die Umsetzung dieser Strategien und Maßnahmen können wir unsere Wirtschaft stärken und sie widerstandsfähiger gegenüber globalen Herausforderungen machen.

Drake is now a member of military intelligence trying to track down what he believes is a sabotage ring led by a Paul Narvo. A bomber and its pilots crashed the day before.

Chan goes to see Drake the next day at the apartment of George Kirby, where a dinner party is in progress. He finds his friend dead of poison gas in Drake's library, where he had gone to do some work. Drake's briefcase, containing all the information he had gathered about the sabotage ring, is missing. The window is latched, so Chan concludes one of the guests is responsible. Chan discovers that Drake asked that his Oxford classmate Herbert Fenton, actress June Preston and Ralph Percy, chief designer at the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, be invited to the party.

This part of the tweet implies that the individual is currently en route to the airport, which is generally associated with an upcoming departure from the city.

The user is expressing their desire to remain in New York, which may indicate a strong attachment to the city, or perhaps their enjoyment of the experiences they had there. When we put these two parts together, the overall sentiment conveys a sense of sadness and wistfulness at the prospect of leaving New York, even as they prepare to depart from LaGuardia Airport.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What can damage trees? Context: It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position. Answer:","completion":"Damage to trees can be caused by broken limbs or roots, deep wounds from fire, insects (specifically their larvae), or falling timber. These damages can allow decay to enter and spread throughout the tree, and the tunnels created by insect larvae can remain as sources of weakness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When someone says, \\"Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music\\", it does not mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do?

AFP - Pauline Hanson, the former leader of Australia's xenophobic One Nation party, has announced that she was coming back from political retirement to run for a seat in the Senate next month.","completion":"This announcement is about Pauline Hanson, the previous leader of Australia's One Nation party, who has decided to return from political retirement and contest for a seat in Australia's Senate in the upcoming elections. One Nation is a far-right political party that has been known to propagate policies targeting immigration and multiculturalism. In recent years, the party has gained notoriety for advocating anti-immigration and anti-Muslim sentiments. Pauline Hanson, born on May 27, 1954, in Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia, is an Australian politician who has been involved in politics since the 1990s. Hanson initially became a member of the Liberal Party of Australia before being disendorsed due to her controversial comments on indigenous Australians and immigration. Despite being disendorsed, she went on to win a seat in the Australian Parliament as an independent in 1996. In 1997, she co-founded and became the leader of the One Nation party. During her time in politics, Hanson has been known for holding and espousing far-right views. Her maiden speech in the Australian Parliament is still considered one of the most controversial speeches in Australian history, where she advocated anti-immigration policies and claimed that Australia was being \\"swamped by Asians.\\" Over the years, Hanson has been criticized for promoting extremist views, which led to her being involved in several political controversies. After a hiatus in her political career, Pauline Hanson decided to come out of retirement and run for a seat in the Senate in the next month's elections. Her re-emergence in the political landscape speaks to the resurgence of far-right movements and anti-immigration sentiment not only in Australia but in many countries around the world. Hanson's return to politics could potentially have an impact on several policies related to immigration, religious freedoms, and cultural diversity if she gets elected into the Senate. As a political figure, she has previously voiced concerns about the effects of immigration, particularly from Muslim-majority countries, on Australia's social fabric and economy. Her participation in the Senate race might increase the attention and focus on those issues during the election campaigns. In summary, this announcement is about Pauline Hanson, a far-right Australian politician and former leader of the One Nation party, who has decided to contest for a seat in the Senate after coming back from political retirement.

Write a question about the following article: The Finnish Red Guards seized the early initiative in the war by taking control of Helsinki on 28 January 1918 and by undertaking a general offensive lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were relatively well armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at the command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalise on this momentum, and most of the offensives came to nothing. The military chain of command functioned relatively well at company and platoon level, but leadership and authority remained weak as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troops. The common troops were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low. Ali Aaltonen was replaced on 28 January 1918 by Eero Haapalainen as commander-in-chief. He, in turn, was displaced by the Bolshevik triumvirate of Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta on 20 March. The last commander-in-chief of the Red Guard was Kullervo Manner, from 10 April until the last period of the war when the Reds no longer had a named leader. Some talented local commanders, such as Hugo Salmela in the Battle of Tampere, provided successful leadership, but could not change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, such as against German troops in the Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28-29 April in Tuulos.","completion":"What problems did the Finnish Red Guards face during their offensives in the war, despite being well-armed, and how did their leadership change throughout the conflict?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If your plant is an air bromeliad, you probably purchased it attached to driftwood or another object, placed in a pot that contained pure bark or rocks instead of soil or potting mix, or by itself with no attachment at all. These plants draw moisture and nutrients from the air around them. They are especially hardy compared to other bromeliads, but you should keep an eye out to deal with problems early. Most air bromeliads cannot draw moisture or nutrients through the roots at all, and only need to be placed in dry bark so it has crevices to attach to and hold itself upright. Smaller varieties can even be attached to driftwood, pebbles, or other objects. Before placing on object under your bromeliad, if you suspect it has been exposed to saltwater, immerse the object in distilled water or rainwater for two weeks, changing the water frequently. Some bromeliads sold as air bromeliads may have more extensive root systems, either because they are larger and require more support, or because they can draw moisture from both air and water. Plant these in a mix of 1 part perlite and 2 parts bromeliad potting mix, and occasionally moisten around the base of the plant if the leaves look dry. Air bromeliads tend to originate in desert environments and can take more sunlight than other varieties, but this is not true of every species. Keep it in front of an east- or north-facing window for indirect sunlight, or move it to a west- or south-facing window for full sun and keep a close eye out for dry leaves. Most air bromeliads are small and thus make easy indoor plants, but they can be kept outside. They tend to be hardier than other varieties, but will do best in warm weather and should be brought inside before the frost hits. If you are in the Southern Hemisphere, the south-facing window will get indirect sunlight, and the north-facing one receives direct sunlight. You may also need to adjust to a different window if there are hills or a mountain slope nearby. See Troubleshooting for signs your plant has too little or too much sun exposure. Air bromeliads require extra moisture from the air. Use a spray bottle to mist the surface of the plant once every few days. It may require misting daily or every other day if kept in an arid indoor environment or during a dry season. Do not water the base of the plant unless another step tells you to in specific situations. Air bromeliads do not primarily use its roots to draw up water, and standing water could cause them to rot. Use distilled or bottled water in the sprayer for the best results. Bromeliads grow slowly and do not typically require fertilizer. If you want to encourage blooming or rapid growth, you can attempt to fertilize it infrequently, no more than once every two weeks at the very most. Air plants can only be fertilized using liquid fertilizer, since they do not draw nutrients through their roots. Always dilute one part liquid fertilizer with one to three parts water before spraying. When your bromeliad eventually flowers, which can take years and last several months, it will produce \\"pups\\", or young buds. Use a disinfected knife to cut off dead flowers or spiky flower-supporting structures when they become unattractive, and to remove the buds when they have grown for several months or the plant begins to die. Disinfect the blade with rubbing alcohol before cutting and take care not to injure the main plant body.

Which is a genus of tree, Chilopsis or Aristotelia?","completion":"Chilopsis is a genus of tree, while Aristotelia is not. Chilopsis belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is native to the southwestern United States and Mexico. There is only one species in this genus, Chilopsis linearis, commonly known as the desert willow or desert catalpa due to its willow-like leaves and beautiful trumpet-shaped flowers. The tree is well-adapted to arid environments and typically found in desert washes and along dry riverbanks. On the other hand, Aristotelia doesn't represent a genus of trees but belongs to a genus of flowering plants, called Aristotelia chilensis, known as maqui or Chilean wineberry. These plants are native to South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. Maqui produces small, dark purple berries which are highly valued for their antioxidant properties and use in traditional medicine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given those answer options, answer the question: U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had instructed his representatives not to sign a communique by all seven leaders attending the G-7 summit in Canada, citing statements by Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made after he left. \\"Very dishonest and & weak,\\" Trump tweeted in response to Trudeau's remark that the new U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel were \\"insulting.\\" \\"Based on Justin's false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers, and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\\" Trump added. \\"International cooperation cannot be dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks,\\" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement about Trump's withdrawal from signing the communique. The statement also said Trump's action is a display of \\"incoherence and inconsistency.\\" \\"Germany stands by the jointly agreed communique,\\" Germany spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement. Trudeau closed the summit Saturday by refusing to budge on positions that place him at odds with Trump, particularly new tariffs on steel and aluminum that have irritated Canada and the European Union. He said in closing remarks that Canada would proceed with retaliatory measures on U.S. goods as early as July 1. \\"I highlighted directly to the president that Canadians did not take it lightly that the United States has moved forward with significant tariffs,\\" Trudeau said in the news conference following the two-day summit. \\"Canadians, we're polite, we're reasonable, but we will also not be pushed around.\\" British Prime Minister Theresa May echoed Trudeau, pledging to retaliate for tariffs on EU goods. \\"The loss of trade through tariffs undermines competition, reduces productivity, removes the incentive to innovate and ultimately makes everyone poorer,\\" she said. \\"And in response, the EU will impose countermeasures.\\" Trudeau and May also bucked... Question: What does Steffen Seibert personally think about allowing Russia re-join the G-8? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"The provided text does not contain any information on what Steffen Seibert, the German spokesman, personally thinks about allowing Russia to re-join the G-8. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately attribute an opinion or stance on this particular matter to Steffen Seibert from the information given. In the provided excerpt, Seibert is quoted as stating that Germany stands by the communique that was jointly agreed upon at the G-7 summit, a statement made in response to U.S. President Donald Trump instructing his representatives not to sign the communique following disputes over tariffs. These disputes involved Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, among others, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the newly imposed American tariffs on steel and aluminum. Notably, Trudeau declared that Canada would enact retaliatory tariff measures against U.S. goods. The fallout over these economically-potent disagreements was significant -- they led to the U.S. rejecting the very concept of solidarity represented by the joint signing of the communique. However, Steffen Seibert's comments were specifically related to the discussions and outcomes of that summit, not about the question of allowing Russia to re-join what was previously known as the G-8 (it became the G-7 after Russia's membership was suspended in 2014 as a result of the country's annexation of Crimea). The information given does not include any mention of this clearly separate and highly charged geopolitical issue. Given the importance and potential sensitivity of both these subjects – international trade and tariffs, and Russia's status in relation to this group of leading industrial nations – it would be important to seek out precise and objective information about Steffen Seibert's perspective on the latter issue from a reputable source. Drawing assumptions or conclusions without such information could lead to factual inaccuracies or misinterpretations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, things begin to unravel when a series of errors within the gang's activities catches the attention of an ambitious young journalist named Sarah Mitchell, who's determined to uncover the truth and expose the real Ben Wade. Yearning for a life-changing story that would boost her career and fulfill her ambitions, Sarah delves deep into the criminal underworld, following leads and connecting the dots, all leading her closer to the notorious gang. However, she realizes the truth she seeks may be more difficult to unravel than she first believed. As Sarah digs deeper, it becomes apparent that Ben Wade has made some influential enemies. A charismatic and powerful mob boss named Marco D'Amico is angling for control of the city's criminal underworld and is not afraid to challenge Wade's previous dominance. With Wade's gang weakened by police infiltration and increasing infighting, it is the perfect moment for D'Amico to make his move. On the other side of the law, a seasoned detective, Jack Dawson, has spent his whole career chasing after the gang, determined to bring them to justice. He's made incredible sacrifices, allowing his personal life to crumble in his pursuit of justice. Believing that capturing Ben Wade's gang would be his career-defining achievement, he finds a renewed sense of hope when Sarah Mitchell's investigation offers new leads and insights. As multiple interests converge on Ben Wade, he must adapt and prove his cunning and ruthlessness to protect his empire. Themes of loyalty, betrayal, and power come to light as the gang faces a coup from within, led by a disgruntled and ambitious second-in-command, Vincent Moreno. With the city spiraling into chaos and rival gangs vying for power, Sarah Mitchell works together with Detective Dawson to navigate the complex web of motives and loyalties, leading them closer to the mysterious leader of the Ben Wade gang. Together, they must also dodge the dangers of the criminal underworld, avoiding vengeful mobsters, corrupt law enforcement, and even the dangerous allure of getting too close to Wade's empire. As the plot climaxes, the power struggle reaches a boiling point. Cornered and with nothing left to lose, Wade confronts Marco D'Amico in an intense and violent standoff. Meanwhile, relying on Sarah's investigative findings, Detective Dawson finally uncovers the enigmatic identity of the leader. The film concludes with a thrilling sequence where Sarah and Dawson must decide whether to expose Ben Wade and bring the gang to justice at the cost of sparking even more chaos and possible bloodshed or to let him and his empire crumble naturally amidst the power struggle.

Choices: [i] no [ii] yes","completion":"[ii] yes Both sentences describe a scenario in which a family stops for lunch at Freshwater Spit and several children go to the water's edge to play in the surf. The first sentence provides a more detailed description of the event, specifying the time (shortly after noon). The second sentence reiterates the main idea but places emphasis on the 8-year-old child being among those who went to play in the surf. Despite their slight differences, these two sentences convey the same fundamental information. As a result, if the first sentence is true, the second one is also true. Factors like the timing of the event or the age of the children do not contradict each other. Instead, they complement the overall narrative, painting a more vivid picture of a family enjoying a day at the beach.

Please answer the following question: Article: Facebook friends cannot replace the real thing, say psychologists . People are happier and laugh 50% more when they talk face to face with friends or via webcam (web camera) than when they use social networking sites, a study has found. Dr. Roberts, a famous lecture at the University of Chester, said such websites don't appear to help make true friendships. Based on two questionnaires , he found there was no link between Facebook use and people with larger groups of friends. Dr. Roberts, whose work will be presented at the British Psychological Society conference in Harrogate, said, \\"The bottom lime conclusion is that our relationships are not dependent on the quantity of communication. They depend on quality, and even Skype is better at increasing the quality of our communication than time on Facebook.\\" Even talking on the phone or texting does not make people feel as good as sharing a smile, the research says. The studies suggest quality, not quantity, of communication is the most important for keeping friends for life. People find the most satisfying relationships come from a small number of close friends, with an outer \\"ring\\" of 10 significant others. With these people, it doesn't matter what type of social media you use for communication.

Question: suppose there is less of a current happens, how will it affect LESS snow. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"To answer the question, let us analyze the process step-by-step: Step 1: The air is cold. Step 2: Water is in the air. Step 3: The water forms tiny ice crystals. Step 4: The ice crystals collide with each other. Step 5: The ice crystals stick to each other. Step 6: The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together. Step 7: The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air. Step 8: The ice crystals become snowflakes. Step 9: The snowflakes fall to the ground as snow. Now, let's consider the situation where there is less of a current (air movement). Less air movement would mean less chance for ice crystals to collide with each other (Step 4). This would make it harder for ice crystals to stick to each other and grow in size (Steps 5 and 6). As a result, there would be fewer instances of ice crystals growing too large and becoming too heavy to remain in the air (Step 7). This would ultimately lead to fewer instances of ice crystals turning into snowflakes and falling to the ground as snow (Steps 8 and 9). So, in a situation with less of a current, the correct answer is: B: less snow"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Samantha loves doing interesting activities outside the most usually.; B). Betty loves doing interesting activities outside the most usually.;","completion":"B). Betty loves doing interesting activities outside the most usually. Betty had always been an outdoor enthusiast, finding joy and solace in the natural world. She was passionate about hiking, camping, and exploring all the wonders that Mother Nature had to offer. On the other hand, Samantha, her close friend, was an expert angler who had a wealth of knowledge and experience in all things related to fishing. Seeing Betty's excitement for outdoor adventures, Samantha thought it would be a perfect opportunity to introduce her friend to the sport of fishing. Samantha knew that fishing would not only provide Betty with an enjoyable way to spend her time outdoors but also offer her a new skill that she could cultivate and develop further. To begin with, Samantha decided to share information about the basics of fishing with Betty. She explained the various techniques used in both freshwater and saltwater fishing, elaborated on the different types of fishing rods and equipment available, along with their respective advantages and drawbacks. Betty listened intently, soaking in every bit of knowledge that her friend had to offer. As the weekend approached, Samantha planned a trip to a nearby lake that was known for its abundance of fish. Before hitting the water, she made sure to equip Betty with the right fishing gear, including a sturdy rod, a tackle box filled with various hooks, lures, and other necessary equipment, as well as clothing suitable for spending long hours outdoors. On the day of the fishing trip, Samantha and Betty set out early in the morning to catch the first light and make the most of their day. Once they reached the picturesque lake, Samantha helped Betty set up her fishing rod, demonstrating the appropriate techniques for tying knots, attaching the bait, and casting the line into the water. As the sun rose, the two friends enjoyed the serene ambience, waiting patiently for the fish to bite. Betty leaned on Samantha's expertise as they engaged in conversation about various topics, learning more about diverse species of fish as well as the importance of respecting the environment and practicing sustainable fishing. It wasn't long before Betty felt a tug on her line. With her heart racing, she followed Samantha's instructions, gently reeling in the fish to avoid breaking the line. Finally, the moment of truth arrived as Betty successfully landed her first-ever fish. Her eyes sparkled with joy, and she couldn't contain her excitement. Samantha joined in the celebration, proud of her friend's accomplishment. Throughout the day, Betty continued to improve her fishing skills, reeling in more fish and growing increasingly confident in her abilities. As the sun began to set, the two friends decided it was time to head back. They packed their gear and began their journey home, reflecting on the fun and successful day they had shared. In the weeks and months that followed, Betty and Samanta planned more fishing trips together, each one providing new challenges and opportunities for growth. As Betty's skills flourished, so too did their friendship. Through their shared love for outdoor activities and the bonding experience that fishing offered, Samantha and Betty formed a deep and lasting connection that would endure for years to come. In teaching Betty the art of fishing, Samantha had not only imparted valuable knowledge and skills but had also fostered a love for the outdoors within her friend that would continue to fuel her spirit of adventure.

Answer this question: who was england's prime minister during ww1??","completion":"England's Prime Minister during World War 1 was David Lloyd George, who served as the Prime Minister from 1916 to 1922. Born on January 17, 1863, in Manchester, England, David Lloyd George was a key political figure during the early 20th century and played a pivotal role in the British war effort during WW1. David Lloyd George was a member of the Liberal Party, which he joined as a young man. He was initially elected as a Member of Parliament for Caernarfon Boroughs in 1890, a position he would hold until 1945. Before becoming Prime Minister, Lloyd George held various important positions in the government, such as the President of the Board of Trade, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Minister of Munitions. When World War 1 broke out in 1914, David Lloyd George initially served under Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's administration. During his time as Minister of Munitions and later as Secretary of State for War, he displayed exceptional administrative capabilities while overseeing the production and supply of armaments for the British forces. His efforts contributed to an increase in arms production, helping the British military to maintain a strong frontline against their enemies. On December 7, 1916, David Lloyd George became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after H. H. Asquith was forced to resign due to growing dissatisfaction with his leadership during the war. As Prime Minister, Lloyd George played a crucial role in strengthening the British war effort and led the country to victory in 1918. One of his most significant achievements was the establishment of a unified Allied command structure, which facilitated effective cooperation between British, French, and American forces. As a wartime Prime Minister, Lloyd George also faced the challenge of maintaining support for the war on the domestic front. He worked tirelessly to increase national morale, rallying the population to support the war effort and even implemented policies like food rationing to ensure the military's needs were met. Moreover, he played a key role in formulating the policies that aimed to address some of the root causes of the war, such as negotiating the Irish Home Rule issue. Following the end of World War 1 in November 1918, Lloyd George participated in the Paris Peace Conference, where the Treaty of Versailles was negotiated and signed in June 1919. During the negotiations, he played a balancing role between the harsher demands of France's Georges Clemenceau and the more moderate approach of the United States' Woodrow Wilson, thus shaping the peace terms imposed on Germany and the newly established international order. Lloyd George's tenure as the Prime Minister continued until October 19, 1922, when internal divisions within the Liberal Party and the wider political landscape led to the collapse of his coalition government. Despite his resignation, David Lloyd George is still remembered as one of the most important and influential British political figures of the 20th century, particularly for his leadership during World War 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It operated as a significant component of the United States' role in the war at that time, although the country did not officially join the fighting until 1917. On the night of July 30, 1916, a series of fires broke out at the munitions depot, which soon led to several catastrophic explosions. The cause of these fires and explosions is thought to have been a German sabotage operation. German agents had infiltrated the United States and were looking to disrupt the flow of arms and ammunition to the Allied forces, potentially altering the course of the war. The explosion was powerful enough to shatter windows in buildings as far as 25 miles away and was heard over 100 miles away. The destruction caused by the Black Tom Explosion stretched for miles, and several buildings in the surrounding areas were heavily damaged or outright destroyed. One such structure was the St. Patrick's Parish in Jersey City, located approximately 2-3 miles away from the explosion site. The building was severely damaged by the blast and subsequent shockwaves, with windows shattered, walls cracked, and portions of the structure utterly collapsing. The destruction caused by the extensive damage to St. Patrick's Parish necessitated considerable repairs, reconstruction, and renovations. This work was undertaken in the years following the explosion, with the church and its community ultimately recovering from the disaster. In conclusion, on July 30, 1916, the St. Patrick's Parish in Jersey City experienced significant damage, both structural and otherwise, due to the massive explosion at the Black Tom Island munitions depot. This event highlights the far-reaching impacts of the First World War, even affecting those who were not directly involved in the conflict and serves as a reminder of the extensive and tragic consequences of war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: LaDainian Tomlinson ran in two TDs and threw for one to give San Diego its third straight comeback win. He then had 21 rushing touchdowns on the year and brought his career QB record to 7 completions out of 10 attempts with 6 touchdowns. Philip Rivers, on the other hand, struggled completing 14 of 31 passes and throwing for only a 133 yards with no touchdowns and 1 interception. The Chargers swept the Raiders and had then won seven straight from Oakland. The scoring started with the Raiders making it 7-0 after a 1-yard pass from Aaron Brooks to Reshard Lee. The Chargers answered back when Antonio Cromartie returned the ensuing kick 91 yards, which set up a 2-yard run by LT to tie the score at 7-7 going into the half. The Raiders took the lead again on a catch and run by rookie John Madsen that set up a 2-yard pass from Brooks to Madsen to make it 14-7 Oakland. On 4th and 2, Rivers passed to Vincent Jackson for a first down, but Jackson proceeded to get up and throw the ball forward in celebration, but he hadn't been touched down. The initial ruling was that it was a fumble and Oakland's ball; however, after the officials got together for a conference they declared that since it was an illegal forward fumble that it was technically an illegal forward pass and San Diego was then given back the ball and penalized 5 yards, which was still enough for the first down. The game continued and on the next play, Rivers pitched the ball to Tomlinson as if it were a run play but then threw the ball to an open Antonio Gates to tie the score at 14-14. After forcing Oakland to punt, the Chargers drove down field and LT ran it in from 10 yards out to give the Chargers the 21-14 win. With the win, the Chargers had won 7 straight games over the Raiders and improved their record to 9-2. Question: How many times did the teams tie?

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who's a relative of Paul's partner in crime? ? Paul is a young womanizer living in a small Southern town, where he earns a living fixing cars for his uncle. Paul still lives with his mother, Elvira, who works as a clown cheering up children at the local hospital. He spends most of his time hanging out with his best friend and self-proclaimed partner-in-crime, Tip, and their friends Bo and Bust-Ass. Among his friends, Paul has a reputation as a ladies' man, but he is not at all known for being involved with long-term relationships; most of Paul's romances last only a few weeks, and he's slept with nearly every girl in town. Paul is beginning to reach a point where he would like to lead a different life, and that feeling becomes all the more clear when he meets Noel, Tip's teenage sister who returns home after attending a boarding school. Noel is more thoughtful and mature than the girls Paul is used to. Paul and Noel soon fall in love, but for Paul this is a different sort of relationship than he's accustomed to — Noel is still a virgin, and her contemplative nature gives him a desire to be a better, stronger person, but Tip does not approve of Paul dating his younger sister, which leads to a rift between these longtime friends.

Combine the connotations: Since \\"funny\\" is positive and \\"surprisingly\\" is neutral-leaning-positive in this context, the overall connotation of the phrase is positive. Conclusion: The phrase \\"a surprisingly funny movie\\" would be considered positive, as it implies the movie was unexpectedly entertaining or amusing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Now, I have a new situation: Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Arrange a time to sit down with your parents and ask for the money. You want your parents to know that you aren't taking this situation lightly, and you'd only be asking if you needed it. You'll come across as more serious and sincere if you set up a time beforehand, rather than having a quick phone call or just casually asking for the money in passing. Depending on how large a sum you're asking for, you might want to bring some paperwork to your discussion with your parents. Show them how you calculated the exact amount that you need. Indicate how much you've been able to save to pay for the item, then ask for the remaining amount. If you're asking for money for a specific item, find it online and print out the price. If you'd like extra money you can use as a cushion, be upfront about that. Tell them that if they give you a certain amount now, you'll be able to get on your feet and won't have to ask again. If you're going to pay them back, you might want to provide a printed installment plan or schedule they can keep. This shows that you're serious about making good on your promise. You probably have a fairly good picture of what your parents' finances are like. Still, it's better not to assume they can give or even loan you a large amount of money. Ask them if they feel comfortable with the amount you're asking for. They may tell you they simply can't afford it, or that they'd be able to give you a partial amount. Asking for money is a big favor, and your parents are entitled to making a few stipulations. They may say that they'll give you just a part of what you're asking for, or perhaps they'll say they can loan you the money if you pay it back within a short time. Your first inclination might be to get upset or angry that they didn't give you what you wanted with no strings attached. However, if you want or need the money, you'll have to accept what comes with it. It's possible that your parents will decline to give you the money. If that's the case, see if there's anything you can do to make them feel better about giving it to you. Is there a chore or job you could do in exchange for the money? See if you can make repairs, do the grocery shopping, or help out in some other way. If they still won't budge, don't beg. Instead, try to find another way to get money. If you show your parents you're resourceful, they may even decide to help you out. If your parents decide to give you the money, it's in your best interest to tell them thanks. If you're over eighteen, your parents are no longer obligated to support you financially, so the money they hand over is a gift. If you want to go above and beyond, you could even write them a thank-you note. Your attitude will make them feel more willing to help you out in the future.","completion":"To effectively ask your parents for financial assistance, it is crucial to maintain a sincere and organized approach. Begin by scheduling a designated time to sit down and discuss the matter with them, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and the fact that you would only be asking for help if it were absolutely necessary. When preparing for the conversation, gather documentation to support your request. This may include paperwork showing how you arrived at the needed sum, evidence of your personal savings contribution, and the exact cost of the item or service if applicable. If you desire extra funds for added security, be transparent about this. Clearly conveying your financial needs and goals will illustrate your commitment to responsibly addressing the situation. In presenting your case, remain considerate of your parents' financial circumstances and avoid making assumptions about their ability to provide assistance. Ask if they are comfortable with the amount you are requesting and be prepared to negotiate, keeping in mind that they have the right to establish conditions or offer partial support. If your parents agree to loan you the money and you intend to repay them, provide a printed repayment schedule to further demonstrate your dedication to fulfilling your promise. In the event they decline your request, explore alternative methods of earning the funds, such as offering to complete chores or tasks in exchange for the money. Demonstrating resourcefulness may persuade them to reconsider. Regardless of the outcome, express gratitude for any support they are able to provide. Remember that, if you are over eighteen years old, their financial assistance is a generous gift and not an obligation. Exhibiting a positive and appreciative attitude will not only strengthen your relationship but also increase the likelihood of their willingness to help in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If Encourage personal investment in postsecondary education, can we conclude that \\"If you don't encourage person investment in postsecondary education you will fail. \\"?","completion":"It is important not to jump to the conclusion that if you don't encourage personal investment in postsecondary education, you will necessarily fail. Encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education can bring numerous benefits, such as enhanced skills, career opportunities, and personal development. However, it is not the only factor that contributes to an individual's success or failure in life. The statement, \\"If you don't encourage personal investment in postsecondary education, you will fail,\\" makes an assumption that success is solely linked to postsecondary education, which is not the case. There are several factors and pathways that contribute to an individual's success in life, and postsecondary education may only be one of these factors. 1. Different learning styles and preferences: Not all individuals are suited to the traditional postsecondary education format, and they may learn better through alternative methods such as vocational training, apprenticeships, or on-the-job training. In these cases, personal investment in postsecondary education may not result in success if it doesn't align with their learning style and preferences. 2. Varied definitions of success: Everyone has different definitions of success. For some, success may be linked to obtaining a prestigious job or earning a specific salary, while for others, success could mean being content and satisfied with their work and personal life balance. Encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education is not universally applicable to achieve success, as it may not be the priority or goal for all individuals. 3. Availability of opportunities: Various factors can impact an individual's opportunities, such as socio-economic background, geographic location, and personal connections. Encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education may not be enough to guarantee success if an individual does not have equal access to opportunities and resources. 4. Importance of soft skills: While postsecondary education can certainly enhance an individual's technical skills and knowledge in a particular field, success in the workforce often depends on soft skills such as communication, collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability. These skills may not necessarily be developed through postsecondary education but can instead be nurtured through other experiences and personal development. 5. Changing job market: The rapidly changing job market and rise of various industries make it difficult to predict the long-term relevance of certain degrees or qualifications. Encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education may not guarantee success if the chosen field of study or occupation becomes obsolete in the future. Thus, while encouraging personal investment in postsecondary education can indeed contribute to an individual's likelihood of success, it is not the sole determinant. Success is multi-faceted and influenced by various factors. To develop a comprehensive approach towards success, it is important to consider individual goals, unique circumstances, and various pathways that align with an individual's strengths and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This post came to me at 10pm last night, on Day 16 of this challenge, after a day of holidaying in London and with my head (and feet) too weary to put finger to touchscreen. Mrs Mc and I had just watched another live instalment of Broadchurch, murder mystery extraordinaire, particularly since in the second series there is no actual fresh murder to investigate. The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music. This moment has even gained a moniker in British homes, based on the theme tune to the real masters of the four-times-a-week cliffhanger, London-based soap opera Eastenders. It's call a \\"ba...ba...ba...ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba\\" (YouTube will provide overseas readers with auditory explanation). Eastenders is such a master of writing in the perfect pace that every 28 minute episode ends with a tantalising screen freeze on the latest shocked face / smirking baddy / confused victim. For really big stories the cliffhanger can last significantly longer. This week, to celebrate the show's 30 year birthday, we will finally find out the answer to a question unanswered for the past 14 months: \\"Who killed Lucy Beale?\\" Now, most classrooms do not involve murder, incest, dodgy deals and danger, but \\"good teaching\\" encourages a type of pacing that totally ignores the ingredients that have millions in the edges of their seats every day: the good old cliffhanger. In fact, we see teachers giving away the punchline at the beginning: \\"Today we are learning this:...\\" Why does the drama have a cliffhanger? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. because the drama involves danger B. because the pacing encourages audience to keep watching for updates C. not enough information D. because the drama has tales to relate Answer:","completion":"B. because the pacing encourages audience to keep watching for updates Television dramas often employ the use of cliffhangers to keep the audience captivated and eager to follow the story. The whole point of a television drama is to bring viewers through an often slow start, followed by a complex development where there are multiple potential dénouements, eventually concluding with an end-of-episode cliffhanger. This structure ensures that the audience will have to wait until the next episode, or even longer, as in the case of Eastenders, to get the \\"right answer\\" or resolution to the mystery or storyline. The most important reason for this approach is because it effectively maintains the audience's interest. By incorporating engaging plot developments and storytelling devices like cliffhangers, the pacing of the drama encourages viewers to keep tuning in for updates. This is a key aspect to the success and longevity of popular television dramas, as a substantial and loyal audience is essential for their continued production. Furthermore, the use of cliffhangers can have an impact on the way viewers discuss, think, and analyze the content of television dramas. A compelling cliffhanger can prompt people to talk about the story with their friends, family or coworkers and engage them in speculation about upcoming events. This word-of-mouth promotion helps in expanding and maintaining the show's viewership, and sustains the audience's emotional investment in the series. Overall, the purpose of a cliffhanger in television drama is to effectively maintain the audience's attention by capitalizing on what they find most engaging about the story. By keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, the pacing encourages them to continue watching for updates, ultimately ensuring the drama's success and longevity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While significantly higher frequency of EGFR mutation was observed in TRU type, we found that the presence of EGFR mutations was a significant predictor of shorter postoperative survival for TRU type, independent of disease stage.

Her husband sends an independent cattle drover, called \\"Drover\\", to transport her to Faraway Downs. Lady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an Aboriginal elder, \\"King George\\". Meanwhile, cattle station manager Neil Fletcher is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs, so that Lesley 'King' Carney will have a complete cattle monopoly, giving him negotiating leverage with an Australian army officer, Captain Dutton, who wants to buy the cattle. The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah, who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah tells her that he has seen her cattle being driven onto Carney's land â in other words, stolen from her. Because of this Fletcher mistreats Nullah and threatens him and his mother, so Lady Sarah fires Fletcher and decides to try to run the cattle station herself. When Nullah and his mother hide from the authorities in a water tower, his mother drowns. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song \\"Over the Rainbow\\" from the film The Wizard of Oz. Nullah tells her that \\"King George\\" is his grandfather, and that like the Wizard, he too is a \\"magic man\\". Lady Sarah persuades Drover to take the cattle to Darwin for sale. Drover is friendly with the Aborigines, and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory. It is revealed that he was married to an Aboriginal woman, who died after being refused medical treatment in a hospital because of her race. Lady Sarah also reveals she is unable to have children. Drover leads a team of six other riders, including Lady Sarah, Drover's Aboriginal brother-in-law Magarri, Nullah, and the station's accountant Kipling Flynn, to drive the 1,500 cattle to Darwin.

Does the word \\"score\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"score\\" is used with two different meanings. It is important to analyze each sentence separately to understand the meanings in their respective contexts. 1. \\"Add it to my score and I'll settle later.\\" In this sentence, \\"score\\" refers to the total amount at which someone owes or is owed. Here, it is being used to express the total sum of a debt or credit. It is typically used when someone has an ongoing account or tab with a business, such as a bar, where they receive goods or services and pay for them at a later time. In this context, the speaker is asking to add the current transaction to their existing account, and they will pay for it later. 2. \\"A score were sent out but only one returned.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"score\\" has a different meaning. Here, \\"score\\" is being used as an alternative term to express 20 units of something, which is a well-known definition. This usage is based on the traditional counting system that was used in England long ago. In the given context, the term \\"score\\" is referring to the number of items or individuals sent out, which is equal to 20. The sentence is stating that 20 units of something were dispatched, but only one of those units made its way back. In conclusion, it is important to pay attention to the context in which a word is used, as it can often have multiple meanings or connotations. In the case of the word \\"score\\" in these two sentences, the first usage represents the total debt or credit sum, while the second one signifies a set of 20 units."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.

The statement primarily discusses the presence of subsidiary temples within the premises of the Govindaraja temple, such as the Parthasarathi temple and the Kalyana Venkateswara temple. Furthermore, it mentions the individual shrines for Pundarika Valli, Alwars, Lakshmi Narayana Swami, and others. Based on this context, it becomes apparent that the <MASK> token should be the name of a deity or a divine figure associated with these temples. Comparing the given options: Option A: இராமானுசர் (Ramanuja) - This name is already mentioned later in the same sentence, so it would not make logical sense to repeat it. Option B: விசுவாமித்திரருக்கும் (For Vishvamitra) - This word doesn't fit the context well, as the other names mentioned are mainly Vaishnavite figures and traditions, while Vishvamitra is not directly connected to the context of these temples as Vishvamitra is one of the Saptarshis and is often considered as the patron of Rama. Option C: ஆண்டாள் (Andal) - This is a suitable name to replace the <MASK> because Andal is one of the 12 Alwars (saints in Vaishnavism), and it would fit the context since other Alwars and Vaishnavite figures are mentioned in the sentence. Option D: இராமானுசரால் (By Ramanuja) - This word has a different meaning (by/through Ramanuja) and does not fit the context, as the sentence is apprehending the presence of individual shrines and not referring to the action done by Ramanuja. Based on the analysis, Option C: ஆண்டாள் (Andal) is the most logical and contextually appropriate word to replace the <MASK> token in the given statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Production capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong). What business development did the British use to establish a hold on the global cotton market?","completion":"The British used the improvement in technology, like the cotton gin, to establish a hold on the global cotton market.

Rising food prices, weather emergencies and political problems are deepening the struggle for families in many countries. Three UN agencies have published a report recently, saying high prices are likely to continue. Gregory Barrow, who is with the World Food Program in Rome, says, \\"If you look at the places where the World Food Program works, particularly in developing countries, you see people who might be spending more than 60 percent of their salary in purchasing food for their families.\\" East Africa is suffering its worst drought in years. In Kenya, at least three and a half million people are going hungry, mostly in the north. Yet food is going to waste in central Kenya. Now, farmers there want the government to buy their food and give it to those in need. Farmers say bad roads and lack of transportation make it difficult for them to get their produce to the market. Mr. Barrow says, \\"It needs the government to make some arrangements such as providing transport. They can buy it at a good price, then give it to those people instead of asking for food from overseas, which is very bad. When we are throwing away food, _ are asking for food from overseas.\\" Economists say that imports reduce local food prices, decrease productivity and increase the dependency on other countries. Farmers in Kenya hope the government can pay higher prices for their crops so that they can feed more Kenyans. Question: What is the best title for this passage? Answer: Options are: (i).

A:","completion":"Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur was a pioneering environmental toxicologist who studied the effects of the historic air inversion event known as the Donora Smog of 1948, which killed 20 people and adversely affected the health of thousands of others. The Donora Smog occurred in the mill town of Donora, Pennsylvania, from October 27th to October 31st, 1948. The disaster was a result of a weather phenomenon called temperature inversion, a situation where a layer of warm air traps cold air and pollutants beneath it, leading to poor air quality and reduced dispersion of pollutants. During this period, pollutants from local industries, including U.S. Steel's Donora Zinc Works and American Steel & Wire Company, were trapped close to the ground due to the temperature inversion. This created a dense smog over the town, causing visibility to decrease dramatically. The trapped pollutants consisted of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and metal dust, which had a severe impact on the health of the town's residents. Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur investigated this tragic event, focusing on understanding the effects of the toxic air pollution on human health. Through her research, she collected and analyzed data on the symptoms experienced by the affected individuals and linked the rise in respiratory and cardiovascular problems to the trapped pollutants. Amdur's study also helped identify the various components of the smog that were responsible for causing such detrimental health effects. The Donora Smog disaster led to increased awareness of the dangers of air pollution and was an impetus for the implementation of stronger environmental policies in the United States. Amdur's research significantly contributed to the foundation of modern environmental toxicology, and her work laid the groundwork for future environmental protection policies, ultimately culminating in the Clean Air Act of 1963 and its subsequent amendments. In summary, Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur studied the effects of the historic Donora Smog of 1948, a severe air inversion event that killed 20 people and impacted the health of thousands of residents. Her research played a crucial role in understanding the implications of air pollution and laid the groundwork for stronger environmental policies and regulations in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

James threw a shoe at the window and got it broken. The OPT: a). window is pretty hard.; b). shoe is pretty hard.;","completion":"James threw a shoe at the window and got it broken. The logical conclusion would be that either the window or the shoe was particularly hard, as different materials and constructions would result in varying levels of damage. Step 1: Analyze the available options. Option A suggests that the window is pretty hard. This implies that the window should not be easily broken, so if it was, the impact of the shoe must have been quite forceful. Option B suggests that the shoe is pretty hard. This implies that the shoe is made of a durable material or has a solid construction, which increases its likelihood of causing damage. Step 2: Consider additional factors. In cases where windows break due to impact, the force of the thrown object and the window's durability will play crucial roles. The same applies to the shoe's construction and materials used. It is important to note that even a not-so-hard shoe can break a fragile window if thrown with enough force, and vice versa. Step 3: Choose the most plausible option. Since the text already mentions that the window was broken, and we are considering the reasons, it would be more logical to mention the shoe's hardness. This would provide a possible explanation for the breakage. Step 4: Finalize the text. James threw a shoe at the window and got it broken. The shoe is pretty hard, which could be the reason for the damage inflicted on the window."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a text based on this summary: sunni group to boycott iraq elections Text:","completion":"Title: Sunni Group Announces Boycott of Upcoming Iraq Elections A prominent Sunni group in Iraq has declared its intention to boycott the scheduled national elections, casting a shadow over the democratic process in the country. The group has expressed concerns regarding the fairness and transparency of the electoral process, ultimately deciding that they will not participate in the approaching elections. The Sunni group's decision to withdraw from the election comes amidst growing political unrest and skepticism about the ability of the Iraq government to ensure fair representation for all. This boycott echoes similar actions taken by minority groups in Iraq's previous elections and serves as a reminder of the ongoing difficulties in achieving political unity in a nation with such diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds. The concerns raised by the group include apprehensions about the electoral system's potential vulnerability to manipulation and fraud, the lack of an independent monitoring body to oversee the electoral process, and the possibility of widespread voter intimidation. In response to the boycott announcement, the Iraqi government has called for national unity and urged the Sunni community to participate in the elections to guarantee their representation in the government. However, the Sunni group's reluctance to engage in the electoral process could result in a further marginalization of their community, deepening the existing religious and political division in the war-torn nation. As the elections draw closer, the international community is also monitoring the situation closely to ensure that the democratic process in Iraq progresses in a just and inclusive manner. It remains to be seen whether the Sunni group's boycott will ultimately lead to meaningful change in the nation's electoral processes and contribute to the long-term stability of Iraq, or if it will merely exacerbate the existing divisions and perpetuate the cycle of conflict and instability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - free flowing - translucent - sparse - slender - clear The answer is \\"sparse\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question is \\"sparse\\" because when an area is not thick with resources, it implies that the resources are thinly scattered or distributed over a large area, making them harder to find or collect in that particular region. Let's discuss the other options to better understand why they do not correctly answer the question: 1. Free flowing: This term refers to something that moves or circulates easily and smoothly, usually in reference to a liquid or a substance with fluid characteristics. Resources that are free flowing could be abundant or scarce, and therefore, this term does not specifically denote that the resources in an area are limited or thinly scattered. 2. Translucent: This term describes a material or substance that allows light to pass through it, but not clearly enough to see distinct shapes or images. Translucence is more a physical property of a material, rather than a descriptor of resource distribution or abundance. Therefore, it is not relevant to the question. 3. Slender: Slender generally means thin or narrow, often in reference to a person's body shape or to objects such as tools or devices. Though slender could be loosely related to the idea of resources being limited or thinly distributed, it is not the most specific or accurate term for describing the distribution of resources in this context. 4. Clear: Clear generally refers to either the absence of obstructions or the transparency of a medium. In the context of resources, \\"clear\\" might imply that they are easily accessible or visible, but it does not specifically describe the distribution or abundance of the resources in an area. In conclusion, \\"sparse\\" is the most accurate answer for describing a situation where resources are not thick or abundant in an area. A sparse distribution of resources indicates that they are spread thinly, making it more challenging to find or obtain these resources, as opposed to a region where resources are densely packed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: My old roommate’s cats, Clise and Monkey, were about as different as cats could be. Clise, rescued as an emaciated kitten from a local park, grew up to be morbidly obese. His interests mainly involved eating food, begging for food, or going around the neighborhood scrounging for food. He could hear a can opener from a mile away. Monkey was a more active cat. He liked to chase the laser pointer and was the first to run to the door when someone arrived. But he could also be lazy, lounging in a sunbeam or stretched out on the couch. Both of them liked to watch TV. Soon after I moved in, I started having health issues which necessitated a lot of time lounging around myself. This was the era of reality TV, back when much of it was actually good. The cats, Monkey especially, watched with me. Monkey definitely had his preferences. His favorite shows were The Girls Next Door and Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making The Team. Notice a theme here? Playboy Playmates and professional cheerleaders. Monkey liked his T & A (tits and ass). If one of these shows was on, and I turned it to Project Runway or something, Monkey would march off. But as soon as I turned it back, and he could hear the high-pitched giggling, he’d come running back. Clise’s favorite shows were Top Chef, Iron Chef, and Rachael Ray. Food porn. If there was something he especially craved, like a shrimp stir-fry, he’d assume a begging pose, right in front of the TV, as if Rachael might take pity on him and throw him a scrap or two.

While he works during the day on the construction of Waterloo Bridge his patient wife works during the night on a hotel telephone exchange. One morning on his way to work, Peter goes on the London Underground train and spots what seems to be a murder being committed on at the open window of a building overlooking the tracks. Deciding to investigate this \\"crime\\" Peter and a policeman arrive at the residence. There they find out that the couple were in fact rehearsing an illusion. Zoltini is a bad tempered magician and his wife Vivienne is his assistant. The suspicious magician becomes sure that his wife is having an affair with Peter - every time he sees her with the handsome stranger. On another night Zoltini and Vivienne have an argument on the backstage - leading to him slapping her in the face. As a result, Vivienne leaves (while her husband performs on stage) and takes a taxi with Peter up to his crane. Furious with Vivienne for leaving during the 'vanishing women' sequence of their performance, Zoltini looks for his wife while Pat has been sacked from the hotel for not paying attention to her job.

Continue the following story. Bill tired to light a candle during the wind storm, but the","completion":"relentless gusts of wind kept extinguishing the feeble flame each time. He knew he had little time left. As the storm roared outside the small wooden cabin, the shadows of trees danced menacingly on the walls. Bill struggled to maintain his composure, as the darkness in the room seemed to close in around him. Bill began to think of his family who lived a few miles down the hill. Desperation crept in as he realized how vital it was for him to light the candle and send a signal, a beacon of hope and safety to them. He fetched a cardboard box from the corner, hoping to create a barrier around the candle to protect the flame from the gale. Positioning the box carefully, he tried again to light the candle. This time, tiny hints of orange flickered to life on the wick, glowing defiantly even as the wind outside seemed eager to snuff them out. Bill carefully shielded the flame with his hand and watched as it slowly grew, casting a warm and welcoming glow across the dimly-lit room. A sigh of relief escaped him as he watched the flame finally hold its ground. Bill knew that he had to act swiftly, for his family's safety was on the line. In preparation, he had mounted a mirror near the window to reflect and amplify the light from the candle. He tilted the mirror so that it reflected the candlelight towards the hill where his family resided. Even before the storm had hit, they had planned this as an emergency communication method, should anything go wrong. Elsewhere, his family huddled together, shivering in fear as the storm battered their home. They heard the chilling howls of the wind, the rain pounding against their windows as if demanding to be let in. Their hearts heavy with worry and uncertainty, they looked up the hill anxiously, their eyes searching for any sign of hope. Suddenly, a faint glimmer of light appeared in the distance. As they stared intently at it, they could see that it fluctuated slightly, obviously fighting against the wind's persistent attempts to snuff it out. Hope blossomed in their hearts. It was Bill's signal. He was safe, and he must have found refuge in the cabin. Even though the storm raged on, the small but determined flame continued to flicker through the gloom, serving as a reassuring reminder that they were not alone in their fight. Filled with a renewed sense of determination, Bill's family took every measure they could to protect their home and endure the tempest together, knowing that they could lean on each other for strength in the face of danger. Outside the cabin, Bill continued to keep vigil, occasionally refreshing the melted candle to ensure the flame continued to burn. The storm showed no signs of relenting, and his family's safety was still uncertain, yet the simple act of keeping the candle lit helped forge an unbreakable bond among them all, an invisible link that assured them that they were enduring this ordeal as one. Hours passed, and finally, the storm seemed to diminish. The wind gradually lost its ferocity, and the perpetual downpour slowed to a gentle mist. As the daylight broke through the clouds, an indescribable sense of relief washed over Bill, and he knew they'd made it through the storm. When the skies cleared and the storm had completely passed, Bill ventured outside the cabin, his heart overflowing with gratitude that they had all survived. Through immense struggle, he'd helped to keep his family bound together through a tiny, flickering light—a beacon of hope amidst the darkness. United and resilient, they would now move forward, stronger than ever."},{"prompt":"Q: What is the only substance on earth that is stable in all three states?

Would \\"A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat , electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation .\\" be a reasonable answer? Available options: [a]. No; [b]. Yes;","completion":"[a]. No; A burn injury to the skin may vary in severity and can be categorized into three degrees based on the depth and extent of the damage caused: 1. First-degree burn: This type of burn affects only the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and causes redness, mild swelling, and pain. First-degree burns are usually managed with home care and do not require a visit to a burn center. 2. Second-degree burn: This type of burn affects the first two layers of the skin (epidermis and dermis). It causes a more intense reddening of the skin, along with blisters, severe pain, and edema (swelling). Some second-degree burns can be treated with home care, while others require medical attention. 3. Third-degree burn: This type of burn affects all the layers of the skin (epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue), resulting in a charring of the skin, which may appear white, leathery, or dark brown. Third-degree burns are the most severe and always require immediate medical attention. When a person experiences a severe burn, they should be taken to a specialized burn care facility, such as a burn center. Burn centers offer comprehensive and specialized care for individuals with extensive burns or burns that require specialized care, such as electrical burns, chemical burns, or burns that cover a large area of the body. In conclusion, the statement \\"A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation\\" does not provide enough information to determine whether an individual with a burn injury should go to a burn center.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less coal burned happens, how will it affect LESS electricity being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of less coal being burned will have a direct effect on the process of generating electricity in a coal-fired steam station. Since coal is the primary fuel source for heating the water and producing steam in this system, burning less coal will result in less heat generation. Consequently, this will produce less steam, which will then exert less force on the turning mechanism. With less force applied, the mechanism will generate less electricity. Therefore, the perturbation of burning less coal will directly lead to less electricity being produced in the coal-fired steam station."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Who gives Susan's brother a rock?

The fronds would have been lovely too, but their strikingly bold, rigid appearance didn't quite fit with the aesthetic she had in mind for her space. After making her decision, Anna carefully picked up the fern plant, ensuring that it wasn't damaged during transportation. As she carried the fern back to her house, she felt a sense of satisfaction knowing this was the perfect addition to her living area that would not only beautify her home, but also provide much-needed oxygen and tranquility. Upon arriving home, Anna placed the fern on her living room window sill, giving it ample access to natural sunlight. To ensure its survival and successful growth, Anna diligently researched how to properly take care of her new addition. She read about how ferns typically thrive in environments with consistent moisture and humidity, so she misted the plant daily and watered it as per the instructions she found online. To further invest in the care of her fern, Anna decided to buy a decorative plant pot to accentuate its beauty. She chose a stylish ceramic pot with intricate designs that she felt matched the visual appeal of the fern. Anna repotted the plant and placed it back in its original spot on the window sill. The intricate pot complemented the fern perfectly, and Anna couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride as she admired her handiwork. As the days went by, Anna became increasingly attached to her fern and made sure it was thriving under her care. She continued her daily routine of misting and watering the plant, and she diligently rotated it so that all the fronds received equal amounts of sunlight. One day, while observing the fern, Anna noticed that it had begun to grow small, vibrant green leaves. Excited and encouraged by the progress, she took this as a sign that her nurturing was paying off and decided to introduce more plants into her living space. Anna's collection included a variety of plant species, each with unique care requirements which she was eager to learn about. Over time, her once barren living area began to transform into a lush, vibrant, and rejuvenating indoor garden. The increased oxygen levels and natural aromas provided by her plants created a pleasantly refreshing atmosphere that friends and family noticed as soon as they stepped inside the house. People often commented on how happy and alive Anna's home now seemed, and these compliments motivated her to expand her indoor garden further. The process became therapeutic for Anna, as she found solace in caring for her plants and witnessing their growth. It challenged her in the best way, making her realize that with the right care and attention, she too could flourish, just like her beloved plants. Year after year, Anna's indoor garden continued to thrive. Her collection grew as she nurtured endangered plant species, rare herbs, and various exotic flowers. In many ways, the plants became an extension of her identity, reflecting her commitment to growth, transformation, and care. As she gazed out upon her ever-growing garden, Anna looked back at her decision to choose the fern over the frond and realized that this seemingly simple decision had led her down a life-changing path full of growth, self-realization, and an unending curiosity for nurturing the natural world around her."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? Answer: A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations. B. because President Moon wants him to. C. because he said he would. D. not enough information. Answer:","completion":"A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The M606 Motorway is a relatively short link motorway connecting the city of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, to the M62 Motorway. It is approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) in length and was officially opened for use in 1973. The purpose of the M606 is to provide a direct link from Bradford to the major motorway network of the United Kingdom, and in particular, to the M62, which runs from East to West across the country, connecting Liverpool on the west coast to Kingston upon Hull on the east, with Manchester and Leeds along the way, among other destinations. The M62 also forms a junction with the M1 motorway, a significant north-south artery, further enhancing the strategic importance of the M606 for Bradford's connectivity. The M606 also forms an integral part of the region's transportation infrastructure. Alongside its functional aspect of relieving local and through traffic pressure by removing the necessity of passing through residential areas or busy town centres, it helps support the economy of the region by enhancing its transport links, thereby fueling economic growth and development. In terms of its layout, starting from its southern end, the M606 leaves the M62 at Junction 26, which is also the location of a major inter-regional retail and leisure complex. It then runs northwards to terminate at a roundabout junction with the A6177 Bradford Ring Road, after having served junctions leading to various local destinations such as Staygate and Rooley Lane. Thus, the M606, while relatively short in length, plays an essential role in the region's road travel and transportation system by connecting Bradford directly to the M62, and thereby to the broader UK motorway network."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Global Positioning Systems are now a part of everyday driving in many countries.These satellitebased systems provide turnbyturn directions to help people get to where they want to go.However,they can also cause a lot of problems,send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost.Many times,the driver is to blame.Sometimes a GPS error is responsible.Most often,says Barry Brown,it is a combination of the two. Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm,Sweden.He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States.There he borrowed a GPSequipped car to use during his stay.Mr Brown says,\\"They just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination.And,then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived.They actually put their home address in.So again,the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\" Mr Brown says this is a common human error,but what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings,or failures,of GPS equipment.He says,\\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn.Because they just give you the next turn,sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\\" Mr Brown says,\\"One of the things that struck us,perhaps the most important thing was that you have to know what you're doing when you use a GPS.There are these new skills that people have developed.There are these new competencies that you need to have to be able to use a GPS because they sometimes go wrong.This goes against a common belief that GPS systems are for passive drivers who lack navigational skills.\\" Barry Brown says to make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers,passengers and GPS systems work together.

Sentence 1 states that the standards (likely referring to some set of regulations or guidelines) have been changed to require a certain type of description. It also mentions a condition involving fair value and reporting. Sentence 2 simplifies the concept by saying that the standards have been revised, according to the news. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between both sentences. Both sentences mention that the standards have been revised, which is a similar piece of information. However, Sentence 1 provides more details about the changes and conditions, while Sentence 2 is more general and mentions the news as the source of the information. Step 3: Determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. While both sentences have similarities, Sentence 2 does not include all the information provided in Sentence 1. It only contains the general idea of the standards being revised but leaves out the details about the description, fair value, and reporting. Additionally, Sentence 1 does not mention the news as a source. Conclusion: Sentence 2 is partially entailed by Sentence 1 because it conveys the same idea of the standards being revised.

[substeps] Though citrus trees may seem to have a lot of common, significant differences between breeds and varieties do exist. Learn how much water, sunlight, and fertilizer is required to support the citrus trees under your care. Can we infer the following? water sunlight and fertilizer are not required for the plants.","completion":"No, we cannot infer that water, sunlight, and fertilizer are not required for the plants. On the contrary, the information provided emphasizes the importance of knowing exactly how much water, sunlight, and fertilizer are needed to support the appropriate growth and development of the citrus trees under your care. To manage a citrus tree nursery, let's dive into a more detailed plan that will help you efficiently maintain and care for these trees: 1. Proper spacing and layout: Start by planning the layout of your nursery. Ensure the citrus trees have adequate space between them to allow room for growth, sufficient air circulation, and easy access for regular maintenance. It is essential to space the trees in a manner that will minimize the spread of any disease or pests. For example, typically, a distance of 4 to 6 meters (13 to 20 feet) between trees is recommended. 2. Soil preparation: Citrus trees need well-draining soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.0. Ensure the soil in your nursery is suitable for their growth or make necessary improvements (e.g., adding organic matter) before planting the trees. 3. Planting healthy trees: Obtain healthy and certified plants from reliable sources. Inspect the plants for any signs of disease or pests before introducing them to your nursery. 4. Irrigation: Different citrus tree varieties may have different water requirements, but generally, they all require a consistent and deep watering schedule to ensure strong root development and a healthy tree. Too little or too much water can affect the overall health and productivity of the tree, so it's crucial to provide the right amount. Typically, young trees require about 2-3 gallons of water per week, while mature trees need around 8-12 gallons. 5. Fertilization: Regular fertilization is essential for citrus tree growth and fruit production. A well-balanced fertilizer with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is recommended. The age, size, and variety of the tree, as well as local soil conditions, will determine the exact fertilizer requirements. Consult local agricultural authorities or experienced citrus growers for advice on fertilization in your specific area. 6. Pruning: Regular pruning helps maintain the overall shape and size of the tree, promotes air circulation, and encourages fruit production. Remove dead or diseased branches and any growth that obstructs access to sunlight. 7. Pest and disease management: Regularly inspect your citrus trees for signs of pests or diseases. Some common citrus pests include aphids, scale insects, and spider mites, while common diseases include citrus canker, greening, and root rot. Implement an integrated pest management strategy that combines cultural, biological, and chemical controls to prevent and manage pest infestations and diseases. 8. Monitoring the overall health of your citrus trees: Keep a close eye on your citrus trees so you can quickly address any early signs of stress, pests, or diseases. Regularly check leaves, fruits, and stems for indications of issues and take corrective action as necessary. In conclusion, managing a citrus tree nursery requires proper planning, knowledge of the specific needs of the citrus trees, and constant monitoring to ensure the trees remain healthy and productive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British. The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles. It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with Britain's partition of Ireland and domination of its history i.e. NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. The characters are portrayed as hapless fools, even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to keep the Catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism. Nineties' values about 'machismo', masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish 'psyche' which leads to violence.

Choose your answer from: [a]. summer end [b]. before thunderstorms [c]. The area was once underwater [d]. dry and hot [e]. It used to be covered by water [f]. never [g]. outer space [h]. under water Answer:","completion":"The appropriate way to choose the correct answer here is to analyze the hints provided by the teacher. The teacher mentions \\"cold fronts cause thunderstorms as they pass by\\" and \\"fog is common in the cold air ahead of the front\\". These hints give us a significant clue about when fog is common. If we break it down: - Cold fronts lead to thunderstorms when they pass by. - However, before the thunderstorm (which means, before the cold front has passed and while the cold air is still present), fog is common. Considering the options given: [a]. summer end - This is too general and doesn't relate directly to the hints. [b]. before thunderstorms - This directly aligns with the hints given. [c]. The area was once underwater - This doesn't correlate with the hints. [d]. dry and hot - This is the opposite of the conditions mentioned in the hints. [e].

Choose your answer from: 1. Chris is a senior citizen .. 2. Chris is a middle - aged .. 3. Chris is a young man .. 4. Chris is a kid ..","completion":"Based on the given information and context in which the conversation takes place, we can deduce that Chris is most likely a young man (option 3). Let's examine the different reasons that support this conclusion: 1. Vocabulary and slang: The use of the word \\"geezer\\" and phrases like \\"innit\\" suggest that Chris is familiar with modern slang, which is typically more common among younger people. This implies that he keeps up with contemporary culture and language. 2. Lively conversation: The fact that Chris was able to overhear your conversation and chime in casually suggests that he is sociable, confident, and energetic. These traits are more commonly associated with young people than with senior citizens, middle-aged, or kids. 3. Knowledge about the Hefner pad: Chris's awareness of the Hefner pad, along with its luxurious features like a Jacuzzi on the roof, suggests that he is relatively young and in touch with popular trends or tastes. The lifestyle associated with the Hefner pad appeals more to younger individuals who enjoy a more lavish and exciting way of life. 4. The nature of the invitation: The suggestion to move into the Hefner pad, even if just for a few days, seems to be the kind of offer that a young person would.make. It implies a spontaneous, carefree attitude that may be less plausible for a senior citizen, middle-aged person, or a kid. While it is entirely possible that Chris could be of a different age than what these observations suggest, the given context and information provide a stronger indication that Chris is a young man. Therefore, option 3 is the likely answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Its main character Julian, played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by Brosnan, is not your typical hero. Julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises. Having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely. And so, after a chance meeting at a bar with Danny (Greg Kinnear), he latches on and begins a halting, awkward friendship. Danny, the quintessential nice guy, is dealing with some stuff in his own life and, truth be told, could use a friend as well. The two make an unexpected connection, and Danny sticks around to hear Julian's story, even after learning the \\"unsavory\\" truth about Julian's work. Matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema, the anti-hero assassin (films like 'Assassins' and 'Grosse Pointe Blank' come to mind). But Matador differs in several key ways. First of all, the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail, meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you. And second, unlike most anti-hero films, Matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character. Julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing. This is unusual, given that 99.99% of us would consider killing for money horrific. And yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic. Although we don't like to admit it, almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough, maybe even murder. Did Julian's victims deserve to die? Who is paying to have people killed? Who knows. The movie never deals with these questions. The focus is on Julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship. If you read about someone like Julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer, but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity. Sympathy for the devil, I guess. Brosnan's take on Julian is well done and deeply unsettling. He doesn't completely divorce himself from his James Bond good looks and smooth charm, but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix. Weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance. It keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him. It's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays, but it works. The films only other major role, that of Danny, is not nearly as meaty. Kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular Joe with a regular Joe life and problems. The film doesn't really have any huge shocks or M Night Shyamalan twists, but I wasn't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying. It doesn't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human. And it didn't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet I thought the pacing was well done and I was never bored. Maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another, and how those needs have no moral prerequisites. Even a murderer needs friends, and even good people can be friends with bad people. It's a comment on the strange, random world we live in. A good film; worth seeing. Choose your answer.

Remove any obstacles or ground debris that may interfere with the proper use of a ladder. Move lawn furniture, potted plants, toys, sticks, and rocks away from where you're working.","completion":"After clearing obstacles and clutter, follow these steps for removing vinyl siding safely and effectively: 1. Gather necessary tools and materials: Before starting the removal process, ensure you have all the needed tools and materials. Common items include a ladder, safety goggles, gloves, a siding removal tool (also called a zip tool), a flat pry bar, a utility knife, and a measuring tape. 2. Prepare the work area: Set up your ladder securely and ensure it is level on the ground to prevent accidents. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for ladder use and safety. 3. Locate the starting point: To remove vinyl siding, it's best to start at the top and work your way down. Begin by removing any corner posts, trim, or J-channels that are attached to the siding you want to remove. 4. Use the siding removal tool: Slip the curved end of the siding removal tool (zip tool) under the bottom lip of the top piece of siding you want to remove. The curved end should hook onto the back lip of the siding underneath. Slide the tool horizontally along the entire length of the siding to release the lower piece from the upper one. 5. Lift and unhook the siding: Pull the bottom of the lifted siding away from the wall to unhook the nails or clips securing it. Be careful not to apply excessive force, as this may cause damage to the siding or underlayment. If any nails or clips remain attached to the siding after lifting, carefully pry them out using a flat pry bar. 6. Cut or pry off damaged siding: If you need to remove a damaged section of siding, use a utility knife to cut along the top and bottom lip of the damaged piece, being careful not to cut into the sheathing or framing beneath. If the siding is too damaged for cutting, gently pry the damaged section away from the wall using the flat pry bar. 7. Remove remaining siding: Repeat the process for each piece of siding, working your way down from the highest point to the lowest. Remove any remaining nails or clips using the flat pry bar as necessary. 8. Clean up:Once all the desired vinyl siding has been removed, clean your work area, disposing of any debris according to your local waste and recycling regulations. Store any reusable materials for future projects, such as replacing the removed siding or repairing other sections of your home. 9. Assess underlying materials: After removing the siding, inspect the underlying materials for any signs of damage, rot, or mold. Address any issues before installing new siding or finishing the area in another manner. 10. Plan for new siding or alternative exterior covering: If you plan to install new siding, consult with a professional or follow manufacturer instructions for proper installation. If changing to another kind of exterior covering, ensure the new material is compatible with your home's structure and climate. By following these steps, you'll be able to remove vinyl siding efficiently and safely, allowing you to proceed with any planned home improvements or repairs."},{"prompt":"Q:- You fill the tray with warm water - You carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degree Farhenheit, the freezing point of water - The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid - The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has greater volume as a solid - Because you used warm water, the gasses in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses - What might be the first step of the process?

In this sentence, \\"call\\" refers to a telephone connection, specifically the act of someone trying to establish communication with another person via the telephone.

They wanted to make sure their kids didn't experience loud sounds that might damage their hearing. In order to do this where would the family stand and observe? (A) In the front row of the crowd (B) in the back of the crowd Choose the answer between \\"Far from the fireworks\\" and \\"Close to the fireworks\\". The answer is:","completion":"Far from the fireworks. In order to ensure that Jim and Kelly's kids are not exposed to loud sounds that might damage their hearing during the fireworks show, the family should stand and observe at a location that is far from the fireworks. This would correspond to option (B) in the back of the crowd. When fireworks explode, they produce loud sounds due to the rapid release of energy in the form of light and sound. The intensity of the sound produced - which can easily exceed safe levels for children and adults alike - decreases as one gets farther from the source. Standing far from the fireworks, in the back of the crowd, would provide the following advantages: 1. Sound Intensity Reduction: As mentioned, the intensity of the sound decreases as the distance from the source increases, following the inverse square law. This means that by standing farther away from the fireworks, the family would be exposed to a less intense sound, reducing the risk of hearing damage. 2. Crowd Buffer: By standing in the back of the crowd, they would also be surrounded by other spectators who could help to absorb and dissipate some of the sound energy produced by the fireworks. 3. Reduced Risk of Debris and Injury: In addition to protecting their ears, standing farther away from the fireworks display could also reduce the family's risk of being hit by debris produced by exploded fireworks or accidents that may occur during the show. Overall, the family should choose to stand far from the fireworks, in the back of the crowd, to minimize the risk of hearing damage as well as other potential hazards related to the fireworks show."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes.","completion":"[A]. No. The given product review is definitely a negative one. Let's break down the reasons why it is a negative review: 1. Title – \\"Idem is JUNK!! Did Not Last Three MONTHS!\\": The use of the word \\"JUNK\\" in all capital letters along with the exclamation marks is a clear indication of the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product. Additionally, making a point that the product didn't last for even three months further indicates their disappointment. 2. Review content – \\"The watch quit working after less than 90 Days.\\": The reviewer explicitly states that the watch stopped functioning in less than 90 days, which would understandably lead to a negative experience. A product, especially a watch, is expected to last longer than that, and not doing so reflects negatively on its quality and durability. 3. Review content – \\"Been buying on the internet a long time and this is the most expensive peace of Junk I have ever bought.\\": In this sentence, the reviewer shares their experience of buying products online, mentioning that this purchase turned out to be the most expensive \\"piece of junk\\" they have encountered. The use of \\"most expensive\\" suggests that the watch might have been costly, and yet it did not live up to its price in terms of quality and performance. This amplifies the negative sentiment expressed in the review.

Mary had been there during Katrina's darkest moments and celebrated her joyous ones as well. Similarly, Katrina had always stood by Mary's side, providing unwavering love and support. When Mary started dating her soon-to-be husband, Jack, Katrina was the first person she shared the news with. Their conversations often ran long into the night, dreamily discussing what the wedding might look like and the roles they would play in the big event. As the years went by and their dreams neared reality, Mary and Jack's love blossomed, and he eventually proposed to her on a quiet sandy beach under a star-lit sky. With tears in her eyes, she called Katrina right away, eager to share the exciting news. Jumping at the opportunity, Katrina wasted no time in agreeing to be her dear cousin's flower girl. As the wedding preparations were underway, Mary and Katrina spent countless hours discussing the tiniest details of the big day, from the choice of flowers to the overall theme. Eventually, they settled on a soft, pastel aesthetic with dashes of romantic florals to complement their vision of a garden-inspired wedding. The excitement only grew when it was time to go shopping for the flower girl dress. Katrina's eyes twinkled with joy as she tried on various lovely dresses, her excitement for her important role evident in her every twirl and grin.

In the late afternoon, as soft sunlight filtered through the swaying trees and illuminated the scene, the first guests began to take their seats. The air was filled with warmth, love, and anticipation. Katrina, now dressed in a charming pastel dress with tiny flowers sewn carefully onto its lace, stood nervously at the end of the aisle. She clutched a small basket filled with rose petals, her hands trembling just slightly. Mary, radiant in her white gown, looked to her with a reassuring smile, conveying all the love and gratitude she felt for her dear cousin on this momentous day. As the music started, Katrina took a deep breath and began to walk down the aisle, carefully scattering rose petals at her feet. Her cheeks flushed as she stole a glance at the enchanted faces beaming at her from both sides of the aisle. As she reached the altar, she took her place next to Mary and stood proudly, feeling honored to partake in this special moment. Jack looked at his bride-to-be with immense love, and as the ceremony progressed, the bond between Mary, Jack, and Katrina seemed to be infused with even more warmth and depth. That day, not only did Mary and Jack promise to love and cherish each other for the rest of their lives, but they also acknowledged and celebrated the incredible bond that existed between Mary and Katrina, two souls forever intertwined by love and family. And from that day on, as they each embarked on new chapters in their lives, Mary, Jack, and Katrina continued to be a source of unending love, support, and inspiration for each other.

After Reese is executed, Hobbes and his partner Jonesy investigate a string of murders by an apparent copycat killer. Hobbes, through hints given initially by Reese, and later by the apparent copycat killer, tracks down a woman named Gretta Milano, the daughter of a former detective.

Sykes Answer:","completion":"Title: The Fall of Sykes Step 1: Establishing the Setting The movie is set in a small, tight-knit town where everybody knows each other. The people are generally good-natured, except for one notorious individual named Sykes, who has a long history of causing trouble due to his violent tendency and conniving attitude. However, he has never been caught and has managed to continue his pursuits under the radar. Step 2: Introducing the Protagonists Jenny is a young, ambitious police officer recently transferred to the town. She becomes aware of the situation with Sykes and is determined to bring him to justice. Her partner, Alex, is a seasoned officer who grew up in the town and knows Sykes' past, which motivates him to support Jenny's mission in taking Sykes down. Step 3: Building the Conflict One day, the town's annual festival is disrupted by an explosion that destroys a significant part of the festivities and causes numerous injuries. The townspeople are devastated, and the police begin an immediate investigation into the cause of the destruction. Step 4: Deepening the Plot Jenny and Alex gather evidence and start interviewing witnesses. Many eyewitnesses report seeing Sykes at the scene moments before the explosion, further deepening their suspicion. However, they also come across contradictory pieces of evidence that point towards different potential suspects, leaving them uncertain about Sykes' involvement. Step 5: Introducing Additional Characters While investigating, Jenny and Alex meet Mary, a seemingly innocent woman in town who also seems to be connected to the destruction. As they dig further into her background, they discover a connection between Mary and Sykes, which further complicates the case. Step 6: Climax Jenny and Alex continue their investigation, leading them to a final showdown with Sykes and Mary. In a tense confrontation, they reveal the truth behind the destruction, and it turns out that Mary was the one responsible. She framed Sykes to exact revenge on him for his past wrongdoings against her and her family while simultaneously using him as a scapegoat for the destruction she caused. Step 7: Resolution With the truth revealed, Sykes is cleared of the charges, although his reputation remains tainted. Mary is arrested for the crime, and the town begins rebuilding and healing. Jenny and Alex, having successfully resolved the case, now have an even stronger bond as they continue to work together to keep their town safe. In conclusion, when the police arrive, they initially believe Sykes was responsible for the destruction due to his notorious past and multiple eyewitnesses.

Look, Zuck runs the world’s largest social network, so he can’t just issue a boilerplate PR press release for the hoi polloi, like the CEO of an oil company or auto manufacturer, and be done with it — he has to connect, to show the power of Facebook’s platform to allow people to share moments from their lives. That means charming anecdotes about his dog alongside announcements about new charity initiatives. The means s 360° video of his child’s first steps. The means bland platitudes about personal plans to read more books or run a mile a day. That means warm, inviting photography. And it means a team of at least a dozen people helping run his Facebook page. As Bloomberg reports, Zuck doesn’t do this on his own. He has a whole team of at least 12 people who help write his posts for him, shoot those beautiful candid photographs he posts — including Washington Post stringer Charles Ommanney — and moderate his comments to keep the incredibly racist and vile stuff off Zuck’s page. None of this should be any surprise. Most major social-media presences are managed by a team of people, and why should Zuck be any different? And Zuck seems to realize he still has some serious image rehab to do after years of being painted as a cold, socially awkward boy genius. As court documents show, Zuck unfiltered was an odd and aggressive creature (though, granted, he was much, much younger when typing those IMs than he is today — and God forbid we all be judged on what we type into ostensibly secret chat windows). And Jesse Eisenberg’s alternatively insecure and ruthless portrayal of Zuckerberg in 2010’s The Social Network probably did him no favors ether. So one of his Zuck’s strategic goals, both for himself and for Facebook, has to been to turn “Mark Zuckerberg, billionaire tech weirdo” into “Mark Zuckerberg, goofy nerd who cares about the world’s problem’s, especially yours.” This is especially true because, with Steve Jobs gone, there simply is no other tech company than Facebook that is so thoroughly seen through the lens of its CEO. A strange and creepy Zuck translates into a strange and creepy social network. A happy-go-lucky Zuck that goes on safaris, builds his own personal home-AI, and loves to play with his dog translates into a social network meant for moments from your personal life, both big and small. The latest manifestation of this? A series of posts from Texas, which Zuckerberg is posting as if it’s part of his 2017 promise to visit all 50 states of the United States this year. There’s Zuck in Dallas “for work” (i.e., testifying in a massive lawsuit case against Facebook subsidiary Oculus Rift), planting a community garden tree: There’s Zuck sitting down with normal, everyday folks. There’s Zuck taking part in a cultural tradition outside his own Northeastern upbringing: And there’s Zuck doing the classic factory tour, in case a data center for Facebook: Plenty of people have pointed out these posts — and Zuck’s overall plan to visit all 50 states in 2017 — feel an awful lot like what someone would do if they were getting ready to run for political office. And it was recently revealed Zuckerberg asked for — and got — permission to serve for two years in government without relinquishing control of Facebook. But maybe you don’t need to see political machinations at play here. Two years isn’t a long time to serve in government. At most Zuckerberg could serve one term in the House of Representatives if elected (or serve in an another position if appointed by a president, which seems unlikely under Trump). Maybe all these rodeos and community gardens and local diner sit-downs are just Zuckerberg and his team’s awkward attempt to make him seem like exactly what he is not — just another average Facebook user. ||||| \\"Fortune favors the bold.\\" - Virgil, Aeneid X.284 \\"All children are artists.

As much as anything, that image was of Jesse Eisenberg’s fictionalized performance as Zuckerberg in The Social Network: an intense, socially inept kid billionaire who always wore a hoodie, whether he was meeting with financiers or trying to screw a co-founder in court. Over the past couple of years, Zuckerberg has made a concerted effort to steer his image in a different direction. Near the end of 2014, he began holding Q&A sessions with groups of people wherever he was traveling around the world, fielding softballs ranging from lessons on startup-building to his favorite pizza toppings. Those town halls have evolved into near-daily posts on Zuckerberg’s own Facebook page, mixing news of company milestones with personal epiphanies, soft-focus photos from his life as a new dad, and responses to user comments. “What he’s learned over the last two years is that his image in the digital domain needs to be controlled,” says David Charron, who teaches entrepreneurship at the University of California at Berkeley. “And he’s simply growing up.” Meeting developers in Lagos. Source: Facebook Zuckerberg has help, lots of it. Typically, a handful of Facebook employees manage communications just for him, helping write his posts and speeches, while an additional dozen or so delete harassing comments and spam on his page, say two people familiar with the matter. Facebook also has professional photographers snap Zuckerberg, say, taking a run in Beijing or reading to his daughter. Among them is Charles Ommanney, known most recently for his work covering the refugee crisis for the Washington Post. Company spokeswoman Vanessa Chan says Facebook is an easy way for executives to connect with various audiences. While plenty of chief executive officers have image managers, the scale of this team is something different. So is its conflation of Zuckerberg’s personal image with that of his company, the diaper-changing photos next to the user growth stats. “I don’t know that there are a lot of other business leaders that would find the same level of comfort sharing their personal and business stuff in the way that he does,” says Fred Cook, director of the University of Southern California Center for Public Relations, who has worked with Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs. Looking for game at Lake Naivasha in Kenya. Souce: Facebook Facebook’s a little different in that respect. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has used her page to discuss workplace inequality and her husband’s sudden death. And within Facebook, it’s an article of faith that Zuckerberg’s image is pretty much synonymous with the company’s, employees say. If people think Zuckerberg is innovative and charming, so is Facebook. That may help explain the PR team’s more ambitious recent efforts to compare the CEO to Iron Man. Beijing Source: Facebook In December, Zuckerberg, his wife, his baby daughter, his parents, and his dog all appeared in a series of videos dramatizing his yearlong effort to create a smart-home device akin to Amazon.com’s Echo. Zuckerberg dubbed the project Jarvis, as in the AI butler that Robert Downey Jr. uses in the Marvel movies. The Facebook team shot one video from Zuckerberg’s POV, one from that of his wife, Priscilla Chan, and one from that of Jarvis, voiced by Morgan Freeman. There are some cringeworthy moments, including the one after Zuckerberg asks Jarvis to play a good Nickelback song, and Freeman’s voice says there aren’t any. Groans notwithstanding, the PR blitz seems to be working. Zuckerberg’s posts typically get at least a couple hundred thousand shares; the Jarvis video clocked more than a million. USC’s Cook says his 18-year-old son follows Zuckerberg and reported that “he seems like a regular guy.” “If an 18-year-old thinks he’s coming across in an authentic way, that’s really something,” says Cook. Leaving the Vatican. Source: Facebook Jarvis was Zuckerberg’s personal challenge for 2016. His stated goal this year is to travel to all 50 U.S. states and improve his understanding of their communities. (By contrast, in 2011 his goal was to eat meat only if he’d killed it himself.) The CEO is also spending more time meeting with diplomats and beginning to figure out how to invest 99 percent of his personal fortune—about 2 billion in cash and other assets, plus 52 billion in Facebook stock—in philanthropic causes. With all that in mind, it’s fair to wonder whether Zuckerberg wants to run for public office. He isn’t saying, but his online mix of serious business and dad jokes can’t help but feel a little political. For a point of comparison, check out Barack Obama’s social media accounts sometime. The bottom line: There are more than a dozen Facebook employees writing Mark Zuckerberg’s posts or scouring the comments for spammers and trolls. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has at least a dozen PR professionals managing his online image, it has been revealed.

Wash with a color-correcting, low-sulfate shampoo and conditioner. Apply a hair mask once a week to hydrate your strands. Shower every other day with lukewarm water.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Revamp Your Color with Balayage: The Guide to Perfecting Your Locks Introduction Balayage has become a popular hair color technique that allows you to achieve effortless, low-maintenance, and natural-looking highlights. This freehand painting method lightens the hair strands from the middle to the ends, resulting in a soft, sun-kissed appearance. However, it is essential to maintain and repeat the process to keep your hair looking vibrant and healthy. In this article, we will explain how to preserve your balayage color and how to integrate the right hair care practices into your routine. 1. Repeat Your Balayage Process Like any hair color process, balayage is not permanent. With time, your hair will start to lose its vibrancy and brightness. Factors such as frequent hair washing, exposure to the sun, and using heat-styling tools can fade the color. To maintain your radiant locks, it is essential to repeat your balayage process when necessary. Typically, it is recommended to revive your balayage every 3-4 months or when your hair needs a significant color boost. It is always good to check with your stylist for personalized recommendations depending on your hair type and needs. 2. Wash with a Color-Correcting, Low-Sulfate Shampoo and Conditioner Using the right shampoo and conditioner is vital to preserving the longevity of your balayage. Invest in a color-correcting, low-sulfate shampoo and conditioner designed to protect and enhance colored hair. These products contain less harsh chemicals and will not strip your hair of its natural oils, ensuring that your balayage stays fresh and vibrant for longer periods. Additionally, color-correcting shampoos help to combat any brassiness or unwanted yellow tones, ensuring a natural and soft transition from your roots to your lighter ends. 3. Apply a Hair Mask Once a Week Balayage can cause some stress on your hair, especially if you are going from a darker shade to a lighter one. To keep your hair hydrated and healthy, you should incorporate a nourishing hair mask into your hair care regimen. Apply a hydrating, color-safe hair mask once a week, focusing on your mid-lengths to ends. This will not only strengthen and protect your hair but also provide it with the necessary nutrients to prevent breakage and dullness. Hair masks not only enhance the longevity of your balayage but also give your hair a lustrous and healthy appearance. 4. Shower Every Other Day with Lukewarm Water Overwashing your hair can strip away its natural oils and lead to color fading. To make your balayage last longer, try to shower every other day, or even every three days if possible. This will help preserve your hair's natural oils and maintain the vibrancy of your balayage. When taking a shower, always use lukewarm water instead of hot water, as hot water can damage your hair and cause the color to fade rapidly. Lukewarm water helps to minimize color loss during washing while effectively cleaning your hair and scalp. Conclusion Balayage is an attractive and low-maintenance hair coloring technique that gives you a natural, sun-kissed finish.
