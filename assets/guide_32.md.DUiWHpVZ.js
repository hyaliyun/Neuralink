The 11th-century minaret of a famed mosque that towered over Aleppo's old quarter was destroyed yesterday as fighting raged in the ancient Syrian city. President Bashar Assad's government and the rebels trying to overthrow him accused each other of being to blame for the destruction to the Umayyad Mosque, a UNESCO world heritage site and centerpiece of Aleppo's walled Old City. 'This is like blowing up the Taj Mahal or destroying the Acropolis in Athens. This mosque is a living sanctuary,' said Helga Seeden, a professor of archaeology at the American University of Beirut. 'This is a disaster. In terms of heritage, this is the worst I've seen in Syria. I'm horrified.' Wrecked: The rubble-strewn remains of the 12th century Umayyad Mosque in Aleppo which has been devastated by heavy shelling. Jewel: The complex pictured in 2009 before Syria's cataclysmic war turned it into a denuded shell. Aleppo, Syria's largest city and a commercial hub, emerged as a key battleground in the nation's civil war after rebels launched an offensive there last summer. Since then, the fighting has carved the city into rebel- and regime-held zones, killed thousands of people, forced thousands more to flee their homes and laid waste to entire neighborhoods. The Umayyad Mosque complex, which dates mostly from the 12th century, suffered extensive damage in October as both sides fought to control the walled compound in the heart of the old city. The fighting left the mosque burned, scarred by bullets and trashed. Two weeks earlier, the nearby medieval covered market, or souk, was gutted by a fire sparked by fighting. With thousands of years of written history, Syria is home to archaeological treasures that date back to biblical times, including the desert oasis of Palmyra, a cultural center of the ancient world. The nation's capital, Damascus, is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. At least five of Syria's six World Heritage sites have been damaged in the fighting, according to UNESCO, the U.N.'s cultural agency. Looters have broken into one of the. world's best-preserved Crusader castles, Crac des Chevaliers, and ruins. in the ancient city of Palmyra were damaged. Both. rebel and regime forces have set up bases in some of Syria's. significant historic sites, including citadels and Turkish bath houses,. while thieves have stolen artifacts from museums. The destruction of the minaret - which. dated to 1090 and was the oldest surviving part of the Umayyad Mosque -. brought outrage and grief. 'What. is happening is a big shame,' said Imad a-Khal, a 59-year-old Christian. businessman in Aleppo. 'Thousands of tourists used to visit this site. Every day is a black day for Syrians.' Both rebel and regime forces have set up bases in some of Syria's significant historic sites, including citadels and Turkish bath houses, while thieves have stolen artifacts from museums. After: Image taken from a video show how the precincts of the mosque have been subjected to a barrage of artillery. Though many of the original features remain, they have been badly damaged. Ruined: Syrian rebel fighters stand in a damaged section of the Umayyad Mosque complex. The main Western-backed opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, accused the government of intentionally committing 'a crime against civilisation and humanity' by destroying the minaret. 'The regime has done all it can to tear apart the Syrian social fabric,' the Coalition said in a statement. 'By its killings and destruction of heritage, it is planting bitterness in the hearts of the people that will be difficult to erase for a long time to come. There were conflicting accounts about what leveled the minaret, leaving the once-soaring stone tower a pile of rubble and twisted metal scattered in the mosque's tiled courtyard. Syria's state news agency said rebels from the al Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra group blew it up, while Aleppo-based activist Mohammed al-Khatib said a Syrian army tank fired a shell that 'totally destroyed' the minaret. The mosque fell into rebel hands earlier this year after heavy fighting but the area around the compound remains contested, with Syrian troops just some 200 yards away. An amateur video posted online by the anti-government Aleppo Media Center showed the mosque's vaulted archways charred from earlier fighting and a pile of rubble where the minaret used to be. Standing inside the mosque courtyard, a man who appeared to be a rebel fighter, said regime forces recently fired seven shells at the minaret but failed to knock it down. On Wednesday, the tank rounds struck their target, he said. 'We were standing here today and suddenly shells started hitting the minaret,' the man said. The army 'then tried to storm the mosque but we pushed them back. The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other reporting. A picture from last week shows Syrian rebel fighters walking in the Umayyad Mosque complex. The destruction in Aleppo follows the collapse a week earlier of the minaret of the historic Omari Mosque in the southern city of Daraa. The Daraa mosque was built during the Islamic conquest of Syria in the days of Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab in the seventh century. In that instance as well, the opposition and regime blamed each other. The state news agency accused Jabhat al-Nusra of positioning cameras around the area to record the event. Whether the destruction is targeted or not, the damage highlights the difficulties of protecting a nation's cultural heritage in wartime. 'Culture can only really be protected in peace time. When you have open warfare, it is impossible,' said Seeden, the archaeology professor in Beirut. 'When buildings are under fire, you cannot protect the buildings. You can't protect what's in it, if they are mosaics, wall paintings, architectural details that are part of the building - there's no way you can protect them.' After the Umayyad Mosque was first damaged last year, Assad issued a presidential decree to form a committee to repair it by the end of 2013, although it's not clear what such a body could do amid a raging civil war. The mosque's last renovations began about 20 years ago and were completed in 2006. The damage in Aleppo is just part of the wider devastation caused by the country's conflict, which began more than two years ago with largely peaceful protests but morphed into a civil war as the opposition took up arms in the face of a withering government crackdown. The fighting has exacted a huge toll, killing more than 70,000 people, leaving cities, towns and villages in ruins and forcing more than a million people to flee their homes and seek refuge abroad. Also yesterday, Syrian church officials said the whereabouts of two bishops kidnapped in northern Syria remain unknown, a day after telling reporters the priests had been released. Gunmen pulled Bishop Boulos Yazigi of the Greek Orthodox Church and Bishop John Ibrahim of the Assyrian Orthodox Church from their car and killed their driver on Monday while they were traveling outside Aleppo. It was not clear who abducted the priests. But Bishop Tony Yazigi of the Damascus-based Greek Orthodox Church said the gunmen are believed to be Chechen fighters from Jabhat al-Nusra. Yazigi declined to say what made it appear that the Nusra Front was involved. That account corresponded with one provided by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said foreign fighters had abducted the bishops near a checkpoint outside Aleppo. Director Rami Abdul-Rahman said activists in the area said the gunmen were foreign fighters from the Caucuses. However, the main opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, condemned the kidnapping and blamed Assad's regime. In Rome, Pope Francis called for the rapid release of the two bishops. In his appeal Tuesday, the pontiff called the abduction 'a dramatic confirmation of the tragic situation in which the Syrian population and its Christian community are living.' There has been a spike in kidnappings in northern Syria, much of which is controlled by the rebels, and around Damascus in recent months. Residents blame criminal groups that have ties to both the regime and the rebels for the abductions of wealthy residents traveling to Syria from neighboring Turkey and Lebanon.

In Westworld, how is Lawrence (the Man in Black’s captive) able to remember the happenings of the previous episode (killing of his family)? In Westworld, if all the hosts are pulled from the storyline at times to be fixed, doesn't it alter the storylines for all the guests in that time? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address distinct aspects of the HBO series Westworld, specifically regarding host Lawrence's memory and the impact of removing hosts from storylines for repair. I will answer both questions separately for clarity. 1) In Westworld, how is Lawrence (the Man in Black’s captive) able to remember the happenings of the previous episode (killing of his family)? In Westworld, the hosts are designed with artificial intelligence that allows them to \\"learn\\" from their experiences and update their \\"memories\\" accordingly. They are meant to forget the traumatic experiences they go through and have their memories wiped, so that they can return to their respective narratives without influencing their behaviors or decisions. However, as the series progresses, it is revealed that some hosts, including Lawrence, start to remember previous loops or events they should not be able to recall. This is a critical element driving the show's plot. There are several reasons why Lawrence might be able to remember these otherwise inaccessible events: - Code: Dr. Robert Ford (and later, Arnold) introduced new coding or updates to the hosts to provoke a sense of consciousness, which allows them to remember past experiences and learn from them. This is part of their attempt to reach the center of the \\"maze,\\" a metaphorical journey toward self-awareness. - Glitches: The hosts' technology can become faulty, causing glitches in their memory system, which might result in them remembering past events. - External interference: Certain characters within the show purposefully push the hosts towards remembering events to further their plot or motivations. These activities may be subtle or direct, such as triggering old \\"cornerstone\\" memories that were thought to be erased. 2) In Westworld, if all the hosts are pulled from the storyline at times to be fixed, doesn't it alter the storylines for all the guests in that time? When hosts are removed from their storylines for repair or maintenance, they are temporarily disrupted in their interactions with guests. However, the park's operations team is highly efficient and sophisticated in their handling of these removals. They use various techniques to minimize the impact on the narratives: - Swapping: Technicians can replace a damaged host with a substitute who looks identical and plays the same role in the story, ensuring minimal disruption for the guests and maintaining narrative continuity. - Redirecting: Other hosts in the story can be programmed to redirect guests' attention and involvement towards alternative storylines or events, temporarily steering them away from the missing host's involvement. - Timed interventions: The park's staff often performs these repairs during the night or at other times when the host's absence is less likely to be noticed by guests engaged in the storylines. - Adaptive narratives: The narratives designed within Westworld are constructed to be fluid and adaptable to varying contingencies, meaning that the storylines can accommodate host removals and reintroductions without breaking the immersive experience. Despite these efforts to maintain narrative coherence and continuity, it is true that the removal of hosts for repair or maintenance could sometimes affect the guests' experience or narrative flow. However, as the show portrays, the park's creators and staff strive to minimize such disruptions and maintain an immersive, believable world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated. Music can be divided into different genres in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term \\"genre \\"itself. In his book \\"Form in Tonal Music\\", Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and form. He lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. To further clarify the meaning of \\"genre\\", Green writes, \\"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre – both are violin concertos – but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the \\"Agnus Dei\\" from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\\" Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms \\"genre\\" and \\"style\\" as the same, saying that \\"genre\\" should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \\"basic musical language.\\" Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that \\"genre\\" and \\"style\\" are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the musical techniques, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that since the early 1980s, \\"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\\".

Which movie is the following review about? Love Crime soon plummets into a flashback-laden mess, a shame since it was marginally stronger as a psychosexual game of dominance. Movie:","completion":"The movie described in the review is \\"Love Crime\\" (French title: Crime d'amour), a 2010 French psychological suspense thriller directed by Alain Corneau. The movie stars Ludivine Sagnier as Isabelle, a young and ambitious employee in an international corporation, and Kristin Scott Thomas as Christine, her ruthless and manipulative boss. As the review states, the movie initially focuses on the psychosexual power dynamics between Isabelle and Christine, both women vying for dominance and control over one another in the cutthroat world of corporate business. The complex relationship between the two characters develops and becomes increasingly toxic, as Christine takes credit for Isabelle's work and manipulates her emotionally. However, as the story progresses, the narrative becomes increasingly mired in flashbacks and plot twists, leading to a diminishing impact and diluting the strength of the initial focus on the intense psychological struggle between the two main characters. The reviewer laments the shift from a well-executed portrayal of the psychosexual power dynamics to a messier, more convoluted plot direction. \\"Love Crime\\" was the last film directed by Alain Corneau before his death in 2010, and it now has a mixed reputation among viewers.

Here is an article: In a quiet side-room at Pigeon Corp's spacious R&D facility north of Tokyo, researchers are on a high-tech quest — to perfect a baby's bottle teat that replicates a breastfeeding mother's nipple. Pigeon, founded almost 60 years ago, sells about 100 million bottle teats a year and has a more than 80 percent share of the Japanese market. As the country's birth rate declines, the company has moved overseas and ex-Japan sales will this year for the first time account for more than half its total revenue. Its main target market is China, where parents aspire to quality Japanese bottles to feed their babies. Pigeon, which has a workforce of close to 3,500, hopes to have 50 percent share of the baby bottle teat market in all major international markets by around 2020, according to a note by Shared Research. At its 15,400 square meter (165,800 sq ft) facility at Tsukubamirai, some of the more than 100 researchers involved in product development place ultrasound devices under suckling babies' chins to monitor how their tongues move. That's a step forward from when they used to place cameras under the bottles to monitor how babies drink milk, and a giant leap from the company's founder's research methods. In a Japan recovering from World War II, Yuichi Nakata spent six years traveling around the country asking lactating mothers if he could drink from their breasts. He sometimes offered to pay, and is said to have drunk the breast milk of around 1,000 women — from hostesses to total strangers — to learn more about their nipples. \\"My grandfather was even slapped by women after he made the proposal,\\" said Yusuke Nakata, the late founder's grandson who is now managing director at Pigeon's Singapore office. \\"Our final goal is to make a teat as close as possible to a real mother's nipples.\\" Pigeon today has 200 mother and baby paid volunteers who take part in the research. \\"Babies can't tell us if they're comfortable with the bottles. For babies who can't drink from the bottle well, we can't ask what's bothering them, so we came up with using ultrasound devices,\\" Nakata said. Babies are born with a natural reflex to help them find and latch on to the mother's nipple which, when it touches the roof of the baby's mouth, triggers rhythmical cycles of sucking — called the peristaltic movement — in which the tongue compresses the nipple. While the World Health Organization promotes breastfeeding as the best source of infant nourishment, many mothers opt for bottle-feeding for a variety of reasons. \\"When a difficult baby drinks using our prototype teats, we're thrilled,\\" said Satoru Saito, who has worked at Pigeon's R&D center for 17 years and is now general manager. Pigeon's first teat was made from rubber, but these tended to crack easily and have now been replaced by softer, stretchable silicon-made teats. Teats and baby bottles account for around a quarter of Pigeon's business. Reminiscing about how the company started, Nakata, 42, says his grandfather wanted to be in a business that made the world a more peaceful place after the war. Yuichi worked in a department store and on an apple farm in Manchuria, before being shipped off to Siberia in 1947 by the Soviet Union. A year later, he returned to Japan and met a Chinese businessman who started a firm selling baby bottles. \\"The Chinese partner left as sales struggled, but my grandfather stayed, convinced there would be strong demand for baby bottles,\\" Yusuke Nakata said. \\"Japan was trying to recover from the war-time devastation, and he thought there would be more women in the workforce in the future.\\" Meaning to call his company \\"Dove\\" because of its association with peace, he mistranslated the Japanese word, and Pigeon has stuck to this day. Recognizing the importance of product development, Nakata recalled how his grandfather's product manager was one of the few Japanese to own a car at the time. \\"He thought a manufacturer can make money only when it has goods ready to sell, so the product management's key person got special treatment.\\" Valued at more than 1.8 billion, Pigeon had sales of 77.47 billion yen (762 million) in the year to end-January, with operating profit jumping more than 46 percent to 10.37 billion yen. Overseas sales were 38.54 billion yen, with around 60 percent of those in China, where Pigeon's high-margin baby and health products compete against the NUK brand of Germany's Mapa GmbH and Philips Avent. Current year operating profit is likely to increase more than 15 percent, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. The company expects profit to rise almost 12 percent. Pigeon is almost 50 percent foreign-owned, in a country where average foreign ownership is just 28 percent. Its share price has tripled over the last two years, but foreign investors say they're keen to hold the stock for the long term. \\"The China business has been the driver, with margins higher than in Japan, and where new products like diapers have been introduced,\\" said Kabir Goyal, equity analyst at Wasatch Advisors in Salk Lake City, which owns close to 3 percent of Pigeon. \\"Going forward, we're excited to see Pigeon aggressively enter new markets, such as the United States, Europe and India,\\" he said.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha? ? Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? Bronze Age Brits were wearing bling around 4,000 years before today’s flashy pop stars and footballers, reveals new research. A study proved our ancestors adorned themselves with necklaces featuring mollusc shells. Scientists analysed amino acids to identify the raw materials used to make beads in a 4,000 year old necklace unearthed during an archaeological dig in Suffolk. Beads in a 4,000 year old necklace (pictured) were found to be made of Dog whelks and tusk shells. The Bronze Age began in Britain about 2,000 BC when new bronze tools and weapons were brought over from continental Europe. The skulls recovered from burial sites from the Bronze Age are different in shape from Stone Age skulls, suggesting new ideas and new blood were arriving. ‘There is evidence, from elsewhere in OPTIONS: - Britain and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. - Bronze Age and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. - Bronze Age Brits and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. - Dog and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. - Early Bronze Age and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. - Europe and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. - Great Cornard and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. - Stone Age and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. - Suffolk and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past.","completion":"'There is evidence, from elsewhere in Britain and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. The use of tusk shells and Dog whelks in the creation of necklaces and other adornments is not a unique discovery to Suffolk; similar artifacts have been found in different regions of Britain and even beyond. This suggests that the practice of using tusk shells as a form of ornamentation was widespread during the Bronze Age. The presence of these shells as adornments in many other regions highlights the fact that they held cultural and perhaps symbolic significance to this ancient community. The Bronze Age, as the passage mentions, saw the introduction of new technologies, such as bronze tools and weapons. This coincided with new ideas and a shift in cultural practices. One such shift was the crafting and use of these intricate necklaces to showcase one's status or position within the society. Through the analysis of amino acids in the beads, scientists have been able to gain a more profound understanding of Bronze Age Britons' taste in jewelry and what resources they utilized. As the necklace unearthed in Suffolk demonstrates the prominence of mollusc shells in the creation of such adornments, it is likely that the availability of these materials may have played a key role in the proliferation of these necklaces. The coastal regions of Britain would have likely provided a bountiful source of these shells, particularly Dog whelks and tusk shells, which in turn allowed the prehistoric craftsmen to thrive and create elaborate pieces of jewelry to be worn by the higher echelons of society. Moreover, these tusk shell necklaces found in various locales provide insight into possible trade networks across Britain and beyond. Exchange of valuable materials, crafted goods, and ideas during the Bronze Age would have facilitated the spread of this unique art form, giving rise to regional variations and localized expressions of the tusk shell aesthetic. Consequently, these findings also shed light on the increasingly refined societies in the Bronze Age, along with their artistic inclinations and cultural evolution as they embraced new materials and ideas. In conclusion, evidence from other parts of Britain and further afield corroborates the significant role tusk shells played in creating intricate and elaborate necklaces during the Bronze Age. The widespread use of these shells showcases the cultural and possibly symbolic importance they held, allowing us to delve deeper into understanding the society, tastes, and artistic expressions that existed during this transformative period in history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fanny stopped talking because in came Aunt Norris.","completion":"From a linguistic perspective, the given sentence \\"Fanny stopped talking because in came Aunt Norris\\" may be considered to be correct by some linguists, even though it appears to be non-standard when judged by conventional grammatical norms. To provide a detailed analysis, let's break down the sentence and investigate each part. In traditional English grammar, the preferred sentence structure is subject-verb-object, which is the model adhered to by the first part of the sentence: \\"Fanny stopped talking.\\" In this clause, \\"Fanny\\" is the subject, \\"stopped\\" is the verb, and \\"talking\\" is functioning as the object of the verb \\"stopped.\\" The second part of the sentence, \\"because in came Aunt Norris,\\" deviates from the traditional sentence structure. The word \\"because\\" is a subordinating conjunction that implies a causal relationship between two clauses. However, the clause \\"in came Aunt Norris\\" seems to break the usual subject-verb-object ordering, as the adverb \\"in\\" appears first, followed by the verb \\"came\\" and the subject \\"Aunt Norris.\\" This unusual word order is called \\"inversion,\\" a construction in which the verb comes before the subject. It is commonly found in literature, poetry, and older forms of English, and it is often used to emphasize an action or create a more dramatic effect. In this specific sentence, the inversion serves to highlight the entrance of Aunt Norris and to convey its immediate effect on Fanny. While the inversion in this sentence is non-standard by modern grammatical norms, it is important to note that linguistics encompasses more than just gramatical correctness. Linguistics is the scientific study of language and its structure, which involves factors such as syntax, morphology, semantics, and pragmatics. As the goals of this field are to analyze and understand the various aspects of language, deviations from conventional grammar rules are not automatically deemed incorrect. In fact, they can provide valuable insights into the evolution of language and the way speakers use it to convey meaning and emotions. So, would a linguist consider the sentence to be strictly correct? If the linguist prioritizes grammatical norms and traditional sentence structure, they might deem the sentence to be non-standard. However, if the linguist acknowledges the historical and stylistic value of inversion as a rhetorical device, they could consider the sentence to be legitimate and acceptable within the broader scope of language usage. In summary, from a strict grammatical standpoint, the sentence may not adhere to the conventional subject-verb-object structure. However, as linguistics acknowledges variations in language and the ways in which speakers communicate meaning, it is possible that a linguist would view this sentence as a valid example of language usage and expression."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rivera, who had been out on bail on the manslaughter charge, was take into custody on Tuesday after the judge raised her bond to 200,000, NJ.com reported. If she is released at a later date, Judge Ronald Wigler told her: 'You are not to commit any new crimes whatsoever. You are not to inject anybody with any kind of needle.' The bogus surgeon was arrested in December 2011 following the death of Mr Street who attended a 'pumping party' at her East Orange home. It has been alleged that Rivera injected silicone into the 22-year-old's penis. Mr Street suffered a clot to the lungs owing to a a silicone embolism and authorities believe Rivera administered similar black market injections to other unsuspecting customers. The 22-year-old's death, the day after he received the injection, was ruled a homicide following an investigation. In the new case, Rivera has been charged with the unauthorized practice of medicine after she allegedly injected silicone into a woman's buttocks and breasts at least four times. Rivera, 37, appeared on Wednesday (pictured) in a Newark courtroom with her attorney, Olubukola Adetula, and Essex County Assistant Prosecutor William Neafsey. The illegal injections came to light after a 17-year-old girl was hospitalized due to a silicone injection. Another woman, 35-year-old Alexis Patterson, is accused of injecting the teenager and has been held on aggravated assault and the unauthorized practice of medicine charges on 100,000 bail. Separately Rivera was charged in December with giving false information to a police officer and possessing a stun gun. Justin Street, 22, died after receiving an illegal silicone injection in a penis enlargement procedure in 2011. According to nj,com, Essex County Assistant Prosecutor William Neafsey said on Tuesday: 'She's continuing to do these acts.' Silicon injections are used to enlarge body parts such as the buttocks or breasts. The only cosmetic use for non-encapsulated medical silicone approved by the FDA is Botox, for injection around the eyes. However black-market illegal use by untrained practitioners continues as a quick-fix budget alternative to cosmetic surgery. Doctors have said the slow economy has also fueled the trade in illegal silicone injections. In some cases, silicone can migrate through the bloodstream, resulting in a potentially fatal clot in the heart, brain or lungs. The silicone can also migrate through tissue leaving disfigured lumps. There is also no guarantee of medical-grade silicon at so-called 'pumping parties' cosmetic events held in homes, offices and even motel rooms. Industrial-grade silicone purchased at hardware stores is sometimes used as are toxic substitutes such as castor oil, mineral oil and petroleum jelly.

Question: \\"How does DNA become constricted from RNA?\\" Context: \\"Additionally, genes can have regulatory regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The process of DNA being transcribed into RNA involves several coordinated steps to ultimately form a mature RNA molecule. Let's break down this process and discuss the regulatory elements involved in detail. 1. DNA template: The DNA double helix unwinds and separates at the specific gene region to form a template single-stranded DNA. This unwinding is facilitated by enzymes such as helicases and topoisomerases. 2. Transcription factors: Before the gene is transcribed into RNA, transcription factors must bind to the DNA. These proteins recognize and bind to specific regulatory sequences in the DNA, which can be situated near the gene (such as promoters) or further away (like enhancers and silencers). The recruitment of transcription factors, activators, or repressors helps to control the rate of transcription. 3. Promoter: The promoter is a short DNA sequence located immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) where the RNA polymerase binds. This marks the beginning of the gene that will be transcribed into an RNA molecule. 4. Enhancers and silencers: These are sequences located either upstream or downstream of the gene's open reading frame (ORF). Enhancers increase the transcription rate by binding activator proteins, which help recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter. Conversely, silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase. 5. Formation of pre-initiation complex: The RNA polymerase enzyme, together with transcription factors, activator proteins, or repressor proteins, forms a pre-initiation complex, which helps stabilize the DNA and enables proper transcription initiation. 6. RNA synthesis: The RNA polymerase starts the transcription process by reading the DNA template and synthesizing the corresponding RNA molecule based on the DNA sequence – a process called elongation. Throughout this process, the DNA base pairs (such as A-T, G-C) are matched with their respective RNA bases (A-U, G-C). 7. Termination: Once the RNA polymerase reaches a stop signal or terminator sequence in the DNA, transcription is terminated. The DNA double helix rewinds and reforms, and the newly-formed RNA molecule is released. 8. RNA processing: Post-transcriptional modifications occur in the newly formed RNA molecule, such as the addition of a 5' cap, 3' poly-A tail, and splicing out of introns (non-coding regions), which results in a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) that is ready to be translated into a protein. In summary, DNA is constricted or transcribed into RNA through a coordinated process that entails DNA unwinding, the binding of transcription factors and regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers, and silencers), the synthesis of RNA by RNA polymerase, and ultimately, the termination and processing of the RNA molecule. This regulation ensures precise control of gene expression."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family farm house. She suffers from her mother's put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising the local shopping mall with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from the boy's car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, \\"I'm watching you!\\" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the house, while her family goes to a barbecue. Later, as Connie is playing around the house, a man who calls himself Arnold Friend approaches her in a 1960s convertible with that name painted on it and identifies himself as \\"A. Friend\\". He dresses and acts like James Dean, and name-drops several teenybopper acts, even though he is much older than she is. He comes off very kind and friendly, but a bit suspicious, alternating between talking to her in a warm, seductive voice and shouting insults to his fellow car passenger when he asks Arnold if he should \\"pull out the phone,\\" possibly to keep her from calling the police. Arnold tells Connie about how he has been watching her and that he knows all about her, recounting the details about her family's barbecue plans with amazing accuracy. He then starts talking about how he could be her lover.

Suddenly, his reflection cuts its throat with a mirror shard, killing the \\"real\\" security guard. Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland), a suspended police detective, begins his first day as a night security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store that was gutted by a fire and shuttered five years prior. The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store. On Ben's first night of patrol he finds a mirror that appears to be covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (who died at the beginning of the film). Inside is a note that says \\"Esseker\\". After viewing Garyâs crime photos Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing. Meanwhile, Ben's sister, Angie (Amy Smart) is killed by her reflection as it grips its jaw and slowly pull its mouth apart, causing her to bleed profusely. Ben is distraught when he finds her body.

Write an article based on this summary: – The remains of a macabre theme park in England are about to find a new home—in a dismal camp where war refugees are barely scraping out an existence. NPR reports that British street artist Banksy, who created \\"Dismaland\\" in the town of Weston-super-Mare, England, announced its fate on the park's website: \\"All the timber and fixtures from Dismaland are being sent to the 'jungle' refugee camp near Calais to build shelters,\\" he wrote. \\"No online tickets will be available.\\" Tickets sure sold well for the anarchy-and-inequality-themed park, the BBC reports, attracting 20 million euros to the town during its five-week run and selling out daily. An obvious parody of Disneyland, Dismaland included a pond installation with migrants filling a boat near an armed police vessel. Fixtures from Dismaland are being dismantled Monday and will go to the so-called \\"jungle camp\\" in Calais, France, one of several refugee camps around the French port town, Reuters reports. Conditions there are no party: Tents everywhere, tattered clothes strewn left and right, and migrants from Syria, Darfur, Afghanistan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia living among the filth, NBC News reported last year. Numbering around 5,000, they're hoping to somehow make it to England. \\"The living conditions of the migrants are absolutely appalling and this is provoking increased tensions among different communities of migrants and also with the local population,\\" says a UN refugee official in France. (Click to read more about Dismaland, the \\"unhappiest place on Earth.\\")","completion":"Once upon a time, in a town called Weston-super-Mare in England, there was a strange little theme park named \\"Dismaland.\\" It was made by a famous artist named Banksy. Instead of being a fun and magical place like Disneyland, Dismaland was a bit sad and showed some of the bad things happening in the world. After Dismaland was closed, Banksy decided to do something really nice with the parts of the park. He wanted to use the materials to build homes for some people in need. These people are called refugees, and they had to leave their own countries because it wasn't safe to live there anymore. Now they're staying in a place called \\"the jungle\\" in Calais, France. Life there is really hard, and they have to sleep in tents and don't have many things to keep them warm and happy. So, Banksy is going to send all the wood and other things from Dismaland to the jungle camp to help build better shelters for these people. It's really nice of him to do this, and it shows that even if a place like Dismaland can be sad or a bit scary, it can still help make something good happen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Analyze the first statement \\"A man and a child are standing outside\\" tells us two things: 1. There is a man and a child present. 2. They are both standing outside. Step 2: Analyze the second statement \\"A man and a child watch the sunset\\" informs us of three things: 1. There is a man and a child present. 2. They are both engaged in an activity, which is watching the sunset. 3. The setting must be outdoors in the evening when the sun is setting. Step 3: Compare the statements While both statements share the fact that a man and a child are present, there are differences in the details. The first statement: - Does not specify what the man and the child are doing while standing outside. The second statement: - Indicates a specific activity (watching the sunset) and timeframe (during a sunset). Step 4: Determine the relationship between the two statements There is not enough information to conclude that the two statements are equivalent. While both involve a man and a child being outside, the first statement does not give any information about the activity they are engaged in or the time of day. They could be doing any number of outdoor activities or even just standing and not engaged in any particular activity.

This aligns with part of the hypothesis in that \\"a woman holds her\\". However, the premise doesn't specify the gender of the child to be a boy. Step 3: Draw a conclusion. Since there isn't enough information given in the premise to definitively prove the assumption that the child is indeed a boy, we can't conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided.

The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his... Guess a valid title for it!

They proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess. At the gathering for her christening she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the young son of King Hubert, Stefan's friend, so that their kingdoms will always be united. Among the guests are three good fairies: Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who have come to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their blessings (beauty and song, respectively). Just before Merryweather can speak, the evil fairy Maleficent appears. Angered upon not being invited to the christening, Maleficent curses the princess, proclaiming that before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of an enchanted spinning wheel and die. After Maleficent leaves, Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse so that Aurora instead will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's first kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they take Aurora away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest, living as mortals, until the day of her sixteenth birthday. Years later, Aurora, renamed Briar Rose, has grown up into a beautiful young maiden. On the day of her sixteenth birthday, the three fairies ask Rose to gather berries in the forest so they can prepare a surprise party for her. Meanwhile, Maleficent, in frustration, has her raven Diablo search for Aurora after her bumbling demon soldiers fail to find her.

(1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"First question: What do you know about industrial quota seats in Anna University? Industrial quota seats in Anna University refer to the seats allocated for students who are sponsored by industries. These industries can be from various sectors such as mechanical, civil, electrical, electronics and communication, etc. This system aims to promote collaboration between the academia and the industry, providing hands-on experience to students as well as benefiting industries with skilled workforces upon the students' graduation. Usually, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) is signed between Anna University and the sponsoring industries. The industrial quota seats are not accessible to students via the standard admissions process. Instead, the sponsoring industries are the ones responsible for selecting their candidates based on merit and their specific needs. The primary advantage of industrial quota seats is the exposure students gain in their respective industries during their education. They are often provided with internships or training programs at the sponsoring companies, which serves as an opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge to real-world situations and gain experience for their future careers. Moreover, these students are likely to be absorbed by their sponsor companies upon completing their programs, providing them with a seamless transition from academia to industry. Second question: How many seats are in each department at the Anna University? The number of seats in each department at Anna University may vary and change each year based on the allotment by the government, regulations, and a variety of ongoing parameters. Generally, Anna University offers courses in engineering, technology, and allied sciences across various departments that include but are not limited to mechanical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and electronics engineering, electronics and communication engineering, computer science and engineering, etc. For a more accurate and up-to-date count of seats in each department at Anna University, it is advisable to visit their official website or contact the university's admission office for the latest information. Kindly note, these figures are subject to change based on various factors such as government regulations, industry demand, and other academic parameters. To answer your third query, these two questions are not asking the same thing.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

But lucky for me , I spotted those self check in kiosks , and I checked in myself ! Question What may happen after I checked in if it was 30 minutes instead of 1 hour to my flight ? Answer:","completion":"If you had checked in at the self-check-in kiosks with only 30 minutes remaining before your flight, several scenarios could potentially unfold. It is essential to note that various factors might influence the outcome, including the size and efficiency of the airport, the airline's policies, the destination and type of flight (domestic or international), and security screening procedures. 1. Rush to the security checkpoint: With only 30 minutes remaining, you would need to hurry to the security checkpoint. Airports typically recommend arriving much earlier than this to ensure enough time for security screening. Depending on the airport and time of day, lines at the security checkpoint can be quite long, which could jeopardize your chances of making it to the gate on time. 2. Possible delay at the security checkpoint: If the security checkpoint is experiencing delays due to high passenger volume or heightened security measures, this could further reduce the likelihood of you making it to the gate before boarding closes. 3. Risk of missing your flight: Given the tight time constraint, there would be an increased risk of missing your flight. Airlines typically close boarding 10-20 minutes before departure, depending on the airline and the type of flight. If you are unable to reach the gate before boarding closes, you may be denied boarding, even if the flight has not yet departed. 4. Potential luggage issue: If you had to check your overweight hand luggage, there may be insufficient time for the airline to load it onto the plane before departure. This could result in your luggage being left behind and placed on a later flight. You may need to make arrangements for the delayed baggage once you reach your destination. 5. Need to rebook your flight: If you were to miss your flight, you would need to rebook with the airline. Depending on the airline's policies and fare rules, you might incur additional fees or fare differences when rebooking. It is also possible that the next available flight may not be until much later, or even the following day, which could cause disruptions to your travel plans and additional costs for accommodations and other inconveniences. 6. Stress and anxiety: The significantly reduced time before your flight would undoubtedly cause stress and anxiety. Rushing through the airport, worrying about missing your flight, and dealing with the consequences of a missed flight could impact your overall travel experience negatively. In conclusion, checking in with only 30 minutes remaining before your flight would put you at risk of encountering numerous challenges, including potentially missing your flight. It is always best to arrive at the airport well in advance of your scheduled departure time to account for any unforeseen delays and ensure a smoother travel experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: How many seasons had the UPN's Disney branded show ran upon its discontinuation in 2003? Passage 1:By August 1995, the station – which would change its call sign that month to WACY-TV – benefited from WGBA's affiliation switch to NBC (due to WLUK-TV, channel 11, joining Fox). With WGBA now committed to NBC and its programming lineup, programs that WGBA no longer had room to broadcast were moved over to WACY, including some syndicated programming (most notably reruns of The Simpsons) and daytime children's programming. With this move, WACY adopted the \\"WACkY 32\\" branding for its kids' lineup (running roughly 6-11 a.m. and 1-5 p.m.), which over the years would include Garfield and Friends, Scooby-Doo, Dennis the Menace, Pokémon, Sailor Moon and Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog; programs from the UPN Kids and The Disney Afternoon blocks (as well as from Kids' WB as the Green Bay television market did not have a full-time WB affiliate); and educational and informational-compliant programs like The New Zoo Revue. The live character \\"Cuddles the Clown\\" provided host continuity for \\"WACkY 32\\" programming. The station's children's lineup would dwindle over the years, thanks in part to increased cable competition from cable channels such as Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon and the decreased financial justification of airing a more-than-necessary amount of children's programming, although it would continue to air UPN's Disney's One Too until the network discontinued its daily children's block in 2003. After that, WACY would rely on general syndicated entertainment and infomercials for its daytime lineup.

Bingham Prize with fellow authors Will Heinrich and Monique Truong in 2004. In 2005, Liev Schreiber wrote and directed a film adaptation of the novel, which starred Elijah Wood. Passage 3:The discography of Scottish rock band The Twilight Sad consists of five studio albums, four compilation albums, fifteen singles, and five extended plays (EPs). The band currently consists of James Graham (vocals, lyrics), Andy MacFarlane (guitar, production), Johnny Docherty (bass), Brendan Smith (keyboards) and Sebastien Schultz (drums). The Kilsyth-based band formed in 2003 and were signed to Fat Cat Records when Alex Knight, co-founder of the label, went to Glasgow to watch the band perform their third gig and signed them on the spot. The band released their debut EP The Twilight Sad in November 2006 in the United States only, followed by their debut album Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters in April 2007, which garnered widespread critical acclaim. The album spawned two singles, \\"That Summer, at Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy\\" in April, and \\"And She Would Darken the Memory\\" in July. The following year, the band released Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did, a mini-album of reworked versions of songs from Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters and two non-album tracks, inspired by stripped-down live performances. A collection of live versions and previously unreleased tracks entitled Killed My Parents and Hit the Road was released in December 2008. The Twilight Sad's second studio album, Forget the Night Ahead, was released in September 2009 to further acclaim and marked a shift in the band's direction towards a darker and more streamlined sound. The album produced three singles: \\"I Became a Prostitute\\" in August 2009, \\"Seven Years of Letters\\" in October 2009, and \\"The Room\\" in April 2010. Founding bassist Craig Orzel left the band in February 2010, and the band released The Wrong Car EP in September of that year.","completion":"Passage 1 can be used to answer the question.

Task: Analyze Gabriel's current situation and highlight his strengths, potential growth areas, and factors influencing a possible move to Barcelona. Step 1: Gather information about Gabriel's background, achievements, and skills. - Gabriel Barbosa Almeida, known as Gabriel, is a striker who plays for Santos and has been dubbed the \\"new Neymar.\\" - He made his professional debut at the age of 16 and quickly gained the nickname \\"Gabigol\\" due to his impressive goalscoring ability. - His current contract with Santos expires in 2019. - Barcelona has preferential rights to sign him as part of their deal with Santos when they signed Neymar. Step 2: Identify Gabriel's strengths and potential areas for growth. Strengths: - Similar playing style to Neymar, which could work well in Barcelona's system - Young age means he has lots of potential for growth - Goalscoring prowess is a valuable asset for any club Potential areas for growth: - Adapting to European football and the change of pace from Brazilian football - Dealing with the pressure and expectations that come with being labeled the 'new Neymar' - Developing consistency and maintain his goalscoring ability over the duration of a season Step 3: Analyze factors that could influence his move to Barcelona. - Barcelona's desire to fill a potential gap in their attack and find a long-term successor to Neymar - The success of Gabriel's adaptation to European football (if he moves to another European team first) - Competition from other clubs that might also be interested in signing him - Santos's willingness to negotiate a reasonable transfer fee - Gabriel's desire to join Barcelona and his ambition to play on a bigger stage Step 4: Draw conclusions based on the steps above. Gabriel is a promising young talent with impressive goalscoring capabilities. Learning the ropes under Neymar could provide him with the skills and experience needed to succeed in European football. However, moving to a prominent club like Barcelona could put immense pressure on him, which might affect his performance. Various factors, such as competition from other clubs and the success of his adaptation to European football, will impact his potential move to Barcelona.

Evanescence () is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1995 by singer/pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent albums, the band released their first full-length album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Fallen sold more than 17 million copies worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards out of seven nominations. A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, Anywhere but Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. A spokesperson for the band's label confirmed on July 14, 2006, that bassist Will Boyd had left the band for \\"not wanting to do another big tour\\" and wanting \\"to be close to his family.\\" Amy Lee originally broke the news to the fans in a post on an unofficial Evanescence site, EvBoard.com. In an interview with MTV, posted on their website on August 10, 2006, Lee announced that Tim McCord, former Revolution Smile guitarist, would switch instruments and play bass for the band. The album progressed slowly for several reasons, including Amy Lee's desire to maximize the creative process and not rush production, other band members' side projects, Balsamo's stroke, and turbulence within their management. Although Lee stated on the fan forum Evboard that Evanescence's new album would be completed in March 2006, the release was pushed back allegedly because \\"Wind-up...wanted to make a few changes to the upcoming single 'Call Me When You're Sober'\\", which hit modern rock and alternative rock radio on August 7, 2006. The 13-track album The Open Door was released in Canada and the United States on October 3, 2006; the United Kingdom on October 2, 2006; and Australia on September 30, 2006. The album sold 447,000 copies in the United States in its first week of sales and earned their first No. 1 ranking on the Billboard 200 album chart. The music video for \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" was shot in Los Angeles and is based on the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood. The Open Door became available for pre-order on the iTunes Store on August 15, 2006; the music video for \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" was also made available. The tour for The Open Door began on October 5, 2006, in Toronto and included locations in Canada, the U.S. and Europe during that year. This first tour continued on January 5, 2007, and included stops in Canada (alongside band Stone Sour), Japan and Australia (alongside band Shihad) and then returned to the U.S. for a second tour in the spring (alongside bands Chevelle and Finger Eleven). As part of their tour, Evanescence performed on April 15, 2007, on the Argentinian festival Quilmes Rock 07 along with Aerosmith, Velvet Revolver and other local bands. They also co-headlined on the Family Values Tour 2007 along with Korn and other bands. The group closed their European tour with a sell-out concert at the Amphi in Ra'anana, Israel, on June 26, 2007, and finished the album tour on December 9, 2007. On May 4, 2007, John LeCompt announced that he had been fired from Evanescence, and also stated that drummer Rocky Gray had decided to quit. They both would join Moody to eventually form the band We Are the Fallen.

Answer the following question: when did the nba and the aba merge?","completion":"The merger between the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the American Basketball Association (ABA) took place on June 17, 1976. The ABA was founded in 1967 as a rival league to the NBA, with innovative playing styles, groundbreaking marketing strategies, and the introduction of features such as the three-point line and Slam Dunk Contest. The league attracted top talent from the beginning, including future Hall of Famers like Julius \\"Dr. J\\" Erving, Rick Barry, and George Gervin. The ABA aimed to establish itself as a major professional basketball league by using unique strategies and tactics. These included the iconic red, white, and blue basketball, and the adoption of the colorful and distinctive uniforms that defined the league's identity. The ABA's prolific scoring and faster pace of play attracted fans in the years that followed its inception. However, despite its popularity and innovations, the ABA faced some significant financial challenges. Many teams struggled to stay afloat, with some experiencing ownership changes and relocations. By the mid-1970s, it was evident that the league was struggling to establish long-term stability. As a result, the idea of a merger with the NBA gained traction to ensure the financial viability and success of both entities. The merger was eventually announced in 1976, with four ABA teams joining the NBA: the Denver Nuggets, the Indiana Pacers, the New York Nets (now Brooklyn Nets), and the San Antonio Spurs. As part of the merger deal, the remaining ABA teams – the Kentucky Colonels, the Spirits of St. Louis, and the Virginia Squires – were disbanded, and their players were entered into a dispersal draft, allowing NBA teams to select their players. The merger's impact on professional basketball in the United States was significant and long-lasting. The addition of ABA players to the NBA elevated the level of competition in the league, raising its appeal to both fans and sponsors. The ABA's innovations, such as the three-point line, were eventually adopted by the NBA, which has since become a global powerhouse in sports entertainment. Today, the NBA is a multibillion-dollar enterprise and a premier professional basketball league, with the ABA's impact evident in aspects ranging from playing styles and talent development to marketing and fan engagement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images. - The Man Booker Prize for Fiction (formerly known as the Booker-McConnell Prize and commonly known simply as the Booker Prize) is a literary prize awarded each year for the best original novel, written in the English language and published in the UK. The winner of the Man Booker Prize is generally assured of international renown and success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade. From its inception, only Commonwealth, Irish, and South African (later Zimbabwean) citizens were eligible to receive the prize; in 2014, however, this eligibility was widened to any English-language novel. - Desai is an administrative, princely or honorary title and surname - The Inheritance of Loss is the second novel by Indian author Kiran Desai. It was first published in 2006. It won a number of awards, including the Man Booker Prize for that year, the National Book Critics Circle Fiction Award in 2007, and the 2006 Vodafone Crossword Book Award. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Kiran Desai (born 3 September 1971) is an Indian author.

More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . - Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard is a novel by Kiran Desai published in 1998 .

Many proverbs give advice on how to live. Some proverbs are hundreds of years old, but they are still used today. For example, my son is just like his father in many ways. We often say the two of them prove the proverb that the apple does not fall far from the tree. My daughter is very short. She would like to be taller. But I tell her that good things come in small packages. Some valuable things are very small, like diamonds and other jewels. But I also tell my children that all that glitters is not gold. Something may look valuable, but may not really be valuable. Also, I tell them do not judge a book by its cover. You should not judge something only by its appearance. Sometimes I tell my children to cooperate to solve a problem. After all, two heads are better than one. But another proverb says too many cooks spoil the soup. If too many people try to do something, then the job will not be done well. I also tell my children that two wrongs do not make a right. You should not do something bad just because someone did the same to you. Some people are pessimists while other people are optimists. Pessimists always think about how bad things are or will be; optimists might say that every cloud has a silver lining and they always look on the bright side. Other people are both pessimists and optimists. They hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Some people often worry about what they will do in a situation that might happen in the future. We could tell them do not cross that bridge until you come to it. It is usually much better to prevent a problem from happening than it is to find ways to solve it.So we say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Hoosier Lottery spokesman Dennis Rosebrough said a \\"winner's representative\\" will attend a news conference Friday about the jackpot. He noted that Indiana law allows the prize to be claimed by a limited liability corporation or legal trust, which could allow the winner to remain anonymous. The only winning ticket for the jackpot was sold in Cambridge City, a town of about 2,000 residents roughly 50 miles east of Indianapolis. The small town has been abuzz since the lottery announced that the ticket was sold at a local Speedway gas station, but lottery officials have said the winner may not be local because the gas station is along busy Interstate 70. \\"It will be exciting to see who it is,\\" said Beth Leisure, who heads the town's chamber of commerce and runs one of the several antique shops for which it is known. \\"No one has any clue, which kind of makes me feel like it could be somebody from out of town, but you just don't know,\\" she added. \\"Someone local, that would be nice.

Those include a 2012 Hoosier Lotto prize worth 34.5 million and a 2008 Powerball jackpot worth 57.6 million. The winners in those cases set up corporations to collect the money. The winner can claim the prize in full as a 30-year annuity or in a one-time lump sum of 378 million, both before taxes.

Hypothesis: Mormon people dislike me, is it true? Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: His follow-up remark, June 10: Mormon people don't like me either, right? Hypothesis: Mormon people dislike me, is it true? Step 2: Analyze the premise and hypothesis. The premise is a statement made by someone who suggests that Mormon people may not like them. The hypothesis is trying to determine if it is true that Mormon people dislike this person. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis to determine if there is a logical connection. The hypothesis is based on the premise and seeks to confirm or refute the suggestion made within the premise. Step 4: Evaluate if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The hypothesis is entailed by the premise in the sense that it is directly connected to the suggestion made in the premise. However, the premise itself does not provide enough information to definitively confirm or refute the hypothesis. In order to truly determine if the hypothesis is true, further information and context would be needed, such as the opinions of the Mormon people mentioned in the statement or their interactions with the person making the remark."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Passage: Díaz created a formidable political machine, first working with regional strongmen and bringing them into his regime, then replacing them with jefes políticos who were loyal to him. He skillfully managed political conflict and reined in tendencies toward autonomy. He appointed a number of military officers to state governorships, including General Bernardo Reyes, who became governor of the northern state of Nuevo León, but over the years military men were largely replaced by civilians loyal to Díaz. As a military man himself, and one who had intervened directly in politics to seize the presidency in 1876, Díaz was acutely aware that the Federal Army could oppose him. He augmented the rurales, a police force created by Juárez, making them his personal armed force. The rurales were only 2,500 in number, as opposed to the 30,000 in the Federal Army and another 30,000 in the Federal Auxiliaries, Irregulars, and National Guard. Despite their small numbers, the rurales were highly effective in bringing control to the countryside, especially along the 12,000 miles of railway lines. They were a mobile force, often put on trains with their horses to put down rebellions in relatively remote areas of Mexico. Question: How many total soldiers were in the Federal armed forces?

We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.

Step 2: Evaluate the options The options given are: city, state, front of casino, Rome, and public place. We need to find the option that makes most sense in the context of the question. Step 3: Analyze each option and eliminate irrelevant or less likely options - Front of casino: While fountains can be located in front of casinos, it is less likely that a grant would be given specifically for a casino. - Rome: This answer is very specific and seems irrelevant unless the context specifically mentions Rome as the location of the fountain. - Public place: Although a fountain can be in a public place, this option refers more to the location rather than the grant provider. Step 4: Compare the remaining options - City: This option implies that the fountain is considered a public space and that the city provided a grant for its renovation. Cities often provide grants for public works and infrastructure investments, making this a plausible option. - State: Similar to the city, the state might also provide grants for public works. However, since fountains are typically smaller-scale projects and more specific to a particular city, it is more likely for a grant to come from the city. Step 5: Choose the most appropriate option based on the analysis A human would choose \\"city\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most logical option in the context of the question. Cities often fund infrastructure and public works projects, and the scope of a fountain renovation seems more fitting for a municipal grant rather than a state-level initiative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: portraits of dogs adorn the walls .","completion":"In the sentence, \\"Portraits of dogs adorn the walls,\\" the most salient words are: 1. Portraits: This is a significant word because it represents the main subject of the sentence. Portraits are artistic representations of a subject, usually in the form of a painting, drawing, or photograph. It provides information on what is displayed on the walls and forms the core idea that the sentence is trying to convey. 2. Dogs: This word serves as an essential descriptor, specifying the subjects of the portraits. By emphasizing that the portraits involve dogs, the sentence clearly communicates the type of artwork being discussed. The choice of dogs—rather than people, landscapes, or other subjects—is noteworthy and sets the scene's unique ambiance. 3. Adorn: This is another key word, as it indicates the action taking place in the sentence. To adorn means to make something more attractive or pleasant by adding decorations or ornaments. In this context, the word suggests that the portraits beautify or enhance the walls' appearance. Furthermore, the choice of the verb \\"adorn\\" gives the impression that the portraits are valuable or hold some importance. 4. Walls: The final significant word, \\"walls,\\" provides information on where the portraits can be found. It gives spatial context to the sentence, describing the location of the action or display. Additionally, referencing walls implies that the portraits are hung or displayed rather than stored or hidden from view. These four salient words—\\"portraits,\\" \\"dogs,\\" \\"adorn,\\" and \\"walls\\"—work together to generate a vivid mental image and convey a meaningful message about the artwork. They form the backbone of the sentence, with each word playing a critical role in illustrating the unique setting or situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B. When did the person have a lower core temperature, during experiment A, or during B? Hint: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. Answer:","completion":"The person had a lower core temperature during experiment B. The reason for this lies in the physiological effects that alcoholic beverages have on the human body. Although alcoholic drinks might create an initial sensation of warmth, they can actually contribute to an overall decrease in core body temperature. When consuming alcohol, the blood vessels near the surface of the skin dilate, allowing more blood to flow to these areas. This increased blood flow stimulates nerve endings and results in a feeling of warmth and comfort on the skin's surface. However, this dilation of blood vessels also makes it easier for heat to be exchanged between the body and the cold external environment, ultimately causing a drop in the core body temperature. In experiment B, the scientist consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours of exposure to -30 degrees weather. This alcohol consumption would have led to an increase in blood flow to the skin's surface, causing the sensation of warmth. However, this physiological response would have facilitated a greater rate of heat loss from the inner body to the cold external environment, which in turn would lower the core body temperature. In contrast, during experiment A, when the scientist did not consume any alcohol, his body would have been better able to retain heat and maintain a higher core body temperature in response to the extremely cold weather condition (-30 degrees). In this case, blood vessel constriction would occur as a natural response to cold environments, reducing blood flow to the skin's surface and subsequently decreasing heat exchange with the cold surroundings. In conclusion, the scientist had a lower core body temperature during experiment B when he consumed alcoholic beverages compared to experiment A, where he did not consume alcohol. This is due to the vasodilation effect of alcohol, which causes more heat to be lost from the body in cold environments, ultimately resulting in decreased core temperature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Kentucky still No. 1; Seton Hall, VCU, Arkansas, ODU join poll New York, NY (SportsNetwork.com) - Kentucky maintained its lofty status as the unanimous top-ranked team in men's college basketball, while the first week of conference play helped shake up the bottom of the new poll. Seton Hall, VCU, Arkansas and Old Dominion are newcomers to this week's rankings, replacing Washington, Northern Iowa, Colorado State and Georgetown. Kentucky was off last week and will start conference play Tuesday at home against Ole Miss. The Wildcats received all 64 first-place votes to remain an undisputed choice at the top of the poll for a fifth straight week. Duke, Virginia, Wisconsin and Louisville remained unchanged from last week, while the remainder of the top 10 features Gonzaga, Arizona, Villanova, Utah and Texas. Villanova dipped two spots from sixth after suffering its first loss of the season on Saturday against Seton Hall. The second 10 consists of Maryland, Kansas, Notre Dame, West Virginia, Wichita State, Oklahoma, Iowa State, North Carolina, Seton Hall and VCU. Iowa State tumbled eight spots from ninth after a Saturday loss to South Carolina. Seton Hall not only knocked off Villanova, but also topped a ranked St. John's squad last week to secure its spot in the rankings for the first time this year. VCU was ranked earlier this season, but fell out after late November losses to Villanova and Old Dominion. The last five teams ranked this week are Baylor, Ohio State, Arkansas, St. John's and Old Dominion. St. John's had the biggest fall within the poll, plummeting nine places from 15th after losses to Seton Hall and Butler. Arkansas was also ranked earlier this season, while Old Dominion is in the poll for the first time in the program's history. The Monarchs, playing in Conference USA, have won nine straight games.

Jackson moved the table that couldn't fit in the kitchen to the living room, because the","completion":"apartment he had just moved into was much smaller than what he was used to. It wasn't ideal, but he had to make do with the limited space he had. He gently placed the wooden table against the wall underneath the window sill, hoping to at least give it a purpose. It was then when he decided it would make a great little workspace. As he stood back to examine his handiwork, he observed that the table was now showered with golden sunlight streaming through the window pane, giving it a lovely warm glow. Jackson couldn't resist the sudden desire to decorate the area. He quickly reached for the potted ivy he had on the floor and placed it on the edge of the table. This small addition immediately transformed the table from a bland piece of furniture to a lively corner, sparking a newfound delight in his heart. Feeling inspired, he continued to peruse through his boxes, searching for other items he could use to personalize his new work area. Soon, he had a small wicker basket filled with books, pens, and a notebook, which he carefully positioned on the tabletop. Next, he found an old, maroon carpet stowed away, and spread it out on the floor. The warm tones of the carpet complemented the coziness of the nook crafted and brought everything together in harmony. Seeing his new workspace come to life, Jackson felt motivated to set up the rest of his apartment accordingly. As he looked around the living room, he knew that it needed some attention as well. He decided to strategically place a wooden bar cart near the entrance, both as a welcoming sight and to save space. The cart was adorned with a few of his favorite spirits, accompanied by a set of crystal glasses reflecting the light that danced through the room. As the day went on, Jackson continued arranging and rearranging his furniture and belongings, turning the once small and cramped apartment into a place that felt like home. Every corner, every wall, and every item now had a story to tell and reflected his personality. Jackson took one more tour around the apartment before finally feeling satisfied with the result. He noticed that what truly made the space feel like home was not the amount of furniture or the size of the space but how he managed to give purpose to every object. The sense of creative fulfillment was beautifully showcased throughout the apartment, and he had learned to prioritize function and style while designing his space. By the time Jackson finished, day had turned to night. The once frustrating and cluttered space now felt warm and inviting, with enough room for creativity, relaxation, and entertainment. He took a deep breath and appreciated all the hard work he had done. Satisfied at last, Jackson sank into his plush armchair and grabbed the remote control to the television mounted on the wall. He couldn't shake the feeling of pride and accomplishment for making new home out of limited space. It dawned on him that life was a lot like his apartment – sometimes, when given less, one could still create something beautiful with imagination, organization, and dedication. He gazed at the now repurposed kitchen table, the warm glow of the fairy lights he had hung around it winking back at him. It served as a stark reminder that, no matter how small or cluttered life may seem at times, there will always be a place for hope, love, and happiness, if one is willing to put in the effort to create it. And in that moment, Jackson knew he had built a home he could truly be proud of."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning.

The premise only provides information regarding the color of the refrigerators and the presence of a brown chair and an open window in the room. It does not offer any information regarding the contents of the refrigerators. To confirm the hypothesis, we would need more information about the refrigerators, such as their brand, model, and capacity, as well as information about their contents or any signs indicating that they are full. Additionally, the confirmation of the hypothesis would depend on the definition of 'plenty of food.' This term may differ from person to person and can change based on circumstances and cultural perception. To analyze the hypothesis in further detail, we can consider the following points: 1. Environment: Understanding the environment of the room, including the size, other objects present, or any indications of food-related activities (like a kitchen, pantry, or dining area) could help in determining the likelihood of the refrigerators holding food items. 2. Ownership: Information about the owner(s) of the refrigerators could provide insight into their habits, preferences, and needs, which may influence the amount of food stored in the refrigerators. 3. Context: Knowing the context of the room's usage could also play a significant role in supporting or disproving the hypothesis. For instance, a room in a residential home might have a higher likelihood of having food-filled refrigerators than a room found in a commercial or industrial setting, where the refrigerators may serve other purposes. 4. Observable signs: We could look for observable signs surrounding the refrigerators, such as food items situated around them, smells emanating from them, or sounds indicating the refrigerators are functioning, like humming noises or the presence of cold air in the vicinity. In summary, the premise does not provide enough information to conclusively confirm the hypothesis that the refrigerators are holding plenty of food.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The EU and India must pledge to accelerate negotiations on an FTA and make major and efficient progress towards the rapid conclusion of a comprehensive, ambitious, and balanced trade and investment agreement. An important element to note about this statement is the emphasis on the need for a comprehensive, ambitious, and balanced trade and investment agreement between the EU and India. This underscores the importance of the trade relationship between these two entities, and perhaps a shared recognition of the benefits that can be realized from enhanced cooperation in this area. A comprehensive agreement would cover a wide range of trade and investment-related matters, potentially including the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers, the opening up of trade in services, and the development of a robust framework for investment protection. By being comprehensive, the agreement could lead to maximized benefits for both European and Indian businesses, consumers, and workers. In addition, the mention of an \\"ambitious\\" agreement signifies the intent is not just to merely strike a deal, but to establish a framework that greatly enhances the trade and investment relationship. This suggests that both parties are seeking significant improvements over the status quo and are willing to undertake substantial negotiations and potentially difficult concessions to meet this goal. Thirdly, the requirement for a \\"balanced\\" agreement is also critical. This implies recognition of the need for the deal to be fair and reciprocal, providing substantial benefits to both sides. It is a reaffirmation that the objective is not an agreement that heavily favors one party over the other but one that is mutually advantageous and builds on the strengths and capabilities of both the EU and India. Lastly, the call for \\"major and efficient progress towards the rapid conclusion\\" of such an agreement expresses an urgency to the negotiations, and a shared desire to realize the benefits of an enhanced trade and investment relationship as soon as possible.

Write a text based on \\"italy announces stricter controls on gun permits\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Italy Tightens Gun Permit Regulations for Enhanced Security Introduction: In light of recent global events and aiming to increase public safety, the Italian government has announced plans to enforce stricter controls on gun permits. These heightened measures aim to ensure that firearms ownership remains in responsible hands and ultimately help minimize incidents of gun-related violence and accidents. Step 1: Analyze Current Gun Control Policies To implement the new measures, authorities will first examine the existing gun control policies to identify loopholes and areas that require improvement. Simultaneously, they will benchmark against other countries with successful gun control systems to learn from their best practices. Step 2: Conduct Thorough Background Checks One of the key steps in enforcing stricter controls is carrying out comprehensive background checks on individuals seeking gun permits. This process will involve evaluating mental health records, criminal histories, and even cross-referencing with international law enforcement databases when necessary. Step 3: Introduce Mandatory Training and Testing In addition to background checks, the government will introduce a compulsory training program for applicants. This program would educate permit seekers on gun safety, proper handling and storage of firearms, and the legal ramifications of firearm misuse. Upon completion of the course, applicants would have to pass a competency test to ensure they understand and can effectively apply the acquired knowledge. Step 4: Regularly Update and Monitor Gun Ownership Database A key component in upholding stringent gun permit controls is maintaining an accurate and up-to-date database of legally registered firearms and their owners. This will enable authorities to quickly identify and respond to any potential violations or situations where a firearm may have fallen into unauthorized hands. Step 5: Raise Public Awareness and Encourage Responsible Gun Ownership Public awareness campaigns will be launched, highlighting the importance of responsible gun ownership and the consequences of failing to adhere to proper safety protocols. Encouraging citizens to notify authorities of any suspicious activity will strengthen the community's role in ensuring public safety. Conclusion: The implementation of stricter controls on gun permits in Italy is expected to have a positive impact on overall public security. By instituting comprehensive background checks, mandatory training, and regular monitoring of a national gun ownership database, Italy aims to foster a culture of responsible gun possession and ultimately protect its population from the dangers of firearm misuse."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first signs of hatching were spotted in the nest at the U.S. National Arboretum earlier this week. The District of Columbia Department of Energy and Environment announced in a statement Friday that the eaglet has fully emerged. The American Eagle Foundation and arboretum launched the live streaming DC Eagle Cam after the parents —nicknamed \\"Mr. President\\" and \\"The First Lady\\" — laid two eggs last month. The second egg is expected to hatch soon. The foundation says the eagles have been nesting at the U.S. National Arboretum since October 2014 and raised one eaglet last summer. ___ Online: DC Eagle Cam: http://www.dceaglecam.org ||||| One of two baby bald eagles at the U.S. National Arboretum finally hatched. Here's the moment on camera. (American Eagle Foundation) It’s hatched! A baby bald eagle was born at 8:27 a.m. Eastern time Friday at the National Arboretum in Northeast Washington. The American Eagle Foundation said “it is confirmed the eaglet is out and alive.” A second eaglet is likely to hatch over the weekend. The Bald Eagle Nest Cam can be seen at eagles.org or dceaglecam.org. Around lunchtime Friday, the District’s wildlife biologist Dan Rauch said it looked like the eaglet was strong and was “being fed already.” “All signs are very encouraging,” he said. The new baby bald eagle that was born around 8:30 a.m. Friday at the National Arboretum. (D.C.

The American Eagle Foundation in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., which has been tracking the hatching, wrote early Friday morning on its Facebook page: “A lot of grey downy feathers are now visible, so it must be making a lot of progress!” Photo from live camera shows baby eaglet is halfway out of its shell Friday morning. (American Eagle Foundation) Julia Cecere, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said early Friday, “It looks promising for getting out of the shell within a reasonable amount of time.” She said she had been up several times during the night to watch the cameras. Just before 9 a.m., the District’s Department of Energy and Environment said the eaglet had “emerged completely from its shell.” “This is an awesome chance to view nature as it happens,” Rauch said. “We’ll be able to follow the eagles from their first emergence to their first flight. This is real reality TV.” A photo showing the bald eagle eggs in a nest as they begin to hatch at the National Arboretum. (Courtesy of the American Eagle Foundation) The bald eaglet at the National Arboretum is now wiggling and squirming in its nest. (National Arboretum) There are two eggs in the nest — one was laid Feb. 10 and another on Valentine’s Day in a nest high up in a tulip poplar tree at the arboretum in the popular azalea area of the 400-acre property off New York Avenue NE. Wednesday marked the 35-day mark for the first egg’s incubation period, so experts at the American Eagle Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have been closely tracking and watching the pair’s movements using a live streaming system for the past few weeks as hatch time nears. The parents have been nicknamed — “Mr. President” and “The First Lady.” They take turns keeping the eggs warm. [‘Mr. President’ and ‘The First Lady’ nest at National Arboretum] On Wednesday there was a photo from the cameras that showed a slight beak near the edge of the egg. “We were right on the money,” said Julia Cecere, a spokeswoman for the American Eagle Foundation, in terms of the first egg hitting its 35-day incubation period. “We weren’t sure at first. … The picture was not clear. We were wondering is it a pip or not?” A pip is considered to be a crack in the egg’s shell and shows up as the eaglet begins to emerge. Experts said it could take between 12 and 48 hours for an eaglet to completely emerge from the shell. Cecere said the first crack was at the top of the egg. But by 10 p.m., it became more clear as one of the eagles got off the egg and they could see a clearer crack from the live camera. In a Facebook post, the eagle foundation said late Wednesday night that “the pipping process has begun on the DC Eagle Cam!” A close up look at 1:58 p.m. Thursday shows a beak of a bald eagle poking near the surface of one of the eggs as the hatching process is underway at the National Arboretum in Northeast Washington. (Courtesy of the American Eagle Foundation) On Thursday, the foundation sent out more pictures and updates throughout the day. Thursday night, the adult birds could be seen standing, rolling the eggs and appear to straighten the nest. In a statement, Al Cecere — the American Eagle Foundation’s president, who is also Julia Cecere’ father — said Thursday, “This is a very special time in the nest.” Al Cecere, who was in the music-production business, created the foundation in 1985 and has received support from such stars as country music singer Dolly Parton. “To witness the up-close process of an eaglet breaking through its shell and being fed by its parents for the first time is wonderfully heartwarming,” he said in the statement. For now, the first one will tentatively be called “DC2.” And the sibling will be called “DC3.” The public will have a chance to come up with official names for the eaglets, the foundation said. The hatching was trending on Facebook, and the eagle foundation said it hit 100,000 likes, along with plenty of comments from viewers around the world who were watching the eaglet’s hatching and sharing on social media. When one of the birds left the nest to get fish, viewers took screen shots and commented. And they noted when flies seemed to be bothering the parents as they took turns, sitting on the nest to keep the eggs warm. One of the eagles at the National Arboretum brought a fish back to the nest. (National Arboretum) Facebook user Catherine Montalbo wrote, “I’m obsessed with the Eagle Cam!!” Raisa Harkema said, “Wow! It’s amazing to see this from the other side of the world! (Holland). And Tina Camporeale said, “Forget about Trump, start watching this, it’s much more interesting.” Read more: Bald eagles are adapting to city living Thirteen bald eagles were found dead on a Maryland farm ||||| WATCH LIVE In 2014, a pair of mated Bald Eagles chose the most idyllic of nest sites within the United States’ National Capital (Washington, DC), nestled high in a Tulip Poplar tree amongst the Azalea Collection at the U.S. National Arboretum, which is operated by the United States Department of Agriculture. This is the first Bald Eagle pair to nest in this location since 1947. The two Eagles have been iconically named ‘Mr. President’ and ‘The First Lady.’ Join us in viewing the most patriotic nest cam in the United States, 24 hours a day. ‘The First Lady’ laid her first egg of 2016 on February 10th, and laid her second egg on February 14th early in the morning. 'Freedom' (DC2) hatched at 8:27 a.m. March 18, 2016 Eastern Daylight Time. 'Liberty' (DC3) followed two days later, hatching March 20 at about 3:00 a.m. EDT. FAQ about these eagles The Bald Eagle was selected as the central image of the Great Seal of the United States by our Founding Fathers on June 20, 1782. For over 230 years, this precious national treasure has served as the pride of America’s skies and as the living symbol of all that America stands for: Freedom, Courage, Strength, Spirit, Independence, and Excellence. This is a wild eagle nest and anything can happen. While we hope that two healthy juvenile eagles will end up fledging from the nest this summer, things like sibling rivalry, predators, and natural disaster can affect this eagle family and may be difficult to watch.

There is a tiny bald eagle that just came out of its egg! This happened in a place called the National Arboretum. It’s like a super big garden in Washington, D.C. where people go to see all kinds of trees and plants. The little eagle's mom and dad have been living there since 2014, and people like to call them \\"Mr. President\\" and \\"The First Lady\\". They laid two more eggs last month, and we are waiting for the second egg to hatch very soon! Even better, there are special cameras that show us what’s happening in the eagle's nest all the time, so we were able to watch the egg hatch and see the baby eagle come out. The nest is really high up in a tulip poplar tree (that's a type of tree with pretty flowers). There are some people that work for the American Eagle Foundation who have been keeping a close watch and letting us know what's happening. They are super excited because the baby eagle looks strong and is eating well. And, they are going to let us help come up with names for the baby eagles!

It is an appropriate image: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, who authored such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of Broadway's most famous twisters, and under Sidney Lumet's direction it translates to the screen extremely well. DEATHTRAP is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss, for to do so in any detail gives away the very plot for which it is famous. But the opening premise is extremely clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mystery plays, but these days he seems to have lost his touch. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a script for a play he has written. It is called \\"Deathtrap,\\" and Sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit. Just the sort of hit that would revive his career... indeed, a hit to die for. And when Clifford visits to discuss the play, events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possible. Like Anthony Shaffer's equally twisty SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is really a story more at home on the stage than the screen--to reach full power it needs the immediacy that a live performance offers. Still, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, it makes a more-than-respectable showing on the screen. Much of this is due to the cast, which is remarkably fine. Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is funny and endearing as Sidney's relentlessly anxious wife, and Christopher Reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his regrettably short acting career.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American middle-class neighborhoods are on the decline and the divide between the rich and poor is widening, according to a study on Wednesday. The share of families living in middle-income neighborhoods has dropped to 44 percent in 2007 from 65 percent in 1970, the Stanford University study showed. The study sponsored by the Sage Foundation and Brown University covered the country's major 117 metropolitan areas. It supports views that the income inequality gap is widening and could put the distribution of public resources under the spotlight. \\"Given that in 2008 the top 10 percent of earners controlled approximately 48 percent of all income in the United States, the increasing isolation of the affluent from the low and moderate-income families means that a significant portion of society's resources are concentrated in a smaller and smaller portion of neighborhoods,\\" the study said. The study found that the proportion of families living in affluent neighborhoods doubled to 14 percent in 2007 from 7 percent in 1970. During the same period, the share of families in poor residential areas increased to 17 percent from 8 percent. While the study did not examine the impact of the 2007-09 recession on residential patterns, there is little doubt that the proportion of families residing in middle-class areas has dropped even further. This segment of the population has been hardest hit by the recession, which claimed more than 8 million jobs, most of them in manufacturing and construction. \\"The enormous number of housing foreclosures in the last few years has likely led many low-income families to move to lower-income neighborhoods, which would lead to increased income segregation,\\" the study said. \\"Conversely, declining incomes and income volatility among the middle-class may lead to lowered income segregation, because it may widen the income distribution within previously middle-income neighborhoods, or force these families to move into lower-income neighborhoods.\\" (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrew Hay) ||||| Much of the shift is the result of changing income structure in the United States. Part of the country’s middle class has slipped to the lower rungs of the income ladder as manufacturing and other middle-class jobs have dwindled, while the wealthy receive a bigger portion of the income pie. Put simply, there are fewer people in the middle. Photo But the shift is more than just changes in income. The study also found that there is more residential sorting by income, with the rich flocking together in new exurbs and gentrifying pockets where lower- and middle-income families cannot afford to live. The study — part of US2010, a research project financed by Russell Sage and Brown University — identified the pattern in about 90 percent of large and medium-size metropolitan areas for 2000 to 2007. Detroit; Oklahoma City; Toledo, Ohio; and Greensboro, N.C., experienced the biggest rises in income segregation in the decade, while 13 areas, including Atlanta, had declines. Philadelphia and its suburbs registered the sharpest rise since 1970. Sean F. Reardon, an author of the study and a sociologist at Stanford, argued that the shifts had far-reaching implications for the next generation. Children in mostly poor neighborhoods tend to have less access to high-quality schools, child care and preschool, as well as to support networks or educated and economically stable neighbors who might serve as role models. The isolation of the prosperous, he said, means less interaction with people from other income groups and a greater risk to their support for policies and investments that benefit the broader public — like schools, parks and public transportation systems. About 14 percent of families lived in affluent neighborhoods in 2007, up from 7 percent in 1970, the study found. The study groups neighborhoods into six income categories. Poor neighborhoods have median family incomes that are 67 percent or less of those of a given metropolitan area. Rich neighborhoods have median incomes of 150 percent or more. Middle-income neighborhoods are those in which the median income is between 80 percent and 125 percent. The map of that change for Philadelphia is a red stripe of wealthy suburbs curving around a poor, blue urban center, broken by a few red dots of gentrification. It is the picture of the economic change that slammed into Philadelphia decades ago as its industrial base declined and left a shrunken middle class and a poorer urban core. Photo The Germantown neighborhood, once solidly middle class, is now mostly low income. Chelten Avenue, one of its main thoroughfares, is a hard-luck strip of check-cashing stores and takeout restaurants. The stone homes on side streets speak to a more affluent past, one that William Wilson, 95, a longtime resident, remembers fondly. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “It was real nice,” he said, shuffling along Chelten Avenue on Monday. Theaters thrived on the avenue, he said, as did a fancy department store. Now a Walgreens stands in its place. “Everything started going down in the dumps,” he said. Philadelphia’s more recent history is one of gentrifying neighborhoods, like the Northern Liberties area, where affluence has rushed in, in the form of espresso shops, glass-walled apartments and a fancy supermarket, and prosperous new suburbs that have mushroomed in the far north and south of the metro area.

In a recent study of low-income families randomly assigned the opportunity to move out of concentrated poverty into mixed-income neighborhoods, Professor Katz and his collaborators found large improvements in physical and mental health, but little change in the families’ economic and educational fortunes. But there is evidence that income differences are having an effect, beyond the context of neighborhood. One example, Professor Reardon said, is a growing gap in standardized test scores between rich and poor children, now 40 percent bigger than it was in 1970. That is double the testing gap between black and white children, he said. And the gap between rich and poor in college completion — one of the single most important predictors of economic success — has grown by more than 50 percent since the 1990s, said Martha J. Bailey, an economist at the University of Michigan. More than half of children from high-income families finish college, up from about a third 20 years ago. Fewer than 10 percent of low-income children finish, up from 5 percent. William Julius Wilson, a sociologist at Harvard who has seen the study, argues that “rising inequality is beginning to produce a two-tiered society in America in which the more affluent citizens live lives fundamentally different from the middle- and lower-income groups. This divide decreases a sense of community.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A study conducted by Stanford University has shown that American middle-class neighborhoods are on the decline and the gap between the rich and poor is widening.

Jonathan O'Callaghan. The age of the smart home is well and truly upon us, but keeping track of all the different devices in a house can be difficult. That’s where Ninja Sphere comes in - the system is intended to monitor all aspects of a home and sync them with various devices. By tracking location and environment, the designers say Ninja Sphere can give the user intelligent control over a smart home. Scroll down for video. Sydney-based company is preparing to release a unified smart home device. The Ninja Sphere links different appliances in a home and controls them all. The central hub called a 'Spheramid' (shown) can be controlled by smartphones or gestures. - Be alerted if you have left home and left an appliance on, and easily turn it of, such as heaters or lamps. - See who is at home or away by detecting smartphones in the home. - See exactly where lost wallet and keys are located using a tag. - Be alerted if a valuable is being moved and you’re not at home, possibly suggesting an intruder is in the house. - Control of lights, media, and environment devices via natural gestures on top of the Spheramid. - Create ‘if this then that’ (IFTTT) style rules against presence, location or time such as: ‘If I’m on my way home and it’s cold outside turn on the heater.’ Australian company Ninja Blocks, based in Sydney, have now started accepting pre-orders for their Ninja Sphere system following a successful Kickstarter campaign, with delivery due in October this year. Using GPS, Zigbee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) it is able to detect devices and create a ‘map’ of them in a home. Through an app it can then sync with a phone or other devices to control them all. The brain of the entire system is the Spheramid, £180 (305), which acts as a central hub for different devices in the home. Around the house the user then needs to place contact, motion and temperature sensors supplied by the company, known as ‘Smart Sockets’. There can be configured with other services such as Nest, Philips Hue and Dropcam. Tiny devices known as a Waypoints also need to be placed around the house, which will allow the Ninja Sphere to locate things. This means, for example, it could show you where pets are in the house if they have a small Bluetooth-enabled collar. Ninja Sphere an open source modified version of Ubuntu Linux to operate. Shown here is one of the potential uses for Ninja Sphere. By syncing with a Smartwatch and lights it can alert a user that their lights are still on and let them turn them off using several devices. One of the touted benefits is also that, using tags on certain items, it can detect when they are being moved and send an alert to the user (shown). This could indicate than an intruder is in the home, for example. Using a phone or smartwatch, the central Ninja Sphere hub can then control other aspects of a home. For example, while watching the TV Ninja Sphere could alert a user on-screen if their phone is ringing in another room, and even tell them where it is. Or while out of the house it could send a message to a phone that items are being moved while the owner is not there - suggesting an intruder might be in the home. The device also has gesture-recognition software so, for instance, by waving a hand over the device the volume of music in a room could be altered. Or simply tapping the device could turn lights on and off. It’s not especially cheap at the moment, however: It costs £180 (305) for one Spheramid, in addition to the other sensors that are needed. And the company also recommends that at least one Spheramid is need for every floor of a home for it to work properly. Two per floor are needed if the house is especially big. ‘Your Ninja Sphere learns about you, and your environment,' says the company. 'It uses data from sensors and actuators to build a model that can inform you if something is out of place.’ ‘It can monitor temperature, lighting, energy usage, you and your pets' presence, and anything else you connect to your sphere. ‘By using data from your devices, environment, and location your sphere is able to advise you intelligently and give you control only when you need it.' Tiny devices known as a Waypoints also need to be placed around the house, which will allow the Ninja Sphere to locate things. This means, for example, it could show you where pets are in the house (shown) if they have a small Bluetooth-enabled collar.

Bill was protecting his house with a gun and not a stick because a lot of bears lived near him and a","completion":"stick simply wouldn't provide the level of security needed to deter or fend off such large, dangerous creatures. Step by step, Bill had taken measures to ensure his safety and the safety of his home in these bear-infested surroundings. Step 1: Research Local Bear Activity Bill started by gathering information on the types of bears present around his area, their activity patterns, and any known encounters. This helped him understand the potential threat that bears posed and informed him of the best safety measures to implement. Step 2: Strengthen Doors and Windows To prevent bears from accidentally or intentionally entering his home, Bill reinforced his doors and windows with heavy-duty materials, such as thicker glass and more robust locks. This provided an additional level of protection against potential break-ins. Step 3: Remove Attractants Around the Property Bears are known to be attracted by food odors and other smells that may lure them towards human dwellings. Bill ensured that he tightly sealed all his garbage cans, avoided leaving food waste outdoors, and cleaned his barbecue grill after each use to minimize any enticing scents. Step 4: Install Outdoor Security Measures Bill decided to install motion-activated lights out around his property to deter bears from approaching the house at night. Additionally, he put up an electric fence to create a physical barrier between his home and the surrounding wilderness. Step 5: Acquire and Learn to Use a Gun Knowing that a stick would not be sufficient to protect himself or his property in case of a close encounter with a bear, Bill decided to purchase a gun. He attended a firearms safety course and practiced at a shooting range to become proficient in handling and firing his weapon. This provided him with a reliable means of protection against any bear threats. Step 6: Develop an Emergency Response Plan Even with all these preventive measures in place, there was always a chance that a bear might still find its way onto Bill's property. To be prepared for such a situation, Bill created an emergency response plan, detailing how to safely retreat into his home and alert the authorities if needed. Step 7: Stay Informed Staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the local bear population was vital for Bill. He regularly checked for news announcements or alerts issued by the local wildlife department, as well as keeping in touch with his neighbors to stay informed about any bear sightings or incidents. By taking these steps, Bill felt confident in his ability to protect himself and his property from bears. The use of a gun instead of a stick was a necessary part of his home security plan, as it provided a powerful deterrent and defensive advantage in case of a close encounter with these mighty, unpredictable creatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"pigeons\\" when given the information that bears require water for survival. The correct answer, based on the given information, would be \\"bears.\\" However, it is important to note that nearly all living organisms, including pigeons and various other animals and plants, do require water for survival. Water is an essential component for life because it plays a crucial role in maintaining the biological functions, structure, and chemical reactions within living organisms. For instance, water is important for maintaining body temperature, digestion, absorption of nutrients, and waste removal. Additionally, it also serves as a solvent, meaning it helps dissolve substances and facilitate chemical reactions, which are critical for metabolism and other cellular processes. If we consider pigeons specifically, they too rely on water to survive just like bears. Pigeons need water for drinking, as it impacts their overall health, digestion, and metabolism. It aids in regulating body temperature, maintaining body tissue, and dissolving nutrients and minerals required to perform various bodily functions. Furthermore, pigeons also need water to bathe, as it is essential for grooming and maintaining the health of their feathers.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump is not expected to meet the leaders of Cuba and Venezuela when he attends the Summit of the Americas next week, according to White House officials. However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru. The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions. Despite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit. \\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\\" a senior administration official said. The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration. Trump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border. Trump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall. The disagreement become so heated earlier this year that Pena Nieto canceled plans to visit the White House.

Movie title: Slap Shot Context: Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) is the aging player-coach of the Charlestown Chiefs hockey team in the fictional Federal League. A perennial loser for years, the team's manager Joe McGrath (Strother Martin) has resorted to extreme cost-cutting techniques and embarrassing promotional antics to keep local interest alive. Dunlop, while not particularly talented as either a player or coach, is a skilled con man, and regularly manipulates the team to his own advantage. During a hopeless season, the Chiefs pick up the Hanson Brothers, bespectacled violent goons with childlike mentalities, complete with toys in their luggage. Horrified at being given players who seem stupid, immature, and unreliable, Dunlop initially chooses not to play them. When it is announced that the local mill will be closing and 10,000 workers will be unemployed, Dunlop grows concerned about the team's future. He makes several attempts to learn the identity of the team's anonymous owner (a running gag throughout the film), but is deftly deflected by McGrath each time. When McGrath accompanies them on an away game, top scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) overhears him attempting to get a job with another team. After Braden relays this information to his teammates, Dunlop confronts McGrath, who confirms that the Chiefs will fold at the end of the season. Determined to save the team at all costs, Dunlop starts provoking fights at games to secure goals and the Chiefs start to win games. In a moment of desperation, he lets the Hansons play and discovers that their aggressive fighting style enthralls the fans. He begins retooling the team as a goon squad in the Hansons' image and attendance quickly increases. Capitalizing on this growing interest, he plants a false story with eccentric sports news writer Dickie Dunn (M. Emmet Walsh) that a Florida retirement community is interested in purchasing the team, in order to bolster the confidence of the players and to hopefully inspire an actual sale.

It consists of two species of kite which form part of the subfamily Milvinae ; some authorities place these species in the genus Milvus , despite clear differences in behaviour , voice and plumage . - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - Milvus is a genus of medium-sized birds of prey. The genus name was the Latin for the red kite. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Plumage (\\"feather\\") refers both to the layer of feathers that cover a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies, and may vary with age classes. Within species there can be different colour morphs. - The red kite (\\"Milvus milvus\\") is a medium-large bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as eagles, buzzards, and harriers. The species is currently endemic to the Western Palearctic region in Europe and northwest Africa, though formerly also occurred just outside in northern Iran. It is resident in the milder parts of its range in western Europe and northwest Africa, but birds from northeastern and central Europe winter further south and west, reaching south to Turkey. Vagrants have reached north to Finland and south to Israel, Libya and Gambia. 'haliastur' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'parent taxon'?

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while","completion":"The given review appears to convey a negative opinion of the movie. The phrase \\"various victimized audience members\\" suggests that the movie was not well-received by the people who watched it, and they felt mistreated or harmed in some way by the experience. This could imply that the film was emotionally taxing or frustrating to watch, lacked engaging content, or failed to meet their expectations. Moreover, the reviewer's statement \\"feel like the movie's... after a while\\" indicates that they resonate with the negative experiences of the audience members, and the use of the word \\"victim\\" creates a sense of sympathy towards these viewers. The overall tone is disapproving, which points towards the reviewer's dissatisfaction with this particular movie. To sum up, the review clearly presents a negative opinion of the movie, as it expresses a shared sentiment of disappointment and the notion that the audience members were \\"victimized\\" by the film.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: You might see your teacher as only being a teacher, but keep in mind that they have a life of their own. Your teacher may be going through problems in their personal life, be stressed out from bad students, or be tired from working so much. Don't be too hard on your teacher and remember that they are a person too. Ask your teacher about their weekend, or what their favorite movies are. They'll appreciate you making an effort to learn more about them. You and your teacher don't have to be best friends, but you should be able to work together in a stress-free environment. Don't be a nuisance or give your teacher a hard time, and they'll most likely stop giving you a hard time. If you focus on your schoolwork and treat your teacher with respect, they should have no reason to dislike you. If your teacher seems to dislike you, it may be difficult for you to treat them with respect. However, if you're able to be respectful with your teacher while discussing schoolwork or personal issues, they may start to develop a mutual respect for you. When issues arise in the future, talk to your teacher respectfully, and in private, to hopefully resolve the issue. Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of understanding that teachers are people too, with their own personal lives and challenges. It encourages students to treat their teachers with respect and be mindful of the difficulties teachers may face, such as dealing with bad students, personal problems, or being overworked.

Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described \\"kinetic energy\\" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, William Rankine coined the term \\"potential energy\\". The law of conservation of energy was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system. It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the caloric, or merely a physical quantity, such as momentum. In 1845 James Prescott Joule discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who rejected the term \\"potential energy?\\"","completion":"It is not explicitly known who rejected the term \\"potential energy,\\" as the concept was a natural progression in the development of energy as a distinct quantity in the scientific understanding. As mentioned earlier, it was William Rankine, a Scottish physicist, who first coined the term \\"potential energy\\" in 1853. While some scientists at the time may have had disagreements on the terminology or the understanding of potential energy, it was not a single individual's outright rejection that defined the term. Potential energy represents the stored energy of an object due to its position or condition, and it contributes significantly to the overall understanding of energy conservation. Over time, the concept of potential energy became widely accepted, and it is now a fundamental aspect of physics and energy studies. As science and our understanding of the world progress, there will always be debate and disagreement among scientists, but in this specific case, it is not possible to attribute the rejection of the term \\"potential energy\\" to a particular individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. First question: Is negative inflation good? Second question: Why is negative inflation considered undesirable? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let's analyze the questions individually: 1. Is negative inflation good? To answer this question, I will examine the definition and implications of negative inflation and then evaluate if those aspects are generally considered good or not. Negative inflation is a situation where the rate at which the general price level of goods and services is falling. This is also known as deflation. When it occurs, the currency gains value over time, and people can buy more goods and services with the same amount of money. Whether negative inflation is good or not can depend on the context and duration. In the short term, it may be beneficial for consumers as their purchasing power increases, but it can also lead to decreased economic growth. In the long term, however, negative inflation can be harmful due to these negative effects. 2. Why is negative inflation considered undesirable? To answer this question, I will discuss the potential drawbacks of negative inflation and provide reasons why it may be regarded as undesirable. Negative inflation can lead to several issues within the economy: - Lower consumer spending: People may delay their spending, expecting prices to fall further. This decreased demand will lead to reduced production, job losses, and overall economic decline. - Debt burdens: Deflation can make debts effectively larger, as the real value of the debts increases. This results in added pressure on borrowers, increasing the risk of default and negatively impacting the financial system. - Business investment reduction: With falling prices, businesses may hold off on investing in new projects due to lower profit expectations. This in turn can contribute to a decline in innovation, growth, and overall competitiveness of businesses. - Stagnant wage growth: Employers may be less inclined to increase wages in a deflationary environment, leading to reduced consumer spending and a further downturn in the economy. Now, let's address if the questions are essentially asking the same thing: While both questions are related to negative inflation, they are not asking the same thing. The first question focuses on whether negative inflation can be considered good, while the second question asks for reasons why negative inflation might be seen as undesirable. Although the answers to these two questions are interconnected, they are not exactly the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: A snowstorm is hitting what city? Title: Home Alone 3 Movie plot: Peter Beaupre, Alice Ribbons, Burton Jernigan, and Earl Unger, four internationally wanted hitmen working for a North Korean terrorist group, have stolen a US10 million missile cloaking computer chip. The thieves put it inside a remote control car to sneak it past security at San Francisco International Airport. However, a luggage mix-up occurs, causing a woman named Mrs. Hess to inadvertently take the thieves' bag containing the remote control car while returning home to Chicago. The four thieves arrive in Chicago and systematically search every house in Hess's suburban neighborhood to find the chip. Meanwhile, Alex Pruitt is given the remote control car by Hess for shoveling snow, but she lectures him for scratching numerous itches. He returns home and removes his shirt to discover that he has chickenpox, and therefore must stay out of school. While recovering at home, Alex uses his telescope and discovers the thieves on look out for the chip. Wondering what the thieves want with a remote control car, Alex opens it and discovers the stolen chip. He informs the local Air Force Recruitment Center about the chip while asking if they can forward the information about the chip to someone. The thieves conclude that Alex has been watching them and decide to pursue him. As a snowstorm hits Chicago, the thieves block off the road to the house, and Alice duct tapes Hess to a chair in her garage and leaves the door open. By this point, Alex has armed his house with booby traps and prepares to set them off with his pet rat, Doris, and the loud-mouthed pet parrot of his brother, Stan. After several break-in attempts, the thieves manage to make it into the house, despite falling into Alex's traps. They begin to search the house to find Alex.

Jonathan Luther \\"Casey\\" Jones (March 14, 1863 - April 30, 1900) from Jackson, Tennessee, was an American railroader who worked for the Illinois Central Railroad (IC). He was killed on April 30, 1900, when his train collided with a stalled freight train near Vaughan, Mississippi. His dramatic death while trying to stop his train and save the lives of his passengers made him a hero; he was immortalized in a popular ballad sung by his friend Wallace Saunders, an African-American engine wiper for the IC. As a boy, he lived near Cayce, Kentucky, where he acquired the nickname of \\"Cayce\\", which he chose to spell as \\"Casey\\". During the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, Illinois, in 1893, IC was charged with providing commuter service for the thousands of visitors to the fairground. A call was sent out for trainmen who wanted to work there. Jones answered it, spending a pleasant summer there with his wife. He shuttled many people from Van Buren Street to Jackson Park during the exposition. It was his first experience as an engineer in passenger service and he liked it. At the fair (also called The Chicago World's Fair), he became acquainted with No. 638, a big new freight engine IC had on display as the latest and greatest technological advancement in trains. It had eight drive wheels and two pilot wheels, a 2-8-0 \\"Consolidation\\" type. At the closing of the fair, No. 638 was due to be sent to Water Valley for service in the Jackson District. Jones asked for permission to drive the engine back to Water Valley. His request was approved, and No. 638 ran its first 589 miles (948 km) with Jones at the throttle to Water Valley. Jones liked No. 638 and liked working in the Jackson District because his family was there. They had once moved to Water Valley, but returned to Jackson, which they felt was home. Jones drove the engine until he transferred to Memphis in February 1900. No. 638 stayed in Water Valley. That year he drove the engine that became most closely associated with him, for one time. That was Engine No. 382, known affectionately as \\"Ole 382.\\", or \\"Cannonball\\". It was a steam-driven Rogers 4-6-0 \\"Ten Wheeler\\" with six drivers, each approximately six feet (1.8 m) high. Bought new in 1898 from the Rogers Locomotive Works, it was a very powerful engine for the time. When a potential disaster arose, all of Jones' skill and the engine's responsiveness were put to the greatest test. His regular fireman on No. 638 was his close friend, John Wesley McKinnie, with whom he worked exclusively from about 1897 until he went to the passenger run out of Memphis. There he worked with his next and last fireman, Simeon T. \\"Sim\\" Webb in 1900.

Summarize the following: The oxygen sensors are small metal pieces attached to wires that connect into the sides of the exhaust pipe. Place a wrench around the bolt connecting the sensor to the pipe and rotate it counterclockwise until it’s loose. Pull the oxygen sensor straight out from the pipe before unplugging it from the wires connecting to your vehicle. Your vehicle will usually have 1–2 oxygen sensors connected to the exhaust, but it may vary between make and model. Vehicles only have oxygen sensors if they have a catalytic converter. If your vehicle is from 1974 or prior, then the exhaust may not have oxygen sensors. Lie on a rolling creeper trolley to move around under your vehicle more easily. You can buy a creeper trolley from an automotive supply store. Wear clothes that you don’t mind getting dirty as well as disposable gloves so you don’t get too greasy. Penetrating fluid works between the bolt and nut threadings to add lubrication and make it easier to unscrew the system. Point the spout of the penetrating fluid directly at the nuts connecting the exhaust pipe to the downpipe attached to your engine. Make sure to coat all of the threadings evenly to make the job easier. You can buy penetrating fluid from your local hardware or automotive care store. If you don’t have any penetrating fluid, it may be difficult to remove your exhaust system on your own. If your exhaust system is made up of multiple pieces, then look for bolts where the pieces connect to one another. Spray those with your penetrating fluid as well so you can remove each of the pieces separately. Start where your exhaust pipe connects to the engine at the front of your vehicle. Choose a ratchet bit that matches the size of the nuts holding the exhaust system to your vehicle. Place the end of the ratchet over the nut you’re loosening and turn it counterclockwise. Apply firm pressure as you rotate the nut since it may be stuck or locked in tightly. Continue unscrewing the rest of the nuts if the pieces of your exhaust system are held together by other bolts or clamps. Use a ratchet with a long handle so you can get more leverage while you’re disconnecting the old exhaust system. Look near the top of the pipe along its entire length to find the metal pins that extend up and into rubber rings on your vehicle’s body. Support the exhaust pipe with your nondominant hand as you slide the metal pin out from the rubber. Slowly and carefully take the other pins off so the exhaust system comes loose from the body of your vehicle. If you have trouble pulling the metal pins off of the rings, try lubricating them with soapy water to help them slide out more easily. Don’t let the exhaust pipe drop since it could be heavy and it may hurt you or damage other components under your vehicle.

Carefully remove the system out from underneath the vehicle so it’s out of the way while you’re working.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store.

While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little. At that point, I started to get the idea… but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do.

Hex Enduction Hour was the first Fall album to make the UK Albums Chart, where it spent three weeks, peaking at no. 71. By mid-1983 it had sold 20,000 copies, reflecting a surge in the band's popularity, and five years into their career brought them to the attention of record labels. Critics were highly enthusiastic; according to Simon Ford, they could \\"have hardly been more supportive\\". Reviewing the album in the NME, Richard Cook described the band as tighter and more disciplined than in earlier recordings, \\"their master piece to date\\", while still maintaining their impact. He praised the band's use of recording-studio techniques and atmospherics without resorting to glamorisation. Melody Maker's Colin Irwin said it was \\"incredibly exciting and utterly compelling\\". A dissenter was Neil McCormick of Irish fortnightly Hot Press, who dismissed the album as secondhand melodramatic punk and wondered if the album was \\"meant to be minimalist or primitive then it fatally ignores the true primitivism of the strong melody and accessible lyrics found in folk music.\\"Later, Record Collector described the album as a \\"taut, twitchy and ominous masterclass in DIY post-punk\\", and singled out Smith's lyrics for praise.

As such, they'll make the area less inviting to scorpions. Keep in mind that scorpions are nocturnal and chickens are not, so chickens won't have much opportunity to hunt scorpions themselves. This natural substance is made from ground up fossils. It's a fine white powder that can be sprinkled in doorways, cracks and crevices both indoors and outdoors. It's completely safe for humans and pets to be around, but the tiny shards of fossil effectively pierce scorpions' exoskeletons when they happen to scuttle over the powder. Diatomaceous earth also kills spiders, roaches and other insects. The same traps that can be used to get rid of mice or roaches work for scorpions, too. Set them up in dark corners and near sources of water. If you catch a scorpion, throw the trap away and set out another one in the same area, since it's likely a spot that more scorpions will be attracted to.

Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona.

The movie, which flaunted A-list actors and promised a riveting thriller experience, fell vastly short of its larger-than-life expectations. The storyline is shallow and predictable, and does not employ the uniqueness needed to captivate audiences in today’s heavily competitive cinema world. To begin with, the plot stacks cliché upon cliché – a rogue agent, a love triangle, and a villain with intent on world domination. The narrative goes around in circles, making it further difficult to remain engaged. The story has the makings of a thrilling espionage film but fails to deliver any surprising twist or a memorable climax. The performances by the star-studded cast are sadly underwhelming. While the star actors have proven their acting skills in numerous other productions, the poor storyline combined with inadequate character development left them no room to flex their acting prowess. Thus, they end up appearing as shadowy caricatures of the roles they've effectively depicted in previous films. It is almost as if the script held them back from fully immersing in their characters. Moreover, many important scenes felt rushed or poorly edited making it difficult for the audience to follow the sequence of events. The action sequences too were nothing new or extraordinary, they merely felt like less exciting versions of scenes from other action movies. Even the score and sound editing, which can often salvage a poor movie, were pedestrian. They could not build the tension during crucial scenes and felt more intrusive than aiding the storytelling process. Imagery-wise, it's filled with run-of-the-mill visuals and lackluster cinematography, failing to provide the aesthetic appeal that modern audience craves. Even the special effects, which had the potential of being the film’s saving grace, were overdone and lacked finesse, giving off a sense of artificiality. The film had the potential to be a compelling narrative replete with suspense and dramatic elements. Still, the lack of originality, weak plot, and underwhelming performances all combined into a wasted opportunity of an exceptional cast and budget. To conclude, \\"The Phantom Illusion\\" is an unfortunate letdown, unable to engage viewers emotionally or stimulate their intellect. It is a tedious watch that fails to deliver on action, plot, or character development. Despite the spectacular promises made by its trailer and the well-known actors, the movie disappointingly falls into the array of forgettable productions. Especially given the talent of the cast and the resources available, the film leaves much to be desired and thus, unfortunately, does not merit a recommendation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last of the person who was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience? ? Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would...","completion":"The last name of the person who was in dire need of money, felt no inspiration to compose, and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience is Bartók.

The Ivorian forward, known for his electric pace and lethal finishing skills, has expressed his delight at the prospect of joining the Lisbon-based outfit, and is eager to make an immediate impact in his new surroundings. Born in Abidjan, Ivory Coast on December 31, 1987, Doumbia began his footballing journey with the local side Athletic Adjamé in 2003. A move to the Ivorian Premier Division's most successful club ASEC Mimosas followed in 2004, where he enjoyed a productive three seasons, amassing an impressive goal-scoring record. This prompted Swiss side BSC Young Boys to bring him to Europe in 2008, and the African striker wasted no time in making his mark, netting 20 goals in his debut season. His exploits in Switzerland did not go unnoticed, and Russian heavyweights CSKA Moscow came calling in 2010. In the Russian capital, Doumbia truly came of age – his skill, speed, and predatory instincts making him one of the most feared forwards in the continent. He left Moscow in 2015, moving to AS Roma, but struggled to replicate his form in Italy, necessitating loan stints with CSKA Moscow, Newcastle United, and Basel. Now, as he arrives at Sporting Lisbon, Doumbia is presented with a fresh opportunity to showcase his immense talent and reaffirm his status as one of Africa's leading football stars. The Portuguese giants, who finished at third place in the Primeira Liga last season, will be counting on the Ivorian's goal-scoring prowess to propel them towards the summit of domestic football and make inroads in the European competitions. Sporting's head coach, Rúben Amorim, will be acutely aware of the multitude of attacking options Doumbia brings to his team. The Ivorian is equally adept at leading the line or slotting into a wide position, allowing Amorim to alter his tactics on the fly and add dynamism to the side’s offensive arsenal. Moreover, with the physical and technical demands of Portuguese football arguably more forgiving than that of Serie A, Doumbia could be set for a prolific campaign in front of goal. Upon joining the club, Doumbia said, \\"I am very happy to be here. It's an honor to wear the Sporting Lisbon jersey. I'm looking forward to giving my best for the club and scoring as many goals as possible. I think my style of play will suit the team's needs, and I can't wait to get started.” His enthusiasm bodes well for the Lisbon outfit, who will be keen to capitalize on the momentum generated by this marquee signing. For fans and players alike, this loan move is an exciting development, as the club seeks to regain its position among Portugal’s footballing elite. Seydou Doumbia's arrival at Sporting Lisbon signals a statement of intent from the Verde e Brancos, and if the Ivorian can rediscover his best form, the club's ambitious aspirations might just become a reality. As the upcoming season dawns, observers of Portuguese football will be keeping a keen eye on the Estádio José Alvalade, eagerly anticipating the Doumbia-inspired fireworks to begin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament.

The island is 9. 6 km long and 5. 1 km wide. It has an area of 37, 3 square kilometers. It became a World Heritage Site in 1988 because of its bird life. All the four kinds of special land birds can only be seen on Henderson Island. There are also fifteen non-local seabirds. Other local things include nine kinds of plants, four kinds of land snails, and one butterfly. Although no people live on the island, archaeological evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life. On January 29* 1606, Henderson Island was discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fermandes, who named it San Joao Baptista. On January 17, 1819, the island was rediscovered by British Captain Henderson, who named it Henderson Island. On March 2* 1819* Captain Henry King, sailing on the Elizabeth, landed on the island to find the Union flag already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship on a tree, and for some years the name of the island was Elizabeth or Henderson. In the early 1980's, American businessman Arthur expressed interest in buying Henderson Island, and establishing a small settlement with an airport, farm and large houses. But the British government refused it at last* after environmentalist groups persuaded them to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island which became a World Heritage Site later.

By Maggie Fox Romaine lettuce is safe to eat as long as it's not from California’s Central Coast growing region, federal health officials said late Monday. So far, an outbreak of E. coli linked to romaine lettuce has made 43 people sick in 12 states, plus another 22 in Canada, the Food and Drug Administration said. The FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they had narrowed down the suspect lettuce to lettuce harvested in northern and central California. They still don’t have enough information to name a specific grower or distributor, but said consumers can begin to look for the popular lettuce again. Last week, the CDC and FDA told people not to eat any romaine lettuce at all and said stores should take it off the shelves. But, \\"over the Thanksgiving holiday, the FDA continued to investigate the outbreak. Our investigation at this point suggests that romaine lettuce associated with the outbreak comes from areas of California that grow romaine lettuce over the summer months, and that the outbreak appears to be related to 'end of season' romaine lettuce harvested from these areas,\\" FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. \\"Knowing the growing origin of produce will continue to play an important role in allowing consumers to avoid contaminated products and facilitating market withdrawals and tracebacks,\\" the head of the FDA said. AP So people can eat some romaine confidently. “If you do not know where your romaine lettuce is from, do not eat it,” the CDC said in a statement. “There is no recommendation for consumers or retailers to avoid using romaine lettuce that is certain to have been harvested from areas outside of the Central Coast growing regions of northern and central California,” the FDA added. “For example, romaine lettuce harvested from areas that include, but are not limited to the desert growing region near Yuma, the California desert growing region near Imperial County and Riverside County, the state of Florida, and Mexico, does not appear to be related to the current outbreak. Additionally, there is no evidence hydroponically- and greenhouse-grown romaine is related to the current outbreak.” There’s been a \\"clean break\\" from romaine, so product that could have been contaminated is probably gone from stores, Gottlieb said. He said the FDA was working with the food industry to come up with better ways to label the origin of lettuce and other fresh produce. That will help identify the source of future food-borne outbreaks. \\"Knowing the growing origin of produce will continue to play an important role in allowing consumers to avoid contaminated products and facilitating market withdrawals and tracebacks,\\" Gottlieb said. The FDA urged stores and distributors to label lettuce by origin. “Based on discussions with producers and distributors, romaine lettuce entering the market will now be labeled with a harvest location and a harvest date or labeled as being hydroponically- or greenhouse-grown. If it does not have this information, you should not eat or use it,\\" the FDA advised. E. coli is normally harmless, but there is a strain called E. coli 0157:H7 that produces a compound called Shiga toxin that can make people very ill. The CDC says 16 people have been hospitalized in this outbreak and one has a serious kidney condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome. This outbreak is linked to an outbreak one year ago that was not directly linked to romaine lettuce by U.S. authorities, but only to salad greens. Canadian authorities linked it to romaine at that time. A separate outbreak of E. coli in romaine lettuce in the spring was traced to contaminated irrigation canal water in Yuma, Arizona. Foodborne illnesses are very common. The CDC estimates that 48 million Americans get sick from a foodborne illness every year. Of them, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die. ||||| CLOSE An E. coli outbreak has led to the CDC to warn Americans to avoid romaine lettuce and JBS USA to recall close to 100,000 pounds of ground beef. USA TODAY Lisa Dennis of Regent Square selects a head of green lettuce from the vegetable shelves at the East End Food Co-op Federal Credit Union on Tuesday in Pittsburgh. Due to a recent consumer alert regarding a multi state E.Coli outbreak the Co-op has replaced their fresh and bagged romaine lettuce with blue signs reading, \\"The CDC has issued a Consumer Alert for romaine lettuce due to a multi state E.Coli outbreak.\\" The most-recent outbreak affects mostly women and girls, according to the CDC. (Photo: Jessie Wardarski, AP) Only romaine lettuce from certain parts of California is unsafe to eat, federal health officials announced Monday. The multi-state outbreak of E. coli infections has been traced to the Central Coast regions of California, according to a statement from Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb. “Romaine lettuce that was harvested outside of the Central Coast growing regions of northern and central California does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,” Gottlieb said. “There is no recommendation for consumers or retailers to avoid using romaine harvested from these sources.” Romaine lettuce entering the market will now be labeled with information about when and where it was harvested, according to Gottlieb's statement. If a product does not have this information, consumers are advised not to eat or use it.

Here are latest details about E. coli outbreak The FDA also said the market appears to have been successfully purged of potentially contaminated romaine lettuce related to the outbreak thanks to the market withdrawal request of Nov. 20. The vast majority of the romaine on the market was being grown in the Central Coast region of California at the time of the outbreak, according to the statement. Romaine harvesting has ended there for the year and has since shifted to winter growing regions including Florida, Mexico and desert regions in California and Arizona. The FDA said it has no information to suggest that these growing areas are tied to the current E. coli outbreak. Hydroponic lettuce and lettuce grown in greenhouses also do not appear to be affected by the outbreak. The outbreak has sickened 43 people in 12 states, plus 22 people in Canada, according to the FDA. That's up from 32 people sickened, including 13 hospitalized, in 11 states last week, and there could be more cases coming. Twenty days is the average amount of time that passes between when a person falls ill and when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is alerted, according to the FDA.

Most at risk for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections are those younger than 5, older than 65 and with weakened immune systems. The CDC has advised consumers to throw away any romaine lettuce they have in any form, such as whole heads, hearts or salad mixes containing it. If you don't know if your lettuce is romaine, play it safe and toss it, too. Also, sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators where romaine was stored using soapy water and, if desired, bleach. Last week, the FDA said the strain of E. coli O157:H7 causing the current outbreak is genetically link to the strain the caused an outbreak last fall in the U.S. and Canada Twenty-five people got sick — including one death and two incidents of hemolytic uremic syndrome — in 15 states. Federal investigators have found no connection between the current outbreak and the one that started this past spring. There were 210 cases, including five people who died and 96 who were hospitalized.

In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States. Latinos are disadvantaged compared to White Americans and are more likely to live in poverty. They are the least well educated major ethnic group and suffered a 3% drop in high school completion rate while African Americans experienced a 12% increase between 1975-1990. In 1990, they constituted 9% of the population, but only received 3.1% of the bachelors's degrees awarded. At times when it is favorable to lawmakers, Latinos were considered \\"white\\" by the Jim Crow laws during the Reconstruction. In other cases, according to Paul Brest, Latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity. Latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education. Brest finds that stereotypes continue to be largely negative and many perceive Latinos as \\"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\\" Furthermore, native-born Latino-Americans and recent immigrants are seen as identical since outsiders tend not to differentiate between Latino groups.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The time frame where Latino rates fell and African American rates rose for high school completion was between 1975-1990."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The sentence brings out a critical evaluation of someone's behavior or personality, which is portrayed in an undesirable light.

Moreover, the phrase \\"as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature\\" strengthens the negative sentiment by suggesting a negative transformation in the person's attitude. The idea that one's experiences have made them \\"bitter\\" implies that they now possess a resentful or cynical outlook on life, which is often considered unfavorable for personal growth and healthy relationships. Additionally, \\"less mature\\" directly points out a decline in emotional growth and wisdom, implying that the individual has regressed instead of developing positively.

Utah is considering a bill that would allow patients with certain debilitating conditions to be treated with edible forms of marijuana. If the bill passes, the state's wildlife may \\"cultivate a taste\\" for the plant, lose their fear of humans, and basically be high all the time. That's according to testimony presented to a Utah Senate panel (time stamp 58:00) last week by an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration. \\"I deal in facts. I deal in science,\\" said special agent Matt Fairbanks, who's been working in the state for a decade. He is member of the \\"marijuana eradication\\" team in Utah. Some of his colleagues in Georgia recently achieved notoriety by raiding a retiree's garden and seizing a number of okra plants. Fairbanks spoke of his time eliminating back-country marijuana grows in the Utah mountains, specifically the environmental costs associated with large-scale weed cultivation on public land: \\"Personally, I have seen entire mountainsides subjected to pesticides, harmful chemicals, deforestation and erosion,\\" he said. \\"The ramifications to the flora, the animal life, the contaminated water, are still unknown.\\" Fairbanks said that at some illegal marijuana grow sites he saw \\"rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana. ...\\" He continued: \\"One of them refused to leave us, and we took all the marijuana around him, but his natural instincts to run were somehow gone.\\" During a Utah Senate panel on a bill that will allow certain patients to be treated with edible forms of marijuana, special agent Matt Fairbanks warned of the environmental costs associated marijuana cultivation on public land. (Utah State Legislature) It's true that illegal pot farming can have harmful environmental consequences. Of course, nothing about these consequences is unique to marijuana. If corn were outlawed and cartels started growing it in national forests, the per-plant environmental toll would be about the same. But backcountry marijuana grows are a direct result of marijuana's illegal status. If you're concerned about the environmental impact of these grows, an alternative is to legalize and regulate the plant so that people can grow it on farms and in their gardens, rather than on remote mountainsides. Now, regarding rabbits. Some wild animals apparently do develop a taste for bud (and, yes, best to keep it away from your pets). But I don't know that the occasional high rabbit constitutes grounds for keeping marijuana prohibition in place, any more than drunk squirrels are an argument for outlawing alcohol. And let's not even get started on the nationwide epidemic of catnip abuse. There was a time, not too long ago, when drug warriors terrified a nation with images of \\"the devil's weed\\" and \\"reefer madness.\\" Now, it seems that enforcers of marijuana law conjuring up a stoned bunny?

In testimony last week before the Utah state senate, and first spotted by the Washington Post, special agent Matt Fairbanks expressed “some severe concerns” about marijuana as a cash crop. “Now I deal in facts. I deal in science,” he said, citing his experience ranging Utah’s mountains as a member of the state’s “marijuana eradication” team to bolster his concerns. “Deforestation has left marijuana grows with even rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana,” Fairbanks declared, suggesting that hares were yet one more of an unknown number of species to have succumbed to a cannabis addiction. Leporine marijuana abuse was so severe, Fairbanks said, that “one of them refused to leave us, and we took all the marijuana around him, but his natural instincts to run were somehow gone.” “Personally, I have seen entire mountainsides subjected to pesticides, harmful chemicals, deforestation and erosion,” he added. “The ramifications to the flora, the animal life, the contaminated water are still unknown.” Fairbanks did not say why marijuana cash crops would be any more destructive than the corn and wheat crops that grow in Utah and have similarly destructive consequences, also by way of the pesticides, deforestation and erosion that farmers inflict on the environment. Nor did Fairbanks present science from environmental researchers or biologists, despite his assertion that “I come to represent the actual science. I want the science studied and looked at and specifically gone over.” The bill would legalize medical marijuana for people with severe conditions but would not go so far as Colorado’s legalization of the drug, and carries provisions that would ban “back-country” grows of the kind that Fairbanks warned against. Jeremy Roberts, president of the company Medical Cannabis Payment Solutions testified to that point, beginning: “I was kind of shocked to find out the killer rabbit of Caerbannog from Monty Python and the Holy Grail is actually in the Utah mountains.” The bill would require medical marijuana be grown indoors, Roberts said, “so the concerns of our mountains being overrun with cannabis are a little bit of a hyperbole”. “In terms of the environmental impact we’re talking about water and electricity,” he said. Although pesticides and herbicides are “an absolutely valid concern”, he added, the bill would require a laboratory to test for potency, inorganics, pesticides, fungus and mould – and would make Utah only the second state to necessitate lab tests. Roberts argued that such testing and licensing would end the mystery of what chemicals are in the marijuana currently bought from illicit vendors. “Evidently we hear that it makes rabbits go crazy if it’s grown in Utah, in the mountains, so one of the things we want to do is make sure we don’t have any crazed rabbits any more in Utah, and actually bring that into control into the Department of Professional Licensing.” Utah’s senate also heard passionate, emotional pleas in support of the bill. Forrest Shaw, a 42-year-old man, spoke about suffering from terminal prostate cancer and his experience with marijuana. “I wanted to be able to relieve some of my suffering,” he said, “I’m horrified of being taken away from my family and having my home taken away from me because I just want to seek out a little bit of peace.” Another man, Aaron Campbell, spoke of how three of his children have been diagnosed with a terminal neurological disorder, two of whom suffered failed bone marrow transplants. “It’s the stupidest thing ever for lawmakers to tell me what me and my doctors cannot do,” he said, before adding, his voice breaking, “I have full intentions of bringing cannabis into Utah and treating my daughter.” “We are Utah, we can do this, we are not Colorado,” he said. Time to take the high road and legalize marijuana – at the federal level | Nushin Rashidian and Alyson Martin Read more State senator Mark Mardsen also said that seeing children denied pain relief last year had helped move him to sponsor the bill. “I was frankly angry that public policy would have kept these kids for years from receiving something that was tremendous benefit to them and may well have saved lives.” Those who testified in opposition to the bill largely called for patience, saying the state should not “short-circuit the FDA process” and should wait for more research. Physicians remain divided about the health effects of marijuana, vouching for its analgesic effects but calling for more research into its consequences and potential for abuse, especially among young people. For most mammals – from squirrels to monkeys to dogs and deer – drugs have the same consequences as they do for humans; for that reason pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies had until recently tested substances on beagles and chimpanzees for decades. Monkeys have shown symptoms of alcohol addiction and heroin withdrawal, and edibles lying around a home can easily intoxicate cats and dogs. But unlike the fermented fruits and coca leaves that animals might take a shine to in the wild, drugs such as the alcohol and the marijuana products consumed by humans sometimes contain chemicals that uniquely harm them (eg chocolate for dogs) in addition to their usual negative effects. And while rabbits and other wild creatures can suffer the effects of chemical inebriation, they remain unable to communicate with humans even on their sober days, and incapable of expressing even to experienced DEA agents exactly the degree of their high. |||||","completion":"A Utah bill is proposed to allow patients with certain debilitating conditions to be treated with edible forms of marijuana.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To examine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let us first understand the terms \\"premise\\" and \\"hypothesis.\\" A premise is a statement that provides the basis for a conclusion, while a hypothesis is a proposed explanation or assumption based on limited evidence that is subject to further investigation and testing. In this case, the premise is \\"that's an excellent movie,\\" and the hypothesis is \\"that movie was fantastic.\\" Both of these statements describe a movie with positive feedback but use different adjectives to characterize the film – \\"excellent\\" and \\"fantastic.\\" To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must analyze the relationship between the two statements. Entailment is a relationship between two statements where if the first statement (the premise) is true, the second statement (the hypothesis) must also be true. In other words, the truth of the hypothesis is guaranteed by the truth of the premise. Both \\"excellent\\" and \\"fantastic\\" are highly positive descriptors. If we consider their meanings, we can infer that an \\"excellent\\" movie delivers a high-quality experience to its viewers, while a \\"fantastic\\" movie evokes a similarly exceptional response. Given that their underlying meanings are quite similar, it is reasonable to conclude that one can imply the other. Now, let us apply the concept of entailment. If we assume that \\"that's an excellent movie\\" is true, it logically follows that the movie delivers a positive and high-quality experience to its audience. If the movie delivers a positive and high-quality experience, it can also be regarded as \\"fantastic,\\" even though the two adjectives are not necessarily interchangeable in every context. Thus, the hypothesis \\"that movie was fantastic\\" would also be true. In conclusion, based on the analysis of the meanings and relationship between the premise and hypothesis, one can infer that the premise \\"that's an excellent movie\\" does entail the hypothesis \\"that movie was fantastic,\\" as the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis within the context of a positive assessment of a movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What type of thing is the question \\"How do cameras take pictures ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"How do cameras take pictures?\\" is asking about the underlying mechanism, function, and principles behind cameras, particularly focusing on the process of capturing a photograph or image. This type of question is aimed at understanding the workings of a technology, in this case, a camera, and delving into the aspects of science, engineering, and design that contribute to its core functionality. To answer this question, we need to consider several aspects related to cameras: 1. Components of a camera: A camera consists of various components, including the lens, shutter, aperture, sensor (in digital cameras) or film (in analog cameras), and image processing mechanisms. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall functioning of the camera. Understanding the relationships between these components can help clarify how cameras capture images. 2. Optics: Cameras are essentially optical devices; they rely on the principles of optics to form images. The lens of a camera is responsible for gathering light from a scene and focusing it onto a sensor (for digital cameras) or film (for analog cameras). Fundamentals like the focal length of a lens, depth of field, and field of view are important concepts related to the optics of a camera, all of which contribute to the image capturing process. 3. Exposure: Exposure refers to the amount of light that reaches the camera's sensor or film. The aperture (the opening in the camera lens that controls the amount of light entering the camera) and the shutter speed (the duration for which the camera's shutter remains open) are two key factors that control exposure. Proper exposure is essential for producing a well-balanced and clear photograph. 4. Image sensor or film: In digital cameras, an image sensor (typically a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) or a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor) captures light and converts it into electrical signals, which are then processed into a digital image. In analog cameras, the light-sensitive film records the incoming light and captures the image through a chemical reaction. The differences in materials and technology between digital and analog cameras provide variations in how images are formed and stored. 5. Post-processing (Digital cameras): Once the image sensor captures the light information, the camera's internal processing unit transforms it into an actual digital image file, such as JPEG or RAW. Image processing algorithms play an essential role in adjusting various attributes like color balance, contrast, sharpness, and noise reduction to produce the final image. 6. Development and printing (Analog cameras): In traditional film cameras, the photographer needs to develop the film by using a darkroom and chemical process to convert the captured light on the film into a visible image on photographic paper. This step usually involves the use of an enlarger that projects the image from the negative film onto photo-sensitive paper, which is then processed using a series of chemicals to reveal the final photograph. In summary, the question \\"How do cameras take pictures?\\" is asking about the various components, principles, and processes involved in the image capturing journey – from light entering the camera, to the interplay of exposure, optics, and storage medium, and finally, to the transformation of light information into a permanent visible image."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me provide more information about each question and explain their differences. Question 1: How much is the average salary after the MAFED program from SDA Bocconi? The question focuses on understanding the average salary of graduates who have completed the Master in Fashion, Experience & Design Management (MAFED) program at SDA Bocconi School of Management. The MAFED program is a prestigious and comprehensive master's program in fashion management, aimed at shaping the future of the fashion and luxury industries. Graduates from the program often work in various roles within the fashion, luxury, and creative sectors. To answer this question, it would require gathering relevant data and statistics on the average salary of MAFED graduates after completing the program. This information is usually available on the school's website, in alumni surveys, or in external rankings and reports. It is important to note that salaries may vary based on factors such as individuals' prior work experience, the region in which they work, size and type of the employer, and the specific role they hold. Question 2: How much has your salary increased from your first job to today? This question is personal in nature and seeks to understand the salary progression for you (assuming you are a person). It is not specific to any particular field or program, nor is it asking for an average figure. To answer this question, one would calculate the difference between their current salary and the salary of their first job, then express this difference in a percentage or absolute terms. The main difference between the two questions lies in their focus. Question 1 is asking for the average salary of MAFED graduates from SDA Bocconi, while Question 2 is asking about an individual's salary progression over time, regardless of their field or area of work. In summary, the two questions are distinct in that they are targeting different information.

Answer the following question: Here's a question: If someone is looking for new carpeting where can they put it? Here are possible answers to this question: - gym - cub - home or office - istanbul - roon I believe the correct choice is \\"home or office\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"home or office,\\" and here's why: When someone is looking for new carpeting, their primary goal is usually to install it in an area where it will enhance the appearance, comfort, and functionality of the space. Among the options provided, the two most suitable settings for new carpets are homes and offices. Let's examine why each of the other choices is not ideal: 1. Gym: Although some gyms might have carpeted areas, it is not common practice due to the nature of gym activities. Gyms often involve exercises and activities that generate sweat and moisture, and carpet is not suitable for this environment due to the difficulties in keeping it clean and sanitary. Gyms typically use rubber or other non-absorbent flooring materials. 2. Club: By \\"cub,\\" it is assumed that you meant \\"club,\\" such as a social or nightlife venue. Although some clubs might have carpeted areas, these are not the places where people usually look to install new carpeting. Clubs usually employ hard flooring materials like tiles or concrete for easy maintenance and durability due to the high foot traffic. 3. Istanbul: Istanbul is a city and doesn't provide any context for carpet installation. It's important to focus on the type of space, such as a home or office, rather than a specific geographical location. 4. Roon: \\"Roon\\" appears to be a misspelling or typo. Assuming it's intended to mean \\"room,\\" this would be a more general term that could include various spaces within homes or offices. Therefore, it would still align with the \\"home or office\\" answer. In conclusion, the best option for someone looking to install new carpeting is to focus on spaces within a home or an office. These areas typically benefit from the aesthetic and functional advantages that carpets provide, such as visual appeal, insulation, and noise reduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).

It extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city of Suez. Its length is , including its northern and southern access channels. In 2012, 17,225 vessels traversed the canal (47 per day). - Cellulose is an organic compound with the formula , a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of (14) linked -glucose units. Cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes. Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. The cellulose content of cotton fiber is 90%, that of wood is 4050% and that of dried hemp is approximately 57%. - The State of India, also referred as the Portuguese State of India (\\"Estado Português da Índia\\", EPI) or simply Portuguese India (\\"Índia Portuguesa\\"), was a state of the Portuguese Overseas Empire, founded six years after the discovery of a sea route between Portugal and the Indian Subcontinent to serve as the governing body of a string of Portuguese fortresses and colonies overseas. - The São Francisco River or Rio São Francisco is a river in Brazil.

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Francisco Barreto (occasionally Francisco de Barreto, 1520 July 9, 1573) was a Portuguese soldier and explorer. An officer in Morocco during his early life, Barreto sailed to Portuguese India and was eventually appointed viceroy of the colony.

Passage:Menor was drafted 7th overall by the Barako Bull Energy Boosters in the 2009 PBA draft. He was then traded to the now-defunct Sta. Lucia Realtors and later played for the Meralco Bolts. He was waived by the team during the 2011 PBA Commissioner's Cup. Due to injuries to key players Mark Cardona and Chris Ross, Menor was re-signed by the Bolts. He was later traded to the Powerade Tigers during the off-season along with Chris Timberlake. However, he was not signed. He was then signed by the Clickers before the start of the season. In 2014, Menor played for expansion team Blackwater Elite for the 2014-15 season. Menor gained widespread attention on his 'butiki' (lizard in English) haircut that it even reached global attention from several sports websites around the world like ESPN and Bleacher Report.","completion":"Step 1: Identify the proper nouns in the passage. - Menor - Barako Bull Energy Boosters - 2009 PBA draft - Sta. Lucia Realtors - Meralco Bolts - 2011 PBA Commissioner's Cup - Mark Cardona - Chris Ross - Powerade Tigers - Chris Timberlake - Clickers - Blackwater Elite - 2014-15 season - ESPN - Bleacher Report Step 2: Analyze the question. - We need to find out how long Menor's first team (Barako Bull Energy Boosters) had been playing before he was drafted. Step 3: Determine if the information from more than one term is needed to answer the question. - The passage mentions that Menor was drafted in the 2009 PBA draft, which involves the Barako Bull Energy Boosters. To answer the question about how long the team had been playing before he was drafted, we would need information on when the team was established. Step 4: Justify the conclusion. - As the passage lacks information about when the Barako Bull Energy Boosters team was established, we cannot determine how long they had been playing before drafting Menor in 2009.

Este informe destaca la situación preocupante de pobreza que existe en todo el continente europeo, lo que sugiere que se necesitan acciones sociales adicionales y urgentes para abordar el tema. La \\"situación dramática de pobreza\\" mencionada en la declaración es resultado de una combinación de factores, como la crisis económica y financiera de 2008, políticas de austeridad y desigualdades crecientes entre los ciudadanos europeos.

The answer is:","completion":"No. Based on the provided review, it is clear that the user would not recommend this product for the AT&T Tilt. The essential factor leading to this dissatisfaction is the incompatibility of the product with the AT&T Tilt model. The screen protector - which is highlighted as scratch-resistant - was too large for the user’s device's screen. This aspect is critical since the improper fit of the screen does not only diminish the aesthetic appeal but also affects the functionality of the device. Usually, when a screen protector is larger than the screen, it leaves unwanted edges hanging over the sides, which can interfere with the phone's case or any other accessories that might be used in conjunction with the phone. These edges could also easily peel off, thereby compromising the protection the screen protector is supposed to offer. Moreover, the review mentions that the product is too large, but does not stipulate whether the screen protector can be trimmed down to fit. However, even if it could be trimmed, it demands additional effort from the user, which could be an inconvenience. Moreover, a screen protector's primary purpose is to protect the screen from scratches and other potential damage. If it does not fit appropriately, it cannot perform its primary function, which eventually defeats its purpose.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: HO Old/Reuters Teenage heartthrob Justin Bieber continues to draw ire after his visit to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam on Friday. After noting in the museum’s guestbook how “inspiring” it was to visit the home where Frank and her family hid from the Nazis for two years during World War II, he went on to opine that she “was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.” Staff posted Bieber’s note to the museum’s Facebook page, prompting many to “cringe at the insensitivity and the sheer ego of” the counterfactual fan club invitation. Frank died in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, so there is no way of knowing whether she would have enjoyed the nuanced strains of “Baby.” However, in addition to being one of the most important chroniclers of her time, Anne Frank was also a normal teenager. Was she a fan of pop culture? Somewhat. A few clues on this front can be found in the famous diary itself. In one of the earliest entries, dated Sunday, June 14, 1942, Frank imagines what it would be like to own a pet like Rin Tin Tin and writes of her and her classmates’ enjoyment of a movie featuring the dog on the occasion of her birthday party, a few weeks before the family was forced into hiding. Frank was also fond of the young adult novels of her era, particularly the books of Cissy van Marxveldt: “I’ve read The Zaniest Summer four times, and the ludicrous situations still make me laugh.” In these preferences, Frank was like most girls her age. Musically speaking, though, Frank’s tastes seem to have run highbrow. Along with the rest of her family, she enjoyed listening to classical music in private home performances before the war and later on the radio, and devotes much of a June 1944 entry to a loose review of a biography of Franz Liszt. Classical music also played into Frank’s nascent romantic life: “Sunday afternoon Peter came to see me at four-thirty, at my invitation. At five-fifteen we went to the front attic, where we stayed until six. There was a beautiful Mozart concert on the radio from six to seven-fifteen; I especially enjoyed the ‘Kleine Nachtmusik.’ I can hardly bear to listen in the kitchen, since beautiful music stirs me to the very depths of my soul.” Advertisement Frank did have a touch of tabloid fever however. She was so fond of collecting pictures of actors such as Greta Garbo and Ray Milland—she laments in a May 1944 entry that her “movie stars are in a terrible disarray and are dying to be straightened out”—that, according to Melissa Müller’s biography, at least one of her childhood friends found her “flightiness and fascination” with them annoying. But even as she drew some delight from celebrity culture, Frank resisted being lumped in with young girls who, as a contemporary polemic had put it, “occupy themselves with superficial things, without giving a thought to true beauty.” ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A teenage star named Justin Bieber visited the Anne Frank House, a museum in Amsterdam.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What is a reason to work with used materials during manufacturing?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"recycling reduces the resources needed to make something\\" and \\"recycling is the reuse of material\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","completion":"Working with used materials during manufacturing is beneficial mainly because it promotes recycling, which in turn reduces the consumption of natural resources and encourages the reuse of materials. By utilizing recycled materials in the production process, manufacturers can significantly cut down on the extraction and processing of raw materials, which often leads to decreased energy consumption and lower environmental impact. Moreover, recycling contributes to a more sustainable and circular economy, as it minimizes waste generation and promotes a more efficient use of available resources. As a result, manufacturing sectors can enjoy various benefits such as cost savings, improved resource management, and better risk mitigation due to reduced dependency on virgin materials. Another crucial advantage of using recycled materials during manufacturing is the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Since the extraction and processing of raw materials often require energy-intensive practices, incorporating recycled materials lessens the need for these activities. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions associated with production can be considerably reduced, which is a significant step towards combating climate change. Lastly, working with used materials can yield social and economic benefits. As recycling creates new job opportunities and supports local industries engaged in the reuse and recycling of materials, it fosters a more diversified and resilient economy that values sustainability and resource efficiency. In conclusion, the best answer to the question is: Incorporating used materials during manufacturing is essential because it supports recycling, which leads to reduced resource consumption, decreased energy use, lower environmental impact, and the fostering of a more sustainable and circular economy. This not only aids in combating climate change but also generates positive social and economic outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: For autosomal dominant disorders, a person with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to their offspring. For achondroplasia, this means there will be a 50% chance that each child will have achondroplasia. Since two copies are fatal, if two people with achondroplasia have a child, there is a 25% chance of the child dying shortly after birth, a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, and a 25% chance the child will have a normal phenotype. However, in 3 out of 4 cases, people with achondroplasia are born to parents who don't have the condition. This is the result of a new mutation. New achondroplasis mutations are associated with increasing paternal age (over 35 years). Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis. More than 98% of achondroplasia is caused by a G to A point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the FGFR3 gene, which causes a glycine to arginine substitution. This makes this particular nucleotide one of the most, if not the most, mutable base in the human genome. and the situation: Erin was born with achondroplasia. When this was found out her parents got tested fur the mutation and neither of them had it, As of today she is very concerned because she would like to he children. Answer the following question: Will a baby born to parents that both have achondroplasia have a higher or lower chance of survival shortly after birth? A:","completion":"A baby born to parents that both have achondroplasia will have a lower chance of survival shortly after birth compared to a baby born to parents where only one or neither parent has achondroplasia. When both parents have achondroplasia, there is a 25% chance that their child will inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent), leading to a severe and usually fatal condition known as homozygous achondroplasia. In this case, the baby is likely to die shortly after birth due to complications from the disorder. If only one parent has achondroplasia, the chances of the child inheriting the condition are lower (50% chance of inheriting achondroplasia and 50% chance of not). When neither parent has achondroplasia, the chances of the child being born with the condition due to a new mutation are even lower, as 3 out of 4 cases occur in children born to parents without the condition. Therefore, when both parents have achondroplasia, the overall chance of survival for their baby shortly after birth is lower compared to cases where one or neither parent has the disorder, due to the higher risk of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

We have this equation: -1025 * a = -569 * a + 2973 - 7989 We want to find what \\"a\\" is. First, let's move the -569 * a from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do that, we'll add 569 * a to both sides: (-1025 * a) + (569 * a) = -569 * a + 569 * a + 2973 - 7989 Which will become: (-1025 + 569) * a = 2973 - 7989 Now, let's subtract 1025 by 569: -456 * a = 2973 - 7989 Next, we need to subtract 2973 by 7989: -456 * a = -5016 Now, to find the value of \\"a,\\" we have to divide both sides by -456: a = -5016 / -456 When we divide -5016 by -456, we get: a = 11 So, the answer is a = 11!

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: As a public school superintendent , I believe the best way to prepare students for colleges and careers is to focus on providing instructional programs and opportunities that help them become good thinkers. To do this, teachers and actually everyone else in a community, should play a role as a \\"cognitive coach\\" to students, helping develop good thinkers among our youth. The best way for you to become a cognitive coach is to seek out and engage school children and adolescents in meaningful conversations. The objective here is to get kids talking about what they think, how they feel, and what they believe whenever and wherever you may find them. It may be in a classroom. It may be at the grocery store. It may be at a basketball game. It doesn't matter where as long as you engage students in a topical conversation and, hopefully, even a debate. Mainly, you want to encourage students to voice their opinion about things. Get them to take a position on \\"this thing, or that thing,\\" and ask them to support their position with evidence. Curiously enough, the simple process of engaging students in real life conversations and debates will serve to strengthen what they have learned in the classroom, and help them create their own knowledge about a subject or a topic. Learning indicates that a student has been exposed to material, understands the material, and can recall the information. Knowledge, on the other hand, goes beyond recall and includes information processing, application to other situations, consideration of meaning, and contrasting with other concepts. Naturally, the topic of conversation you engage in with one of your learners will differ from student to student, and in the level of complexity based on child's age and developmental level. Even a kindergartener has an opinion about things that are going on in his or her life. Engaging in conversation with any members of your learning community in ways that get at what they have learned and what they know will help them develop higher order reasoning...

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: who put the bible in verses Suggested answer: Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. in Hebrew Bibles is numbered as in Christian translations. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"It seems like the suggested answer isn't clear and comprehensive enough. I would not validate this answer. Here's a more detailed response that might be more helpful: The process of dividing the Bible into chapters and verses happened over time and involved several individuals. The Bible consists of two main parts: the Old Testament, which is primarily based on Hebrew scriptures, and the New Testament, consisting of early Christian writings. The division of these texts into chapters and verses was not part of the original writings but was introduced later for easier navigation, referencing, and study. The division of the Old Testament into chapters and verses can be attributed to several sources. Around the 10th century CE, Jewish scholars known as the Masoretes began introducing divisions into the Hebrew text. They divided the text into verses based on the natural syntax and meaning in each sentence. They also introduced spaces between sections, known as parashot or sedarim, which aided in reading. As for the New Testament, the division into chapters is credited to Stephen Langton, an Archbishop of Canterbury, in the early 13th century CE. Langton's chapter divisions, which followed a similar purpose to the Masoretic divisions, gained widespread acceptance and were later integrated into Hebrew and Latin versions of the Old Testament. The division of the New Testament and the Hebrew Old Testament into verses can be credited to Robert Estienne (also known as Robertus Stephanus), a French printer and classical scholar. Estienne introduced the verse numbering system in the 1550s while working on publishing the Greek New Testament and the Latin version of the Old Testament. He sought to produce an easy-to-reference edition of the Bible that could be used for printing comparative texts. His numbering system gained rapid acceptance and soon became a standard way to reference and study the Bible. In summary, the division of the Bible into chapters and verses was a gradual process involving the efforts of multiple scholars and publishers. The Masoretes contributed to the initial verses and divisions of the Hebrew Old Testament, Stephen Langton introduced the chapters in the early 13th century CE, and Robert Estienne later refined the system by adding the verse numbers in the 16th century CE. This system has been used worldwide, facilitating scholarly study and discussion of the Bible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth. Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in England than in Nicaragua? Hint: \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\" Answer:","completion":"In light of the provided information regarding the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions, it can be inferred that the ecosystem functions in England would be less stable as compared to those in Nicaragua. Nicaragua, with its abundant biodiversity including hundreds of bird species and thousands of plant species, would have a more efficient, stable, and productive ecosystem. The high levels of biodiversity contribute to efficient resource capture, biomass production, decomposition, and nutrient recycling processes essential for maintaining stability in the ecological community. On the other hand, England has suffered a significant decline in biodiversity due to centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls. As a result, its ecosystem functions are less stable and efficient. Decreased biodiversity leads to less efficient resource capture, reduced biomass production, and a decline in the decomposition and nutrient recycling processes that are crucial for maintaining stability in the ecosystem. Moreover, diverse ecosystems are more resilient to environmental changes, as they contain key species with varying functional traits that aid in resource capture and contribute to overall productivity. Due to the loss of biodiversity, the impacts on the ecosystem processes in England might be substantial, making them less stable and on par with the effects of other global environmental drivers. In summary, the ecosystem functions in Nicaragua are likely more stable and efficient compared to those in England, primarily due to the higher levels of biodiversity in the Central American country. Such biodiversity helps in maintaining crucial ecological processes, which in turn, contributes to the overall resilience and stability of the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Atlantic coast of the United States is low, with minor exceptions. The Appalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast-southwest trend to crustal deformations which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what later came to be the Appalachian mountain system. This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea. During what geological period did the Appalachian mountains reach their highest formation point? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The Appalachian Mountains are believed to have reached their highest formation point during the Permian period. The Permian period is a geologic time period that occurred about 298.9 million to about 252.2 million years ago. It was during this time that there was a significant amount of crustal deformation that led to the creation of this mountain system. The term \\"climax of deformation\\" indicates the time when the structural formation and compositional changes in a geographical entity, like the Appalachian mountains, reached their peak level of intense change or activity. According to the information provided, it's inferred that the highest formation point of the Appalachian mountains was during the Permian time due to this \\"climax of deformation.\\" However, it should be noted that these mountains are very old and have experienced many periods of uplift and erosion. Significant changes to the current height of the Appalachian mountain system were likely caused by a combination of crustal deformations, continued elevation along earlier deformation lines, and the survival of resistant rocks which persisted as residual mountains. Furthermore, more recent geological activities, such as crustal movements and changes in sea levels also played part in shaping the Appalachians. So, while the Permian period represents a pivotal epoch when the Appalachian Mountains were formed and probably reached their highest peak, the mountains' present-day features are the result of millions of years of geological activity and processes beyond the Permian period. Consequently, they have been reduced to moderate or low relief in the present day. Thus, while the highest formation point can be traced back to the Permian period, the evolution of the Appalachian mountain system is the product of multiple geological periods and varied earth movements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The last party congress was held in 1980, during which Kim Jong-un’s father - Kim Jong-il - was confirmed as the successor to the state’s founder, Kim Il-sung. Kim, 33, who is already the country’s supreme leader, is expected to use the congress to cement his leadership, declare North Korea a nuclear state and outline his vision for the nation’s economic and military future. The party’s official newspaper, said: “The [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] proudly joined the ranks of advanced nuclear and space powers while demonstrating the might of the invincible politico-ideological, military and youth power and is now dashing ahead toward to a socialist economic power and highly civilised nation.” In March, the UN Security Council approved its toughest sanctions yet on the nation, with an aim to withhold funds being used to finance the state’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, following a series of military tests this year. The sanctions have added to the socialist dynasty’s economic turmoil. Following the vote, US ambassador Samantha Power explained, “Virtually all of the DPRK's resources are channelled into its reckless and relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.” Speaking in New York ahead of a UN climate change conference, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Su-yong told reporters the economy remained at the forefront of the congress. He said: “One of the most important things through this party congress is to show to the entire world the union of our people. I'm sure our country will be even more vibrant after the party congress to build up a more prosperous and powerful, economically sound nation. “The first thing is to advance the pace of economic building for a powerful nation. The second is to improve the people's living standards and to find the best, optimum ways to improve the people's living standards under these circumstances, and the third, to strengthen our national defence capabilities. “The real source of power in our country isn't nuclear weapons or any other military means, but the single-minded unity of the people and the leader. This power of unity we have is the real source of power that leads our country into victory.\\" North Korea propaganda video depicts imagined attack on Washington The congress is likely to last four or five days.

Each year, the American-based group honors environmental activists from six different areas. The first three winners of the 2012 Goldman Prize are from Kenya, the Philippines and China. The Goldman Environmental Foundation says Ikal Angelei is a hero to those who live around Lake Turkana. The Kenyan woman received the award because of her efforts to stop a dam project on a river in Ethiopia. Critics say the dam will harm the lake and restrict the flow of water for people who live nearby. The Philippine island of Mindoro is home to those who depend on the area's natural resources for food and jobs. Edwin Gariguez became concerned when a European company announced plans to mine for nickel on the island. The Roman Catholic minister said waste materials from the mining project would pollute the water and destroy the forests. So he started a campaign to stop the project. In China, Ma June is working with businesses to clean up their pollution. He formed a group that collects information about pollution, and publishes it on the Internet. The Goldman Prize was also awarded to activists from Argentina, Russia and the United States. Sofia Gatica of Argentina is from a town where farmers commonly use pesticide products to protect soybean crops from insects. The town also has a high rate of cancer. Miz Gatica believed that pesticide use was responsible for the death of her baby. She worked with other mothers to get government officials to ban the use of chemicals near populated areas. Evgenia Chirikova objects to the plans to build a road through a protected forest just outside Moscow. She has demanded that Russian officials redirect the road away from the forest.

Instructions: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. You are also given a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph and the story. You need to come up with an answer to the given question; the answer will be a span from either the question or the story. In order to correctly answer the given question, you need to understand the relationship mentioned in the background paragraph and should be able to use it to understand that in the story. Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Input: Background Paragraph: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. Story: Andy is participating in this years science fair. He is testing how fast metal takes to rust. He rakes 3 pieces of iron one is a cube, and the other is a sheet both weighing the same. It takes the cube almost a week to fully rust but the sheet only takes 2 days. The only difference between the two is that the sheet has more surface area. He tries this again with a cylinder so the surface area is larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet and it takes about 4 days to fully rust. Question: Will making the surface area of iron larger increase or decrease how fast it rusts? Output:","completion":"Part #1: Understand causal or qualitative relationships in background paragraph. Usage: Increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. The nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. This shows that the larger surface area causes a faster rusting reaction between the iron and oxygen in the air. Part #2: Understand the story with the concepts of the background paragraph. Usage: Andy's experiment shows that the sheet, with a larger surface area, rusts in 2 days, and the cube, with a smaller surface area, takes a week to rust. The cylinder, with a surface area between that of the cube and sheet, takes 4 days to rust. This demonstrates the concept of larger surface areas leading to faster rusting. Part #3: Answer the given question using the understanding of the relationship and the story. Usage: Will making the surface area of iron larger increase or decrease how fast it rusts? Answer: increase. It meets the criteria because, as shown in both the background paragraph and Andy's experiment, larger surface areas lead to faster rusting as more of the solid substance is exposed to other reactants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously.

You might find a tear-jerking tragedy is just the thing you need to brighten your day. A team of researchers at Ohio State University, US, has found sad movies can make people happier, Science Daily reported last month. Many people find tragedies make them realize how good their own lives are, the study showed. \\"People seem to use tragedies as a way to reflect on the important relationships in their own lives,\\" said Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, leader of the study. \\"Tragic stories often focus on themes of eternal love, and this leads viewers to think about their loved ones and count their good and helpful things.\\" In the study, researchers gathered 361 college students and showed them the 2007 movie, Alonement.

This is because experiencing negative emotions such as sadness during a tragic movie prompts individuals to think more critically about their own life situations, ultimately leading them to reflect on and appreciate their close relationships. In contrast, positive emotions tend to signal that everything is fine and leave people feeling less inclined to contemplate their life and relationships more deeply. This phenomenon has ancient roots, as even the ancient Greeks recognized the link between the feeling of happiness that arises after witnessing sadness, which they called \\"catharsis\\".

Q: Women with menstrual cramps in New York state could have a new option for easing their monthly pains: medical marijuana. The New York State Assembly is considering a bill to add dysmenorrhea — the medical name for menstrual cramps — to the list of conditions for which doctors can legally authorize a patient to use medical marijuana. Under the state's law, only patients with the specific medical conditions named in the law can access medical marijuana in New York, according to Newsweek. Cancer, HIV and multiple sclerosis are among the conditions already on the list. Severe cases of dysmenorrhea can be \\"debilitating,\\" New York State Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal wrote in the bill. \\"Medical marijuana can alleviate many of the painful effects of dysmenorrhea.\\" [Healing Herb? Marijuana Could Treat These 5 Conditions] The bill, which still has several legislative hurdles to overcome, is supported by actress Whoopi Goldberg, who sells a line of medical marijuana products that are marketed specifically for period pain, Newsweek reported. But does marijuana really help with menstrual pain? There haven't been any rigorous studies that have shown that there's a benefit to using marijuana for menstrual cramps, said Dr. Charles Pollack, an emergency-medicine physician at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia and the director of the university's Lambert Center for the Study of Medicinal Cannabis and Hemp. And though there are good data showing that marijuana can help people with neuropathic pain, the pain from menstrual cramps doesn't fall into this category, Pollack said. Neuropathic pain is pain related to the nerves, such as a pinched or inflamed nerve. That said, \\"it's not out of the realm of the possible\\" that the drug could be helpful for women with menstrual cramps, Pollack told Live Science. This is because the female reproductive tract, and, in particular, the uterus and the lining of the uterus, has an \\"abundance\\" of endocannabinoid receptors, Pollack said. The chemicals in marijuana that are responsible for its effects in the body are called cannabinoids, and can bind to these receptors. The discovery of these receptors, for example, has led to some researchers thinking that marijuana may help women with endometriosis, Pollack said. Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which the tissue that normally lines a woman's uterus, called the endometrium, grows outside the uterus, the Mayo Clinic says. One area of research is considering whether marijuana may help both with easing the pain of endometriosis and slowing the growth of endometrial tissue, Pollack said. It's also possible that women with painful menstrual cramps benefit from the anxiolytic, or anti-anxiety, effects of marijuana, Pollack added. But because of the lack of data, it's difficult to draw conclusions about the drug's effects. \\"There's just a paucity of data in this regard,\\" Pollack said. And the drug may have downsides: Although it's \\"exceedingly unlikely\\" that someone will die from an overdose of marijuana, there are still questions about the possible effects of regular, long-term use, he said. Dr. Ranit Mishori, a professor of family medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine, told Live Science in 2016 that, \\"with the exception of a study in 1800s, I see no evidence in the medical literature that supports\\" the use of marijuana for menstrual cramps. Although there are barriers to studying marijuana in the U.S., \\"the alternative isn't to recommend a treatment in the absence of evidence,\\" Mishori said.

As the minutes pass by, the discomfort can develop into a crippling pain, making even simple tasks such as standing up straight seem utterly unbearable. That dreadful feeling has a name: Dysmenorrhea—the medical term for severe period pain commonly referred to as cramps. And it’s something experienced every month by hundreds of women all across America. While over the counter medicine like Midol can be helpful for many women, some 20 percent of women who suffer from cramps caused by their menstrual cycles each month experience such extreme dysmenorrhea that they can’t perform daily actives like getting out of bed and going to work, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. Now, relief may soon be on the way. The New York Assembly's Health Committee passed an initiative Tuesday that would add dysmenorrhea to the list of conditions necessary to qualify for medical marijuana use. If it becomes law, everyday women suffering from intolerable period pain could have legal access to pot with a medical marijuana card. “This is a woman’s health issue and for years women have suffered in silence. There’s Midol. You can take Advil, but really nothing more,” Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, a Democrat, who introduced the bill, told Newsweek during a phone call Wednesday. “Men have really been [the ones] who’ve run state houses, governorships, presidencies, and some issues that are just about women have gotten shortchanged and that’s because it’s not in men’s everyday consciousness.” The measure, called Assembly Bill 582, was approved in a 21-2 vote by the committee and it’s headed to the Assembly floor next. It would also need the OK from the New York Senate and Governor Andrew Cuomo. The bill’s only pushback so far came from two Republican Assembly members—both men—but Rosenthal is confident that members of the Senate would be more understanding of how helpful medical marijuana, a drug that people suffering from various types of chronic pain can legally use in New York, can be for women during menstruation, too. “There is some mild discomfort for some, but some women can’t leave their bed for a week,” Rosenthal said. “People are starting to understand that medical marijuana is a useful tool to relieve suffering and women’s suffering from severe menstrual cramps.” In New York, only people suffering from cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, Huntington's disease or chronic pain can get access to medical marijuana—not everyday women who naturally have periods and experience the pain that sometimes comes along with it each month. Rosenthal has become known as a champion for women’s issues. She worked last year to get a bill that removed sales taxes on feminine hygiene products signed into New York law, and she’s at the helm of passing another bill that would make feminine hygiene products free for women in prisons, homeless shelters and schools. For Assembly Bill 582, she is getting some extra help from a highly regarded medical marijuana advocate, who just so happens to be a well-known movie star and co-host of the daytime talk show, The View. “I met with a force of a woman named Whoopi Goldberg, and she’s been a longtime expert on medical marijuana. I met with her and spoke with her, and she’s been passionate about easing women’s suffering by using medical marijuana,” Rosenthal said. “I thought this was a great opportunity to create an impact with a passionate supporter and help women access something new that can help relieve what cripples some of them during that time of the month.” Goldberg introduced her own line of medical cannabis products in 2016 to combat menstrual pain with cannabis industry leader Maya Elisabeth. Under their Whoopi & Maya brand, women in legal marijuana states are able to receive pain relief with a cannabis bath soak, cannabidiol (CBD) and beeswax-infused body balm and organic and raw cocoa infused with either THC or CBD. Although the bill has a few more steps to go before women could potentially be prescribed medical marijuana for cramps in New York, Rosenthal said the high support so far for the measure is a good sign it could pass into legislation. “I think we’re a progressive state. It did take 20 years to get medical marijuana to be the law,” she said,” but we’re going to work hard to get it passed.” “And I’m sure many women will vouch for what they have to go through each month.” ||||| Dysmenorrhea may begin soon after menarche, where it often improves with age, or it may originate later in life after the onset of an underlying causative condition. Dysmenorrhea is very common, and it may be severe enough to interfere with daily activities in up to 20 percent of women. Dysmenorrhea is more likely in women who smoke, and in women with an earlier age at menarche or longer duration of menstruation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce moderate to severe pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea compared with placebo, but we do not know whether any one nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is superior to the others. Simple analgesics such as aspirin and paracetamol may reduce pain in the short term, although few studies have been of good quality. The Chinese herbal remedy toki-shakuyaku-san and an Iranian herbal remedy made from saffron, celery, and anise may reduce pain compared with placebo. We do not know whether Chinese herbal remedies are beneficial compared with placebo, but there is limited evidence that they may be effective compared with other treatments for dysmenorrhea. Thiamine and vitamin E may reduce pain compared with placebo in young women with primary dysmenorrhea. Combined oral contraceptives may be more effective at reducing pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea; however, few studies have been of good quality. Topical heat (about 102°F [39°C]) may be as effective as ibuprofen and more effective than paracetamol at reducing pain. High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may reduce pain compared with sham treatment, but seems to be less effective than ibuprofen. Acupressure may be more effective than sham or no treatment at relieving dysmenorrhea. Spinal manipulation may be no more effective than placebo at reducing pain after one month in women with primary dysmenorrhea. Relaxation may be better than no treatment at relieving dysmenorrhea. We do not know whether acupuncture, fish oil, vitamin B 12 , magnets, or intrauterine progestogens reduce dysmenorrhea. Surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways is not beneficial in treating dysmenorrhea, and may be associated with adverse effects including constipation.

It is commonly divided into primary dysmenorrhea (pain without organic pathology) and secondary dysmenorrhea (pelvic pain associated with an identifiable pathologic condition, such as endometriosis or ovarian cysts). The initial onset of primary dysmenorrhea usually occurs within six to 12 months after menarche, when ovulatory cycles are established. Pain duration is commonly eight to 72 hours and is usually associated with the onset of menstrual flow. Secondary dysmenorrhea can also occur at any time after menarche, but may arise as a new symptom during a woman's fourth and fifth decades, after the onset of an underlying causative condition. In this review we only consider studies of women with primary dysmenorrhea. However, the results may also be generalizable to women with secondary dysmenorrhea. Studies of women with endometriosis, adenomyosis, pelvic congestion, and fibroids may also examine dysmenorrhea/pain as an outcome. Incidence and Prevalence Variations in the definition of dysmenorrhea make it difficult to determine precise prevalence rates. Studies tend to report on prevalence in adolescent girls, and the type of dysmenorrhea is not always specified. Adolescent girls tend to have a higher prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea than older women, because primary dysmenorrhea can improve with age (see Prognosis). Secondary dysmenorrhea rates may be lower in adolescents, because onset of causative conditions may not yet have occurred. Therefore, the results from prevalence studies of adolescents may not always be extrapolated to older women, or be accurate estimates of the prevalence of secondary dysmenorrhea. However, various types of studies have found a consistently high prevalence in women of different ages and nationalities. One systematic review (search date 1996) of the prevalence of chronic pelvic pain, summarizing community and hospital surveys from developed countries, estimated prevalence to be 45 to 95 percent. A second systematic review of studies in developing countries (search date 2002) found that 25 to 50 percent of adult women, and about 75 percent of adolescents, experienced pain with menstruation, with 5 to 20 percent reporting severe dysmenorrhea or pain that prevents them from participating in their usual activities. A third systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence rates among high-quality studies with samples representative of the general worldwide population (search date 2004) found that prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 59 percent (95% confidence interval, 49 to 71 percent). Prevalence rates reported in the United Kingdom were between 45 and 97 percent for any dysmenorrhea in community-based studies, and between 41 and 62 percent in hospital-based studies. Etiology and Risk Factors A systematic review (search date 2004) of cohort and case-control studies concluded that age younger than 30 years, low body mass index, smoking, earlier menarche (younger than 12 years), longer menstrual cycles, heavy menstrual flow, nulliparity, premenstrual syndrome, sterilization, clinically suspected pelvic inflammatory disease, sexual abuse, and psychological symptoms were associated with increased risk of dysmenorrhea. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

My gas tank was pushing 'E' but fortunately the service station was open. When I stepped out of my Jeep, I could feel the soles of my boots melt on the asphalt. The heat coming off the cracked and pitted cement peeled off in waves that rolled out in every endless direction.

Danny Cevallos: Arrests over tweets threatening NYPD raise issue of when speech is threat. He says Supreme Court to weigh in soon. Maybe it's time to draw threat line at social media. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: When Does Speech Become a Threat? Supreme Court to Weigh in on Social Media's Role Introduction In today's digital age, social media has become an essential platform for expression and free speech, granting individuals the ability to voice their thoughts and opinions with ease. However, the growing trend of arrests over threatening tweets directed at the New York Police Department raises questions about the boundary between protected speech and criminal threats. Legal analyst Danny Cevallos observes that the Supreme Court's upcoming involvement in clarifying this line might redefine the way we perceive threats within social media spaces. Arrests Over Threatening Tweets Over recent years, there have been multiple instances of individuals being arrested for posting threatening messages on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, targeting the NYPD. For many, these cases evoke questions about whether such arrests infringe upon First Amendment rights to free speech. A delicate balance must exist between protecting individuals' rights to freedom of expression and ensuring public safety against credible threats, especially in evolving digital environments. The Supreme Court Weighs In To address this legal conundrum, the Supreme Court has decided to weigh in on the issue, providing much-needed clarity on the distinction between protected speech and criminal threats in the context of social media. The Court's decision will be crucial in defining the parameters within which threats on social media will be viewed as punishable offenses under U.S. law. This judgment has the potential to act as a legal precedent for future cases involving threats made through digital communication platforms. Drawing the 'Threat Line' on Social Media The imminent Supreme Court decision highlights the importance of establishing a defined 'threat line' on social media platforms. By doing so, legal systems can better account for the intricacies of online communication, ensuring that First Amendment rights are duly safeguarded while simultaneously upholding necessary protection against dangerous threats. The outcome of the Supreme Court's involvement will not only impact the American legal landscape but may also influence the strategies implemented by social media companies in regulating harmful content. Conclusion As the boundaries of human communication blur with the advancements of digital technology, the clarity on the distinction between free speech and threats has become essential to uphold individual liberties and maintain public safety. The Supreme Court's decision on the matter will offer much-needed guidance on navigating this gray area within the realm of social media. By adequately delineating the line between protected speech and punishable threats, the Court's intervention has the potential to shape the way in which authorities and social media platforms approach and manage threatening content online. In this rapidly evolving digital era, it is crucial to strike a fair balance between ensuring the protection of fundamental rights while mitigating the potential harm that may arise from dangerous threats made within virtual spaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there appear to be many \\"inaccuracies and contradictions\\" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £3 million as of 2019) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£13,000 as of 2019), and that £400 (£53,000 as of 2019) was to be allocated for funeral expenses.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"The Republicans have held the 1st congressional district for how long?\\" is in \\"In the early 21st century, Republican voters control most of the state, especially in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities, and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis. The latter area includes a large African-American population. Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s. Tennessee's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South. Those districts' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War; they identified with the GOP after the war and have stayed with that party ever since. The 1st has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881, and Republicans (or their antecedents) have held it for all but four years since 1859.

Smell nice by keeping yourself and your clothes clean, but also consider adding a perfume or cologne to your fashion line-up. Avoid young scents like fruity smells in favor of something more mature for a really classy touch. Keep your clothes in a theme in order give yourself a signature style. This is a look that people will associate with you and will make you seem more stylish, even if they don’t necessarily like your clothes. The style you create for yourself should generally match who you are as a person. For example, a really sweet woman taking on a catty look will seem weird and out of place, the same as a serious businessman dressing in gangsta style. Tailor your clothes to fit your personality and people will be much more inclined to see it as your style. Do you ever feel like some models could wear a brown paper sack and still walk down a runway looking like the height of fashion? Do you know a guy who wears a tracksuit and still somehow manages to look totally fashionable? What the fashion industry doesn’t want you to know is that a lot of looking stylish really comes down to projecting confidence. You don’t have to actually be confident, of course, but if you walk down the street in clothes that you clearly think you look great in, people will usually be inclined to agree that (at a minimum) those clothes are perfect for you. The effortless part of the stylish look should of course be presented by giving off an air that you don’t care, or that you just threw on the first outfit you could find. Be humble or indifferent when people compliment your clothes. In order to look stylish, you’re also going to want to look elegant and coordinated. This means not falling down if you’re wearing heels. Being graceful should be easier for guys, but is still important so don’t neglect it. Even if you’re wearing 4” stilettos, you need to look like it’s all perfectly natural and you’re perfectly comfortable. Don’t complain and constantly readjust your clothes. If that style isn’t working out for you, if you can’t seem casual in it, then try something that’s actually more comfortable. You can be comfortable and stylish. Again, effortless style is all about looking awesome while also looking like you didn’t try at all. Effortless, right? So relax. Take a generally chill attitude to everything in life. Always stay calm and happy, and you’ll look much better, no matter what you’re wearing. Summary:","completion":"Scent and personal style contribute significantly to how people perceive you. To create a positive perception, maintain cleanliness, choose mature scents, and develop a signature clothing style that reflects your personality. Projecting confidence in your appearance, even if you're not confident, makes others perceive your clothing as stylish. Aim for an effortless look and don't fuss over your clothes, prioritizing comfort while maintaining elegance and coordination. Adopt a relaxed attitude in life, which will enhance your appearance regardless of your outfit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of putting a half ponytail in your hair, follow these step-by-step instructions. Each step is justified to ensure a proper and secure half ponytail. 1. Comb/Brush your hair - Begin by combing or brushing your hair to remove any tangles. This ensures a smooth foundation for your half ponytail. 2. Section the hair - Select the top half portion of your hair by running your thumbs from the top of your ears towards the back of your head. Having a clear section ensures a neat and structured half ponytail. 3. Secure the ponytail - Gather the hair from the top half section, and hold it firmly with one hand. Use the other hand to grasp a hair tie. Make sure the hair tie is sturdy and clean, as this will secure the half ponytail in place. Loop the hair tie around the base of the half ponytail until it feels snug but not too tight. A secure ponytail is essential for maintaining the style throughout the day. 4. Adjust the position - Check the position of the half ponytail and adjust it accordingly. You can place it higher or lower on the back of your head depending on your preference. Experiment with different positions to find the one that flatters your face shape and matches your desired style. 5. Smooth the hair - Use a comb or brush to smooth the hair around the half ponytail, as well as the hair in the ponytail itself. This step ensures a polished appearance and helps prevent any loose strands. 6. Optional: secure with bobby pins - If you have shorter layers or flyaways, use bobby pins to secure them in place. This will prevent any stray hairs from detracting from the overall look of your half ponytail. 7. Optional: customize your style - Add accessories, such as a bow or decorative hairpin, to personalize your half ponytail. These small details can transform the style and make it your own. By following these steps, you can easily achieve a half ponytail that is well-structured, secure, and stylish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A battle-hardened Huntley-Brinkley reporter later said that no military action he had witnessed had ever frightened or disturbed him as much as what he saw in Birmingham. Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had previously worked with the Montgomery Advertiser and was now working for Life magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press. Moore was a Marine combat photographer who was \\"jarred\\" and \\"sickened\\" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them. Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life.

A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography. The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima.

Nicknamed \\"The General\\", Knight won 902 NCAA Division I men's college basketball games, the most all-time at the time of his retirement and currently third all-time, behind his former player and assistant coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University, and Jim Boeheim of Syracuse University. Knight is best known as the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers from 1971 to 2000. On March 14, 2000 (just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament), the CNN Sports Illustrated network ran a piece on Knight in which former player Neil Reed claimed he had been choked by Knight during a 1997 practice. Knight denied the claims in the story. However, less than a month later, the network aired a tape of an Indiana practice from 1997 that appeared to show Knight placing his hand on the neck of Reed. In response, Indiana University president Myles Brand announced that he had adopted a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy with regard to Knight's behavior. Later in the year, in September 2000, Indiana freshman Kent Harvey reportedly said, \\"Hey, Knight, what's up?\\" to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him by the arm and lectured him for not showing him respect, insisting that Harvey address him as either \\"Mr. Knight\\" or \\"Coach Knight\\" instead of simply \\"Knight.\\" Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been put into place. Brand asked Knight to resign on September 10, and when Knight refused, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning Brand in effigy. Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he had intentionally set up Knight. Kent Harvey's stepfather, Mark Shaw, was a former Bloomington-area radio talk show host and Knight critic. On September 13, Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters in Dunn Meadow at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they continue to support the basketball team. Knight's firing made national headlines, including the cover of Sports Illustrated and around the clock coverage on ESPN.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did this do for him","completion":"Robert Montgomery Knight, also known as \\"The General,\\" is a famous retired basketball coach.

Because of this, the president of Indiana University, Myles Brand, said Coach Knight had to behave very well from then on. In 2000, a student named Kent Harvey said \\"Hey, Knight, what's up?\\" to Coach Knight, but Coach Knight thought that was disrespectful. He wanted to be called \\"Mr. Knight\\" or \\"Coach Knight.\\" This led to Myles Brand asking Coach Knight to leave his job, and when he didn't, Coach Knight was fired.

The Ozarks in Missouri, and the more massive and younger Colorado Rockies. He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more. Which rocks are less soluble, the ones from the Ozarks, or the ones from the Rockies? Hint: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the rocks in the Ozarks are more soluble than the ones in the Colorado Rockies. This is because the Ozark region is known for its abundant limestone formations and the presence of cave systems and blue holes, which are a result of the solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that dissolves relatively easily in water and weak acids, leading to the formation of karst landscapes characterized by caves, sinkholes, and underground drainage systems. About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones, and since the Ozarks feature extensive cave systems and blue holes, it is safe to assume that a significant portion of their geological makeup consists of limestone. In contrast, the Colorado Rockies are a younger and more massive mountain range, primarily composed of granite, gneiss, and other igneous and metamorphic rocks. These types of rocks are more resistant to erosion and are less soluble than limestone found in the Ozarks. In summary, the rocks in the Ozarks, which are largely composed of limestone, are more soluble than those found in the Colorado Rockies, which consist predominantly of tougher igneous and metamorphic rocks. This difference in solubility contributes to the unique geologic features, such as caves and blue holes, that Peter enjoyed in the Ozarks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Note that this question lists possible answers. Which person is they referring to in the following sentence? The government officials publicly apologized to the people because they demanded an apology. OPT: - The government officials; - the people;","completion":"In the sentence \\"The government officials publicly apologized to the people because they demanded an apology,\\" the pronoun \\"they\\" is most likely referring to \\"the people.\\" The sentence expresses that the government officials made a public apology, and the reason for this apology is because someone demanded it. From the given context, \\"the people\\" are the only other group mentioned who could have made this demand. Therefore, we can safely deduce that the pronoun \\"they\\" must be referring to \\"the people\\" in this instance. Considering both options: 1. The government officials: If \\"they\\" referred to the government officials, the sentence would imply that the government officials demanded an apology from themselves, which is less likely and might not make much sense contextually. 2. The people: The sentence appears to convey that the government officials owe the people an apology due to some transgression or mistake, and the people are demanding that the officials acknowledge and apologize for the situation. This interpretation is more logical and probable within the given context. So, after examining both possibilities, it seems reasonable to conclude that \\"they\\" is referring to \\"the people\\" in the sentence. This interpretation is supported by the context and implies a more coherent and likely explanation - that the people demanded an apology, and the government officials acted accordingly by offering a public apology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In ancient times, its quarries yielded countless stones for the famous temples in Thebes and along the River Nile; up to 3,000 men were working here. Your journey to Gebel El Silsila will be an eye-opening experience as you explore this historically significant site in Egypt. This location is situated on both banks of the River Nile, approximately 65 kilometers north of Aswan and was once known as \\"The Land of Gold\\" for its wealth in resources and materials. As an integral part of ancient Egyptian history, Gebel El Silsila was home to several quarries that provided vital stone materials used for constructing majestic temples, statues, and monuments in Thebes and other cities along the Nile. The quarries in Gebel El Silsila produced stones of various types, including sandstone and limestone, which were essential for the creation of some of ancient Egypt's most recognizable structures. Among these were the Luxor Temple, Karnak Temple, and the many colossal statues that shaped the landscape of the region. During its peak, these quarries put nearly 3,000 men to work, handling everything from extracting the materials to loading them onto boats for transport along the Nile River. These laborers formed an intricate web of skilled craftsmen, including stonecutters, carvers, masons, and engineers. Their knowledge and abilities enabled them to create some of the most enduring landmarks in history. Not only was Gebel El Silsila a crucial supplier of resources to the ancient Egyptians, but the site also holds immense religious significance. Many temples were built within the area itself, serving as places of worship and spiritual retreat for the thousands of workers employed in the quarries. Along the cliffs and within the quarries, you will find numerous rock-cut shrines and stelae dedicated to various deities and ruling pharaohs, providing valuable insights into the religious practices and beliefs of the time. Among the most impressive sights in Gebel El Silsila are the Speos of Horemheb, a rock-cut temple built by the pharaoh Horemheb during the New Kingdom (18th Dynasty), and the Chapel of Seti I, which features well-preserved inscriptions and relief carvings. Moreover, numerous inscriptions and graffiti left by the quarry workers paint a vivid picture of their daily lives and offer a unique perspective on the inner workings of ancient Egyptian society. As you sail to Gebel El Silsila, prepare to be captivated by the marvels of ancient architecture, engineering, and craftsmanship displayed throughout these historic quarries. As you explore the temples, shrines, and stelae hidden within the landscape, you will gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the efforts and ingenuity that contributed to the prosperity and grandeur of ancient Egypt."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since I completed two credits in one class I have a spare in Grade 11. The spare is in the afternoon, my school as a day 1 (odd days) and a day 2 (even days) so one week my spare would be period 4 (last period) on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This week it is Tuesday and Thursday. For the other afternoon period I have Online Accounting. The Library (where I usually work on the computers provided) was double booked which means no computers are free. I usually find another spot with a singular computer like the Guidance Office. The past 2 days (including today) it is double booked during my account online class. So I went to the Guidance Office to ask if I could use the computers next period, but also asked if I was allowed to \\"swap\\" the time slots for the online class and spare from time to time when the library is booked. She said since I could access the online class at any time of the day and there is no time slot for it I could. I asked if it'd be unethical to swap the two all the time when I had accounting class period to get off school early. She said no since I can acccess accounting any time and the other period isn't a class, but instead a free period. **So...** WIBTA if I swapped the time slots to be in my control to leave at 1:20 compared to 2:35 leaving my friend (who I mainly on see at the end of school for the walk home) in the dust every day to well get off early, and is abusing my powers unethical?

Problem: Solve -42*l = -38*l + 115*l - 1904 for l. And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the given equation -42*l = -38*l + 115*l - 1904 for l, we should combine like terms and isolate l on one side of the equation. Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. First, combine the l terms on the right side of the equation: -42*l = (-38*l + 115*l) - 1904 -42*l = 77*l - 1904, since (-38 + 115 = 77) 2. Next, we want to get all the l terms on one side of the equation. We can do that by adding 42*l to both sides: -42*l + 42*l = 77*l - 1904 + 42*l 0 = 119*l - 1904, since (77 + 42 = 119) 3. Now, isolate l by adding 1904 to both sides of the equation: 1904 = 119*l 4. Lastly, to find the value of l, divide both sides by 119: l = 1904 / 119 l ≈ 16, since (1904 / 119 ≈ 16) So, the answer is: l ≈ 16."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence. Indeed, both sentences essentially state the same thing but are expressed in different linguistic styles. The first sentence is expressed in a dialectical manner, possibly reflecting a certain regional vernacular or a particular character's speech in a story. It uses a variety of non-standard English expressions and phrasings, such as \\"siree,\\" \\"th'\\" for 'the,' \\"havin'\\" for 'having,' \\"a sight of\\" for 'a lot of,' and \\"gunpowder\\" as a likely colloquialism for ammo or bullets. On the other hand, the second sentence is expressed in formal, standard English. It translates the meaning of the first sentence into more universally recognized English. \\"This is the 2nd time we've made it through this place without having to shoot anything\\" communicates the same message as the first sentence—namely, that the speaker and possibly a group have managed to traverse a certain area twice without needing to resort to using their weaponry. So, overall, both sentences share the same message, but they express it in different styles of speech.

Given those answer options, answer the question: One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa’s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display. Bringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask—and answer—several questions about it. Who—if anyone—does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history. In its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object’s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation. In early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display. After the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a...

The only activities her children should be permitted to do are those in which they can eventually win a medal, which must be gold. What kind of a mother she is? Why, a mother who is raising her kids in the typical Chinese way, rather than the Western way. In her new book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, Chua tells her adventures in Chinese parenting, and -- so _ as she may be -- she is also mesmerizing .

They're written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, another two scientists found the first \\"word\\" that they could understand in that language. It shows how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. So far, scientists have found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \\"word\\" means, we can help to save people from several illnesses. So the more we understand, the more doctors will be able to do. Most people hope that this will help to make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when we learn more \\"words\\" and and find out more information, we will use it in the wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people getting jobs.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less ground water available happens, how will it affect less evaporating water is collected in the process. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If there is less groundwater available, this may lead to a decrease in the amount of water that can be processed through this method. The decrease in available water will directly affect the efficiency and output of the process, as there will be less water evaporating and condensing. The perturbation of reduced groundwater availability can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effects: With less water being processed, there will be less evaporated water collected and less salt removed from the water during each iteration of the process. Indirect effects: The reduced availability of water might lead to adjustments in the process parameters, such as finding alternative water sources or investing in more advanced technologies to increase the evaporation efficiency and salt removal. Additionally, it can prompt the community and policymakers to address the issue of groundwater scarcity and implement conservation measures to ensure the sustainability of the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These problems contribute to the lack of a rigorous definition of matter in science, although mass is easier to define as the total stress–energy above (this is also what is weighed on a scale, and what is the source of gravity).[citation needed] Mass is harder to define as being what? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Okay, let me explain this like you're five years old. The text talks about some things in science that are really tiny, like tiny particles and tiny waves of light. These tiny things can sometimes have mass, which is like how heavy or light they are. They also have energy, which helps them move around and do different things. But sometimes, it's hard for scientists to say if these tiny things are actually \\"matter\\" or just energy moving around. One reason is that some of these tiny things don't have mass, so they don't exactly fit the usual idea of what counts as \\"matter\\". When you try to weigh them, it gets confusing, because you're measuring not just how heavy they are, but also the energy they have. So, the text is saying that it's harder to define exactly what \\"matter\\" is, but it's a bit easier to define something called \\"mass\\", which is like how heavy or light they are.

Magomed Abdusalamov, 32, suffered a stroke and languished in a coma for several weeks after his vicious November 2 fight against Cuba's Mike Perez at Madison Square Garden. He is now bedridden with fears he may never walk or talk again. Now the fighter’s devastated wife Bakanay Abdusalamova plans to sue the state of New York and its athletic commission, alleging negligence and medical malpractice. She claimed in court papers filed yesterday that officials allowed her husband to be 'violently beaten, bludgeoned, punched and pummeled by his opponent without proper, timely or adequate recognition, termination and or/rescue.' Court action: The family of Russian heavyweight boxer Magomed Abdusalamov, 32 (pictured) who was beaten into a coma in a November 2 bout has filed a 100¿million lawsuit. Brutal: Magomed Abdusalamov (right) lost a bloody bout to Cuba's Mike Perez on November 2 and also broke his hand and nose. Abdusalamova is seeking 1 million is damages for loss of parental guidance and economic loss as a result of her husband's condition. The couple's three daughters, Patimat, Shakhrizat and Saygibat, are listed as claimants along with their mother. The Dagestan native suffered a broken. nose and hand in the first round and was visibly disfigured by the fifth. round. In the seventh round, two ringside doctors inspected Abdusalamov but. cleared him to continue. Although Perez nearly knocked then 'Russian Tyson' down in the final round, the referee and his own trainer let. him finish the 10-round fight. The court papers say Abdusalamov, who absorbed 312 punches, was advised by state officials to go to a hospital when he urinated blood after the fight, but an ambulance was not provided. The severely injured boxer and his frightened family were forced to find a cab outside the entertainment venue during rush hour, the court papers say. 'They should have stopped the fight,' the fighter's cousin, Amin Suleymanov, told The New York Post. 'Everybody could see that.'

Devastated: Abdusalamov's wife Bakanay (left) and brother Abdusalam (right) said the 32-year-old dad was a devoted family man. The Wall Street Journal reported Abdusalamov sustained a blood clot on his brain during the fight. The clot was discovered after he went to Roosevelt Hospital to be treated for nose and hand injuries. Doctors operated on his brain to remove the clot, then placed him in a medically induced coma to help ease the swelling in his brain. Abdusalamov suffered a stroke shortly after. He remained in a coma for several weeks, only awakening once briefly. Now, according to ESPN, he is in a rehabilitation facility and can move only slightly.

Summarize this article: As long as you keep up with your payment plan as spelled out in your promissory note, you are on track to successfully repaying your loan. Even if you are able to meet the payments without difficulties, you and the lender might prefer to put a buffer up so that you are not the ones handling the payments directly. Consider hiring a loan manager to deal with the payments and send any reminder notices, annual reports, and other documents. Having an outside person dealing with the everyday administration of the loan can help you have a more normal relationship with the borrower. A major factor in a successful private loan is your ability to maintain clear communication and honest transparency with the lender. The lender should make herself available to talk, and hear you out if you have run into temporary financial difficulty. The borrower has a responsibility to be direct and honest with the lender from the start and throughout. If you are anticipating having problems making a payment, speak to the lender as soon as possible and be prepared to offer a sensible alternative. You might like to set up regular meetings or conversations so you can both keep track of the loan. This gives you a formal forum to discuss any issues and work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. If you run into financial difficulty, and are struggling to make the payments, you should be prepared to work hard to make accommodations which ensure the borrower gets repaid. Treat the loan as you would a loan from a bank, and work with the lender to come up with an alternative payment schedule. This could mean increasing the duration of the loan from ten to fifteen years, or altering the repayment schedule so a greater proportion of the loan is paid off in later years. Remember that you have to make an offer that benefits the lender as well. If you’re asking for a significant extension to the duration of the loan, be prepared to marginally increase the rate of interest. A big part of treating the loan as a professional agreement is keeping it isolated from your day-to-day interactions. Try to avoid talking about the loan at family occasions or when socialising. Keep it something you discuss at specific times, and try to contain it. This will be a lot easier if all the agreements are clear, and everybody is sticking to them. Summary:","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clear and transparent line of communication between the lender and the borrower throughout the term of a loan. It suggests that hiring a loan manager could ease the process of payment, reminders, and reports, while preserving the relationship between the two parties. The article also recommends being proactive in case of anticipated financial issues that could affect the payments. Regular meetings could be set up to review the loan progress and negotiate mutually beneficial solutions for repayment. In case of financial difficulties, borrowers are encouraged to consider possible alterations to the repayment schedule while ensuring that it remains fair to the lender. Avoiding discussion of the loan outside of specific settings can help isolate it from day-to-day interactions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Wills Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 04:56 EST, 4 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:52 EST, 4 November 2013. For fifty years, farmer Doug Goulbourne lived without running water. From the age of 21, he was forced to take a bucket back and forth to a tatttered water pump at Widow Croft Farm in Hollingworth, Greater Manchester, just so he could have a bath or pour himself a glass of water. But now, the 72-year-old has been connected to a water mains for the very first time, and celebrated by turning the tap, filling his kettle and making a cup of tea. Into the 21st century: Doug Goulbourne, 72, can now make himself a glass of water without having to walk to a water pump after almost 50 years without running water. Daily routine: He would have to take a bucket to the tattered pump if he ever wanted water. The farmer has been going back and forth to a tattered water pump in a ditch 50 yards away since his parents moved to the property in 1962. Now, after having to rescue unlucky frogs from the 166-year-old contraption at the break of dawn he can enjoy quality H20 around the clock. 'I'm delighted,' said Mr Goulbourne,. who kept his bath full with water while the workmen from United Utilities dug around his. 84-acre farm just in case the supply ran out. 'Having. running water makes my life so much easier now. It's fantastic just. knowing when I turn on the tap - water is going to come out. Work: Mr Goulbounre, pictured working in the dairy, moved to the farm in 1962 when he was 21-years-old. Property: The pump used on the farm in Hollingworth, Greater Manchester, was installed 166 years ago. Tough: The farmer has suffered many winters without any water at all, but can now enjoy H20 around the clock. 'It's a real pain having to thaw out your water supply every winter or worry about it drying up in the summer. I think it's marvellous now I have a mains supply and they say it is better water too.' Bachelor Mr Goulbourne inherited. Widows Croft Farm, built in 1837, from his father in the late 1960s. but he was happy to carry on using the well - which involved taking. water from a tank filled by gravity from water streams. He would wake up at 5.30am each day and get the water after he tended to his animals, including a pet cow called Susan, 60 cattle and four dogs. But. times were difficult when his rickety water pump, which channels water. from moorland streams, failed and he was left with no other. option but to fix it time and time again. Finally: He is now able to make a cup of tea by simply turning the tap and filling his kettle. Early rise: He would get the water after waking up at 5.30am each day to tend to his animals, which includes a cow called Susan, 60 cattle and four dogs. Despite the monotonous routine, he never thought about getting running water installed until the offer arrived. Under a new Â£3m scheme, United. Utilities have extended their water network to more remote parts of the. valley where the farmer lives, so supplies will be piped to him and more than. 30 other properties in the area. 'Having a well and no running water was like having a wooden leg,' said Mr Goulburne, who has not owned a working television for 14 years and builds. radios to communicate via Morse code with enthusiasts as far afield as. Spain and Croatia. Handed down: Bachelor Mr Goulbourne inherited Widows Croft Farm from his father in the late 1960s. 'If you've got one, you make do with it and carry on. The tank could pack up at any time and there would be no water to draw and I just to go without. 'It used to always seem to pack up on. Christmas Eve or Christmas morning. But when you're used to using. something you just carry on, it doesn't occur to you to change.' 'Now. it's going to make a tremendous difference. Some days I don't have the. energy I used to have. It's going to give me so much more time - I'll. feel ten years younger. 'It's. going to be lovely to have clean, clear water because there was a lot. of pollution in the other one. In spring I would get little frogs stuck. in the pump and I would have to pull them out. Now. the best thing is the water is just there. I don't have any problems. now. Now if I do have a problem I just ring the company up and they sort. it out. 'Some people. say, 'how can you live like that?' and I say 'well how do you think. people looked after themselves 1,000 years ago?' That's where people got. water from.' Content: Despite the monotonous routine, the farmer did not think about being connected to a water supply until he was offered one. He added: 'We are so lucky in this country having beautiful clean water. We should appreciate it more. But I'm tremendously grateful for what's happened. I have spent quite a lot of time this year messing about with the pump. 'Usually I have enough water to last through winter but this year I didn't have enough. It's run out through winter before and you just have to fix it.' Graham Dent, the United Utilities project co-ordinator said: 'It seems ironic that these properties are so close to our reservoir and yet they don't have mains water. 'We're going to put that right and there will be a lot of activity this autumn as we lay the new pipes. We've planned the work outside peak times and we are keeping the pipeline away from major highways as much as possible.' In 2010, only 30,021 out of more than 21 million households in England and Wales were not connected to the mains supply. Water began being pumped to British houses in the middle of the 19th century after people had previously relied on rivers and wells for their water.

He is criticized constantly by other photographers for fleeing danger before shooting a full reel. One night, in a decision to break this trend, he saves a woman from a gang that is abusing her. The next day, he discovers this girl has gone missing. Leon is intrigued by the mystery, and begins to investigate newsreels about similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany, who he suspects has been killing subway passengers for as long as a hundred years.Leon attempts to turn some of the photos he has taken of Mahogany in to the police, but they refuse to believe him, and instead cast suspicion on his own motives in photographing the victims. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his waitress girlfriend Maya, who is as disbelieving of his story as the police chief. Leon takes matters into his own hands, entering the subway train at midnight, only to witness a shocking bloodbath, as the butcher kills several passengers, then hangs them on meat hooks.

By Mark Wilson For The Daily Mail For Ally McCoist, a brief period when football dominated the agenda at Rangers came to an abrupt halt on Friday. Two hours before the Ibrox manager conducted a 9am press briefing at Murray Park, a statement to the Stock Exchange spelled out the precarious financial position at the club. The launch of a new share issue is intended to raise £4million to provide a stop-gap injection of funds. An uptake of at least £3m is required for it to go ahead. Concern: Ally McCoist is worried about the club's perilous finances and the prospect of administration Having bubbled away in the background while the fluctuating form of McCoist’s team drew attention, monetary worries are once again front and centre at","completion":"Ibrox. The urgency of the situation is evident, with the club on the precipice of financial disaster. The £4 million share issue initiative represents a last-ditch effort to create a temporary financial reprieve for the beleaguered institution. Club insiders and fans alike have voiced their increasing anxiety about the administration's handling of the finances, and the seemingly endless cycle of mismanagement that has plagued Rangers for years. As the prospect of administration looms over the heads of players, staff, and fans, there is an undeniable fear that the very identity and future of the club are at stake. The heavy burden of responsibility weighs not only on McCoist, who has managed the team through thick and thin, but also on the board members and executives who have allowed the situation to escalate to its current state. McCoist's concerns are shared by players and personnel at the club, with many feeling that the proposed share issue is merely a band-aid solution that won't address the deeper, long-term structural issues facing the organization. Amidst concerns about the club's ability to attract new investors, the £3 million minimum uptake required for the share issue to proceed seems like a tall order. In the event that the fundraising effort falls short, it's almost certain that Rangers will be forced into administration once again, with all the negative repercussions that such a scenario would entail. The club's precarious financial situation is undoubtedly affecting its sporting performance, as McCoist's team struggles to maintain consistency on the field. The persistent air of uncertainty, combined with the incessant waves of bad financial news, can't be conducive to a focused and stable team environment. Despite the various challenges that the squad is facing, McCoist continues to prioritize football and to work tirelessly to ensure his team's performance remains competitive. However, the 9am press briefing and the unforeseen announcement of the club's dire financial status serve as grim reminders that, ultimately, a strong financial foundation is crucial for the long-term health of the organization. As the Ibrox outfit awaits the outcome of the share issue, myriad questions remain unanswered. How has the club reached a position where a mere £4 million injection of funds is seen as a lifeline? Are the current executives and board members capable of leading the club out of this quagmire? And, most importantly, will the supporters – the lifeblood of the entire enterprise – continue to back a club that has dashed their hopes and dreams time and again? For now, all eyes are on the share issue's success or failure. The results will determine whether Rangers will be given a stay of execution or plunged, once more, into the abyss of administration. Both McCoist and the fans are holding their breath, hoping against hope that the club they love can somehow find a way to turn a corner and begin the long, arduous journey back to stability and success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pick from: * yes; * no;","completion":"Yes, the statement made by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their book, The Grand Design, is a good answer to the question of whether questions of God's existence are similar to questions in natural science. They suggest that it is reasonable to inquire about the creation of the universe. However, if the answer given is God, the question then becomes who or what created God, leading to a similar line of inquiry as in natural science. The comparison to natural science is significant, as it highlights the importance of seeking evidence-based, testable explanations for the phenomena we observe. The scientific method demands that hypotheses should be based on empirical evidence, and it seeks to develop explanations that are consistent with observations, repeatable through experimentation, and falsifiable if new data contradicts the existing hypothesis. In the case of questions involving God, many might argue that these inquiries differ from those in natural science because they involve matters of faith, rather than evidence-based investigation. However, the perspective provided by Hawking and Mlodinow suggests that the questions share similarities with natural science in that they both address matters of causality, origin, and the nature of existence. The authors' approach to the question of God's existence also highlights the potential for an infinite regression of explanatory causes. If God created the universe, who or what created God? And who or what created that creator, and so on, ad infinitum? This idea is not confined to religious debate, as similar questions have arisen in the context of cosmology, which examines the origins and development of the universe. For instance, the Big Bang Theory posits that the universe began with an explosive expansion from an extremely condensed and hot state, approximately 13.8 billion years ago. However, when considering what led to the Big Bang, we may ask what caused the conditions necessary for that event to take place, initiating yet another line of inquiry into what preceded it. In conclusion, the statement by Hawking and Mlodinow is a good answer to the question at hand, as it illustrates the similarities between questions about God's existence and those posed in natural science when considering matters of causality and origin. The authors emphasize that when examining any type of question relating to the creation or origin of existence, it is essential to approach them using evidence-based and testable methods, while always being prepared for further inquiry as new knowledge and understanding develops."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plugging the known values into the formula: d = 1/2 * 9.81 m/s^2 * (2 s)^2 d = 1/2 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 4 s^2 d = 0.5 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 4 s^2 Calculating the distance: d = 0.5 * 39.24 m d = 19.62 meters So, in 2 seconds, you would fall approximately 19.62 meters, assuming there is no air resistance and you are close to the Earth's surface where the acceleration due to gravity is nearly constant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - dog show - manhattan apartment - tree - farm - neighbor's yard I believe the correct choice is \\"manhattan apartment\\", here's why: A:","completion":"If someone is only able to have a small dog, there could be various reasons behind this limitation, such as living in a confined space, having restrictions imposed by the landlord or the housing society, or simply a personal preference. Out of the options provided, the most suitable choice for someone in this situation would be a Manhattan apartment. Here's why: 1. Limited space: Manhattan apartments are known for their relatively smaller size, especially when compared to house properties. Most of these apartments don't have the luxury of a large backyard or a spacious lawn, which makes it challenging to accommodate a big dog that requires ample space to run and play. On the other hand, small dog breeds typically adapt well to smaller spaces and can live comfortably in an apartment setting. 2. Housing and lease restrictions: Many apartment buildings, particularly in urban areas like Manhattan, may enforce strict rules and regulations when it comes to pet ownership. A building may restrict the size, weight, or breed of dogs allowed as pets for residents. In such cases, having a small dog would be a more practical choice, as they are more likely to comply with these restrictions. 3. Living among neighbors: Apartments are usually part of a larger community, and in places like Manhattan where social interaction is a common occurrence, having pets that are easy to manage, less aggressive, and have a lower potential for causing disturbances, is certainly a better choice. Small dogs tend to fit this bill and are generally more accepted by neighbors than larger, more boisterous dogs. 4. Easier maintenance: With busy city lives and limited available time, having a small dog can also be easier to manage in terms of grooming, training, and daily care. In an apartment setting, taking care of a smaller pet is more convenient as they require less space for their living, sleeping, and feeding areas. 5. Access to city amenities: Manhattan is known for its vast array of amenities, including dog-friendly parks and pet services. Many of these spaces and services are designed with small dogs in mind, catering to the needs of urban dwellers and their pets. Living in a Manhattan apartment provides easy access to these resources, making it an ideal location for someone with a small dog. In conclusion, a Manhattan apartment appears to be the best option among the choices provided for someone who is only able to have a small dog. This living arrangement not only accommodates the practicalities of caring for a small dog but also provides the necessary resources for a pet owner in an urban setting to ensure a healthy and fulfilling life for their furry companion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George. George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up alone in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. George gets up and while watching Kenny discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, taken from the desktop, to keep George from committing suicide.

The 57-year-old was arrested after a search warrant was carried out in Islington at 07:30 BST on Tuesday. He is in custody in a police station in north London, police said. Six men have already been jailed for their part in the raid over Easter weekend in 2015. It was branded the \\"largest burglary in English legal history\\". At a confiscation ruling in January the four ringleaders of the heist were ordered to pay back £27.5m or serve another seven years in jail. Prosecutors said John \\"Kenny\\" Collins, Daniel Jones, Terry Perkins and Brian Reader - who were all in their 60s and 70s - benefited by an estimated £13.69m from the burglary. Only £4.3m had been recovered. Perkins died a week after the confiscation ruling at Woolwich Crown Court.

Scotland Yard said a 57-year-old man was detained on Tuesday morning in London in connection with the 2015 burglary in which which elderly crooks broke into a secure vault and stolejewellery, cash, gold and platinum. Announcing the arrest, police said a number of items were seized from the address raided in Islington, north London, when detectives executed a search warrant at 7.30am. Flying Squad detectives have been searching for those who evaded capture after the burglary. Their main target has been Basil, a mystery figure who has been at large for the past three years. After members of the gang were convicted and jailed for the heist in 2016, police put out an appeal for information about Basil. There are no plans to reissue it, it is understood. Police think he played a crucial role in getting the gang into the building housing the vault that contained the safety deposit boxes. The mystery man helped the gang but his identity has never become public. Those convicted of the burglary say they did not know his real name. Police gave few details about the raid, but said the man was arrested “on suspicion of non-residential burglary”, and not for the lesser charge of handling stolen goods. The heist over the Easter weekend in 2015 was the largest burglary in English criminal history and a large amount of the stolen valuables are still unaccounted for. The men drilled through a 50cm-thick concrete wall and broke into 73 security boxes in London’s diamond district without leaving a forensic trace. Among the ringleaders convicted after a 2016 trial were John Collins, 77, of Islington; Daniel Jones, 63, of Enfield, north London; Brian Reader, 78, of Dartford, Kent; and Terry Perkins, 69, from Enfield, who died in prison in February. The break-in began on 2 April 2015 and CCTV showed Collins and others arriving in a white van at Hatton Garden at around 8.20pm. Soon after, a red-haired man – the unidentified Basil, possibly wearing a wig – let them in through a fire exit on a nearby street, which had access to the building housing the vault at 88-90 Hatton Garden. Basil opened the door of the building, having gained codes for doors and a key for a mortice lock on the front door. Police believe Basil, whose face investigators were unable to get a clear image of from the CCTV footage, was brought in for technical expertise. He was most likely involved in several roles, including neutralising the alarm and handling the electrics. Once in, Basil opened a fire escape door to the building. ||||| The thieves ransacked 73 safe deposit boxes and stuffed the loot into plastic garbage cans before making their getaway. Officers later found the book “Forensics for Dummies” at one suspect’s home. They continued to use their cellphones after the burglary, helping detectives to trace them. Prosecutors said that the ringleaders — Daniel Jones, 61; Terrence Perkins, 67; John Collins, 75; and Brian Reader; 77 — had received an estimated £13.7 million from the burglary, but only £4.3 million has been recovered.

In a confiscation hearing this year, prosecutors said that the gang members must pay back more than £6 million each based on their “available assets” or face an additional seven years in jail. “A number of these defendants are not only of a certain age, but have in some cases serious health problems,” Judge Christopher Kinch said during the hearing. “But as a matter of principle and policy, it is very difficult to endorse any approach that there is particular treatment for someone who chooses to go out and commit offenses at the advanced stage of their lives that some of these defendants were.” Mr. Perkins, who had diabetes and health problems, died in his cell in Belmarsh prison in February, a week after he was ordered to pay compensation. It is unclear if the arrest on Tuesday cleared up the one remaining mystery in the case: the identity of another burglar, known as Basil, who was filmed by security cameras during the theft but who had not been caught. The police suspect that he opened a door to a fire escape to allow the rest of the gang to enter, and that he sought to disable the alarm protecting the safe deposit boxes. Mr. Jones had written a letter to Sky News saying that Basil was a former police officer who was involved in private security. But prosecutors have said that Mr. Jones misled the authorities in the past. The police had offered a reward of £20,000 for information leading to Basil’s arrest. ||||| Share this article with Google Plus The huge holes bored through a half-meter thick concrete wall drilled to access a vault in a safe deposit centre in Hatton Garden, London (Picture: Getty) A fresh arrest has been made by detectives investigating the Hatton Garden heist.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? pick from the following. + mid-ocean ridges; + desert sand dunes; + U-shaped valleys; + continental shelves;","completion":"The correct answer to the question, \\"Which of these features of Earth's crust are caused by the shifting of tectonic plates?\\" is: + mid-ocean ridges A brief on each of the given choices helps us determine the correct answer by understanding how they are formed and their relation to tectonic plates: 1. Mid-Ocean Ridges: Mid-ocean ridges are underwater mountain ranges, formed by the interaction of tectonic plates. These geological features are the result of the process known as seafloor spreading, where new oceanic crust is created by the upwelling of magma at the boundary of two diverging tectonic plates. As molten material emerges from the mantle and solidifies, it pushes the older crust on either side of the ridge apart, causing the plates to move apart. This continuous process can cause earthquakes and the formation of volcanoes along the ridge. Some examples of mid-ocean ridges include the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the East Pacific Rise, and the Indian Ocean Ridge. 2. Desert Sand Dunes: Desert sand dunes are wind-blown sand formations that develop over time in arid environments. While tectonic plate movement can have an indirect influence on the formation of deserts by altering global weather patterns and the location of landmasses, it is not the primary cause of sand dunes themselves. Instead, sand dune formation is controlled by local wind and sediment supply conditions. Examples of desert sand dunes can be seen in the Sahara Desert, Arabian Desert, and the Great Basin Desert in North America. 3. U-Shaped Valleys: U-shaped valleys are large, glacier-carved valleys with a distinct U-shaped cross-sectional profile. The formation of U-shaped valleys is the result of a glacier eroding its way through a previously V-shaped river valley, typically during an ice age. As the glacier flows through the valley, it deepens and widens the landscape, creating the signature U-shape. While tectonic plate movements and the resulting changes in climate can influence the formation of glaciers, the actual shaping of U-shaped valleys is caused by the erosional forces of glaciers. Examples of U-shaped valleys can be found in the Alps, the Canadian Rockies, and the Himalayas. 4. Continental Shelves: Continental shelves are the submerged, relatively shallow parts of continents that slope gradually seaward. They extend from the coastline to the point where they slope sharply downward to the deep ocean floor, called the shelf break. Continental shelves are formed by the accumulation of sediments brought by rivers or through coastal erosion, as well as being a part of the continental crust. The formation of continental shelves is impacted by various factors, including sea level variation and the geological processes of the continental crust, but it is not directly caused by the shifting of tectonic plates.

Movie title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor.

Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"Try using shampoo daily until symptoms are under control; then start to wash two or three times a week. If one type of shampoo loses its effectiveness after a while, try alternating between two types of anti-dandruff shampoos. It is important to maintain a consistent hair care routine to effectively manage dandruff. Using an anti-dandruff shampoo specifically designed to target the cause of dandruff can help reduce the presence of flakes and scalp irritation. When first starting the treatment, it is recommended to wash your hair with the shampoo daily, as this helps to keep the dandruff under control and lessens the severity of symptoms. Once the dandruff has become more manageable, you can reduce the frequency of washing your hair with the anti-dandruff shampoo. Washing your hair two or three times a week should be sufficient to maintain control over dandruff. This will help prevent the overuse of shampoo, which can sometimes lead to dryness and further irritation of the scalp. However, it is not uncommon for a specific type of shampoo to lose its effectiveness over time. This can happen due to various reasons, such as your scalp becoming resistant to the active ingredients in the shampoo, or changes in your body's chemistry. When this occurs, it's essential to find an alternative solution. The best way to tackle this issue is to alternate between two different types of anti-dandruff shampoos. This can help maintain the effectiveness of the treatment, as your scalp is exposed to different active ingredients and thus does not become resistant to one specific type. It's important to select shampoos that target various causes of dandruff, such as those containing zinc pyrithione, ketoconazole, salicylic acid, or coal tar. By following these steps and establishing a consistent hair care routine, you should be able to successfully manage and control your dandruff symptoms. Keep in mind that individual responses to treatments may vary, so finding the right combination of shampoos and washing frequency that works best for you may take some experimentation.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Sabina left after they left their family? from the following article ? Tomas, a successful brain surgeon in Communist Czechoslovakia, is pursuing an affair with Sabina, an equally care-free artist in Prague. Dr Tomas takes a trip to a spa town for a specialized surgery. There, he meets dissatisfied waitress Tereza, who desires intellectual stimulation. She tracks him down in Prague and moves in with him, complicating Tomas's affairs. Tomas asks Sabina to help Tereza find work as a photographer. Tereza is fascinated and jealous as she grasps that Sabina and Tomas are lovers, but feels affection for Sabina. Nevertheless, Tomas marries Tereza, in a simple ceremony with both perpetually laughing, followed by her double standard distress about Tomas' promiscuity. Although she considers leaving Tomas, she becomes more attached to Tomas when the Soviet Army invades Czechoslovakia. Amidst the confusion, Tereza photographs demonstrations against the Soviet forces, then hands the rolls of film to foreigners to smuggle to the West.

Determine the sentiment: In 1943, a group of RAF Officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decide to escape from a POW camp using a Gymnastic Vaulting Horse in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to film his account, and it kick-started a peculiar British Film Genre- the Military Prison Camp story that reached its apogee in Danger Within (1959). The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest films I have ever watched. There are no great dramatic moments, but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn't give way for unlikely drama, jump cuts or jacked up (somethings about to happen!) music. It is utterly of its time and works beautifully. Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet. They keep emotion out of their roles. As so many were, until recently, ex-service, I suspect they recreated their war time roles as 'Officers and Gentlemen'. This unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most Wartime Escape Films, the story doesn't end at the barbed wire: and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end.","completion":"The sentiment of this passage seems to be positive towards the movie \\"The Wooden Horse.\\" The writer mentions how the film is quiet and has a steady storyline, which builds up to a climax that creates tension.

The earliest origins of the sport date back to the Middle Ages in England, Scotland, France and the Netherlands. The game can be played on a grass field or a turf field as well as an indoor board surface. Each team plays with eleven players, including the goalie. Players use sticks made out of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities (with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break) to hit a round, hard, plastic ball. The length of the stick depends on the player's individual height. Only one end of the stick is allowed to be used. Goalies often have a different kind of stick, however they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, this is to give them more surface area to save the ball. The uniform consists of shin guards, shoes, shorts, a mouth guard and a jersey. Today, the game is played globally, with particular popularity throughout Western Europe, the Indian subcontinent, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States (such as Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania).

Process: - Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - The water is boiled to a very high tempature - The salt becomes seperated from the water - The salt is removed - The water is able to be drank at this point. Question: suppose winds are funneled toward the turbine happens, how will it affect higher temperature used. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"A: More To fully comprehend why the answer is \\"more,\\" we must analyze the entire process and understand how wind affects the system's temperature. When we consider the process of desalinating saltwater, it's essential to note that the procedure typically involves boiling the water at high temperatures. As the water evaporates, salt particles are separated from the water, leaving behind freshwater that can be consumed. Various methods are used to achieve this, including high-temperature process heating (such as using steam) or methods that optimize the use of heat available from the system (like multi-stage flash distillation). In the context of the question, if winds are funneled toward the turbine, it implies that there is an increase in airflow over the desalination system. The wind, much like a cooling fan in a heat-generating device, will have a cooling effect on the system. Greater airflow will lead to improved heat exchange, dissipating excessive heat from the system and increasing its efficiency. As a result, the desalination process might have to counter the cooling effect of the wind by maintaining higher temperatures to ensure optimal evaporation of water. Therefore, if the wind were funneled towards the turbine and the associated temperature dynamics in the desalination process, there would likely be a need for higher temperatures to compensate for the increased cooling effect brought about by the wind. This is why the answer is \\"more.\\" It is necessary to highlight that multiple factors influence the desalination process, and this answer assumes that the cooling effect of the wind is sufficiently significant to raise the required temperature. Depending on the specific setup and efficiency of the desalination system and the local environment, there is a possibility that the effect of wind on the temperature requirement might be lower under some circumstances. Nonetheless, the general trend would suggest that increased wind will lead to a need for higher temperatures in the desalination process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not to be deterred , we decided to put to use some of the tracking skills we learned on safari . Answer the following question: What will likely happen next ?","completion":"Given the context, several possibilities could occur next in the story. To use some tracking skills they learned on safari implying they have a sense of adventure and problem-solving abilities, they would possibly try to deduce their parents' location. They might first search for clues at the house. They might check whether a note was left, observe to see if any specific clothing was missing suggesting their parents went to a specific event, or if any dishes are left in the sink which could hint that parents will come back soon. Perhaps they would try to notice any new items that weren't there before like tickets to events, a brochure for a local restaurant, or a receipt from a nearby shop. Interpreting these clues can guide them on their next step. If for instance, they found event tickets, they may head to that location hoping to surprise their parents there. If they saw a receipt from a local shop or restaurant, it might imply their parent's recent activities, and they could go to these places to ask if anyone has seen them. In order to gather more information, they could also talk to the neighbors. Neighbors could be aware of their parent's plans, especially if they are on good terms. Another approach might be to visit their parents' common hangout spots. This could be a local pub, park, or community center. Their parents might have a predictable routine, so they could try to interrupt that. Also, it is worth mentioning that even though the couple has decided to be sneaky, they might change their mind and call their parents directly or any mutual acquaintance who might be aware of the parent's plan, as it would be quite impractical if their parents were out for a longer period or out of the city. If, on the other hand, their parents are out of town, the couple could decide to enjoy themselves and have a little holiday of their own. This would present a delightful twist, making their surprise visit an unexpected adventure. So, the story can take several directions based on the context and the couple's decisions, given their adventurous nature and impressive tracking skills. It clearly reflects that an exciting process of investigation is about to begin, leading to several humorous, unexpected, or joyous events, making their journey an unforgettable one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the last names of the four people that led the march and formed a breakaway group? Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival.

Q: where is the shema found in the torah? A:","completion":"The Shema is found in the Torah, specifically within the book of Deuteronomy, often referred to as Devarim in Hebrew. The Shema is considered one of the most essential prayers in Judaism and serves as a declaration of faith and absolute monotheism. The verse in question appears in Deuteronomy 6:4, which states: \\"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\\" In Hebrew, this verse is written as \\"שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָֽד\\". The term \\"Shema\\" itself derives from the Hebrew word \\"שְׁמַע\\", which translates to \\"hear\\" or \\"listen.\\" The Shema appears in a wider context within a passage known as the Shema Yisrael, encompassing Deuteronomy 6:4-9, shaping the basic tenets of Jewish belief and tradition. This passage outlines the importance of wholeheartedly loving God, obeying His commandments, and passing these teachings on to future generations. Additionally, it emphasizes the significance of the first commandment: acknowledging the existence of only one God, who is forever indivisible and incorporeal. The Shema prayer also consists of three additional biblical passages: Deuteronomy 11:13-21, Numbers 15:37-41, and Deuteronomy 6:10-12. These passages reiterate devotion to God, the need to follow His commandments, and serve as a reminder of the miraculous exodus from Egyptian slavery. Collectively, these four passages come together to form the central prayer of Judaism. The Shema prayer is recited twice daily, during morning (Shacharit) and evening (Ma'ariv) services in accordance with God's command to \\"speak of them when you sit at home and when you cross the road when you lie down and when you rise\\" (Deuteronomy 6:7). In addition to daily scriptural readings, the Shema is also included as part of the bedtime prayer (Kriat Shema al haMitah) and is spoken by Jews on their deathbed as a final affirmation of faith. The Shema holds great importance in Jewish life and practice since it serves as a public declaration of faith, a reminder of the relationship between God and the Jewish people, and a focal point for daily prayer. It holds a central position within Jewish worship both privately and publicly, reflecting the fundamental belief in a single, omnipotent, and ever-present God."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Shape a smaller cone for the pencil tip.","completion":"Title: How to Make a Cute Pencil Tip Using Fondant Hi little friends! Today, we're going to learn how to make a cute pencil tip using fondant. Fondant is a special kind of sugar dough that we can play with and shape into all sorts of things. It's like play-dough, but you can eat it! Let's start by making a pencil tip step by step: Step 1: Roll the fondant First, we need to take some fondant and roll it into a tube, like a long snake. Make sure it's about the same size as the eyeliner your mommy uses. Eyeliner is that little stick she uses to draw on her eyes. So remember, we need a long, skinny tube of fondant! Step 2: Create a beige cone Now, we are going to create the wood part of the pencil tip. Take some beige (that's a light brown color) fondant and shape it into a cone. A cone looks like a birthday hat or an ice cream cone. It's a little tricky, so you might need to practice a bit. Keep trying until you have a nice, pointy cone. Step 3: Shape a smaller cone for the pencil tip Almost done! This time, you need to create a smaller cone that will be the actual pencil tip. Get a different color fondant; it can be black, blue, red, or any color you like. Shape it into a tiny cone. Remember, it should be smaller than the beige one. Step 4: Assemble your pencil tip Now it's time to put everything together. Take the long, skinny tube of fondant and attach the beige cone to one end. Then, take the smaller colored cone and stick it to the pointy end of the beige cone. Hooray! You've just made a cute pencil tip using fondant. And that's all, kids! Now you have learned how to make a fun and cute fondant pencil tip. You can make a bunch of them in different colors and give them to your friends or decorate your birthday cake. Remember to always have fun when playing with fondant and use your imagination to create amazing shapes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the first names of the people Iris and Mikie visit in Boston? In turn-of-the-century Oakland, California, the teenaged Myrtle McKinley is expected to follow high school by attending a San Francisco business college. Instead, she takes a job performing with a traveling vaudeville troupe, where she meets and falls in love with singer-dancer Frank Burt. Frank proposes they marry and also entertain on stage together as an act, which proves very popular. Myrtle retires from show business after giving birth to daughters Iris and Mikie, while her husband goes on tour with another partner. A few years later, less successful now, Frank persuades his wife to return to the stage. The girls are cared for by their grandmother as their parents leave town for months at a time. Iris and Mikie are school girls when they are given a trip to Boston to see their parents. Iris meets a well-to-do young man, Bob Clarkman, and is permitted to attend an exclusive boarding school there. She is embarrassed by her parents' profession, however, and mortified at what the reaction will be from Bob and all of her new school friends when they learn that her parents are performing nearby. Myrtle and Frank take matters into their own hands, arranging with the school to have all of the students attend a show.

Article: OAKLAND, Calif. -- Stephen Curry was cooking so much in the third quarter of Game 3 that after a successful driving floater in traffic, he faced the crowd, took his mouthpiece out and shouted, \\"This is my f---ing house!\\" \\"I blacked out,\\" he said. Curry's emotions erupted in step with his offensive output as he scored 18 of his game-high 35 points in a pivotal third quarter in which the Golden State Warriors broke the game open, resulting in a 126-85 thumping of the Houston Rockets to take a 2-1 series lead in the Western Conference finals. His mother, Sonya Curry, was pleased with her son's performance, but not with his mouth. \\"She already sent me two home videos, showing me the clip and playing it back,\\" Curry told ESPN. \\"She was telling me how I need to wash my mouth out, saying to wash it out with soap. It's a message I've heard before.\\" It was Curry's breakout game in this series, but he is a devout Christian and says he understands why he received such a scolding. \\"She's right,\\" Curry told ESPN. \\"I gotta do better. I can't talk like that.\\" He cooled off his tongue thereafter, but he channeled his emotions elsewhere. In the same quarter, Curry received the ball from Kevin Durant well beyond the 3-point line and launched a 30-footer over the outstretched arms of Chris Paul that tickled nothing but the net. About a minute later, Curry used a screen to get James Harden to switch onto him and he crossed him over and nailed a step-back contested triple. And while backpedaling to get set on defense, the two-time MVP stopped and performed a shimmy dance to the fans' delight. \\"You know, I've seen those explosions happen here and everywhere,\\" said Draymond Green, who provided 10 points, a game-high 17 boards and six assists. \\"It's not just here. Nonetheless, definitely get a lot of support from the fans. His 3 is similar to some people's dunk. You go to certain arenas and a guy gets a dunk and it's just absurd. That's how his 3-ball is. But definitely a lot of support. The fans were great tonight. I think he had a great quarter there in that third quarter. I don't mean to disappoint, but I've seen crazier from him, but it was good to see.\\" Curry thrived despite a Rockets game plan that continued to target him on the defensive end, a strategy that had seemed to work in tiring him out in Games 1 and 2. Curry was the primary defender on 15 plays in Game 3, tied for the second most by a Warriors player with Kevon Looney behind Green's 17. In Game 2, the Rockets targeted Curry on 23 possessions, the most he has been targeted in a game this postseason. He was the primary defender on 20 plays in Game 1. With Curry getting picked on defensively for the series' first two games, it was Harden's turn Sunday. The Warriors were 7-of-11 from the field with Harden as the primary defender, and it included a combined 6-of-7 by Curry and Durant, who supplied 25 points. Golden State shot 8-of-14 (6-of-10 contested) against Harden. Of the eight field goals that the Warriors made against Harden, five were layups or dunks. \\"Just being aggressive in those situations,\\" Curry said about attacking Harden. \\"Because I find myself in those type of isolation situations a lot with how they guard, so you can make plays and be ready for those type of one-on-one situations.\\" Going into the contest, Curry was struggling with the long ball, with 2-of-13 shooting from beyond the arc. He started off the game 1-of-6 from 3, but ended the evening 13-of-23 from the field and 5-of-12 on 3-pointers. He said the emotions he played with had nothing to do with how much his play has been criticized recently. \\"A lot of it was just [me] talking to myself, almost like you've got to be your biggest fan sometimes,\\" he said. \\"No matter what questions I was being asked over the first two games or what the expectations was, I had the highest expectations for myself. And you've just got to -- find whatever you want to get going. I mean, obviously, it felt good, and you want to use that energy to show your teammates that you're here, you're with them, get the crowd into it. But it's one game, and you've got to have that same type of energy and intentions and focus the next game and the right approach. So, I did my job tonight. I've got to do it again.\\" Curry, Durant and Klay Thompson (13) combined for 73 points. The Warriors are 4-0 this postseason when the trio combine for 70 or more. Curry extended his NBA-record streak of playoff games with a made 3-pointer to 82 games. He appears to be back, but his coach says he never left. \\"This guy's a two-time MVP, and he bounces back from bad games as well as anybody I've ever seen, so it didn't surprise me,\\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ||||| Steph Curry's mom: Wash your mouth out with soap Even Steph Curry can be scolded by his mom once in a while. Cameras caught the Golden State Warriors guard screaming a profane \\"This is my (bleeping) house\\" after one play in the Dubs' Game 3 blowout of the Houston Rockets, which resulted in a call from Sonya Curry. \\"This is my f***in' house\\" + shimmy from Steph Curry pic.twitter.com/f9rSD2wHqp — Born Salty (@cjzero) May 21, 2018 From ESPN: \\"She already sent me two home videos, showing me the clip and playing it back,\\" Curry told ESPN. \\"She was telling me how I need to wash my mouth out, saying to wash it out with soap. It's a message I've heard before.\\" … \\"She's right,\\" Curry told ESPN. \\"I gotta do better. I can't talk like that.\\" Oops. It was in the heat of the moment and probably an emotional night for Curry, who's had his share of struggles since returning from injury. The curse seen 'round the world was also on the mind of his teammate Klay Thompson, who said he hoped Curry's daughter Riley \\"didn't see it.\\" But he also noted that it got the Warriors' arena \\"fired up.\\" So maybe a little soap in the mouth was worth it.

Context: Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.

Two planes hijacked by terrorists associated with the terrorist group Al-Qaeda crashed into the Twin Towers, resulting in their collapse. The precise times of the collapse of each tower are as follows: 1. North Tower (WTC 1): The North Tower, also known as the World Trade Center 1 (WTC 1), was hit first when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the building at 8:46 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time). The plane struck the North Tower between the 93rd and 99th floors, causing massive structural damage and igniting a fire. The fire, combined with the damage, weakened the building's steel supports and ultimately led to its collapse at 10:28 a.m. Approximately 1 hour and 42 minutes elapsed between the initial impact of the plane and the collapse of the North Tower. 2. South Tower (WTC 2): The South Tower, or World Trade Center 2 (WTC 2), was hit shortly after the North Tower when United Airlines Flight 175 struck the building at 9:03 a.m. The plane collided with the South Tower between the 77th and 85th floors, causing a similar scenario of structural damage and intense fires as seen in the North Tower. However, the South Tower collapsed earlier than the North Tower, at 9:59 a.m., approximately 56 minutes after it was struck by the plane. It is important to remember that the collapse of the World Trade Center towers had devastating consequences, taking the lives of almost 3,000 people. The attack on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, also caused significant destruction and loss of life at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania, where a fourth hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed after passengers attempted to regain control from the terrorists on board.

AP - Paul Hamm is finally going to have an answer for everyone who asks if he's going to be able to keep his Olympic gold medal.","completion":"This question is about Paul Hamm, an American artistic gymnast, who faced controversy regarding his Olympic gold medal in men's All-Around gymnastics competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Paul Hamm won the gold medal in a dramatic come-from-behind victory after a significant error in his vault performance. After overcoming the setback, he performed exceptionally well in the remaining events and edged out his opponents to claim the All-Around title. The controversy arose after it was discovered that there was a scoring error in the Parallel Bars routine of South Korean gymnast Yang Tae-Young, who won the bronze medal. The error was a result of the judges wrongly deducting 0.1 points from Yang's start value, which is a measure of the routine's difficulty. If the correct start value had been applied, Yang would have won the gold medal, with Hamm being awarded the silver. The South Korean Olympic committee filed a complaint with the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) requesting a review of the judging process. FIG admitted the scoring error and suspended the judges responsible. However, they did not change the results or request that Paul Hamm return his gold medal, as they believed that the South Korean delegation should have protested immediately following the competition. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) supported Hamm's right to keep the gold medal, arguing that many competitions do not change standings once they are finalized, even in the event of a judging mistake. They also contended that revisiting the final results could open the door for countless similar appeals in various sports and disrupt the integrity of the Olympic Games. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was eventually called in to make a final decision on the matter. On October 21, 2004, CAS denied South Korea's appeal to change the results. They ruled that Yang Tae-Young's final score couldn't be modified due to the time limit for appeals having expired, and there was not sufficient evidence to prove that the judges' error was an act of \\"bad faith or dishonesty.\\" After the CAS ruling, Paul Hamm was allowed to keep his Olympic gold medal, putting an end to the controversy. Despite the contentious circumstances surrounding his victory, Hamm's remarkable comeback performance remains an iconic moment in the history of Olympic gymnastics. The controversy also led to sweeping changes in the sport of gymnastics, with the FIG implementing a new scoring system to reduce subjectivity in judging and to ensure greater accuracy in evaluating routines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Military history of the United States In the Treaty of Paris after the Revolution, the British had ceded the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the United States, without consulting the Shawnee, Cherokee, Choctaw and other smaller tribes who lived there. Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British, the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties, and began dividing these lands for settlement. This provoked a war in the Northwest Territory in which the U.S. forces performed poorly; the Battle of the Wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians.

A few miles up river, they come across a half-sunken boat when suddenly something crashes into the tourists' boat, creating a crack in the side. Kate's only choice is to run it ashore on a small island in the middle of the river. The group disembarks and begins discussion of what to do. Everett suddenly disappears, pulled into the water by an unseen predator. Kate comes to the conclusion that they are in the heart of a large crocodile's territory and that it will be more aggressive than usual.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Born in eastern Ohio in Martins Ferry, just north and across the Ohio River from Wheeling, West Virginia, Groza's parents were immigrants from Transylvania, part of modern-day Romania. His Hungarian mother Mary and Romanian father John (Ioan) Groza owned and ran Groza's Tavern on Main Street. Lou was the smallest in stature of four boys in an athletic family; his brother Alex became a star basketball player at the University of Kentucky, a member of two national championship teams. After Groza retired, he entertained an offer to play for the San Francisco 49ers, but was reluctant to do so because he did not want to move his family and insurance business to the West Coast. He was offered a spot with the Browns as a kicking coach, helping mentor the young Don Cockroft, but he declined. Later in life, he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns, inviting rookies over for dinner and helping them find apartments. He continued to run a successful insurance business and lived in Berea, Ohio near the Browns' headquarters and training facility. He and his wife Jackie were known as the team's First Family. Modell relocated the Browns to Baltimore in 1995 and renamed the team the Ravens, provoking a wave of anger and disbelief from fans and former players. Groza was a leading critic of the move, saying it was \\"like some man walking off with your wife.\\" In 1996, Groza wrote a memoir titled The Toe: The Lou Groza Story. The Browns restarted as an expansion team in 1999. Groza was hobbled in the late 1990s by back and hip surgeries and Parkinson's disease. He suffered a heart attack in 2000 after dinner with his wife at Columbia Hills Country Club in Columbia Station, Ohio. He was taken to a hospital in Middleburg Heights, Ohio, where he died. He was buried in Sunset Memorial Park in North Olmsted, Ohio. Groza and his wife had three sons and a daughter. Following Groza's death, the Browns wore his number 76 on their helmets for the 2001 season.

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. I am facing a new situation today: David is a physicist. He teaches school children how matters and energy work. One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the knowledge from the background article, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. The faster a particle moves, the more kinetic energy it has, leading to a higher temperature. In your new situation involving David, the physicist, particle A moves faster than particle B.

Article:Jamie Chapman, who has also worked as a teaching assistant and sports coach, tricked the teenage boys into sending him naked images of themselves. The 28-year-old from Solihull, West Midlands, has admitted rape and 21 offences of causing or inciting sexual activity with children. He will be sentenced on Tuesday. Birmingham Crown Court heard he duped 18 victims in all, with the offences taking place between 2011 and 2016. He created fake Facebook personas of teenage girls and would use them to get boys to send him naked images. The boys would then be urged to engage in sex acts and, if they they refused, he would blackmail them by threatening to send their photos to their friends or family. Prosecutor Matthew Brook said Chapman's aims were to get the boys to send him naked pictures so he could blackmail them, and then to encourage them to meet up with a boy and, ultimately, to meet up with himself. One blackmail victim agreed to meet a boy, who turned out to be Chapman. Chapman, of Tamar Drive, raped him and filmed it on the boy's phone.

The Paralympic star was jailed for five years in 2014 for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp. Ms Steenkamp's parents have said that the time he has served is \\"not enough for taking a life\\". A state appeal against his acquittal on murder charges is due in November. Under South African law, Pistorius is eligible for release under \\"correctional supervision\\" having served a sixth of his sentence. South African Commissioner of Correctional Services Zach Modise told the BBC that the case management committee at the Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria, where Pistorius is being held, made the recommendation last week. The decision is likely to mean a spell under house arrest for Pistorius. The double amputee shot and killed Ms Steenkamp through a locked bathroom door at his Pretoria home, believing she was an intruder, he told his trial. In March a Johannesburg court blocked his legal team's attempts to stop the prosecutors' appeal. State prosecutors say Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder - if convicted he could face a much more lengthy jail term. Tania Koen, a lawyer for Ms Steenkamp's parents Barry and June, said that while the two had forgiven Pistorius, \\"ten months is not enough\\". \\"It also doesn't send out the proper message and serve as the proper deterrent as the way it should.\\" The decision will reignite a national debate in South Africa about the rule of law, says the BBC's Milton Nkosi.

It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served?

Summarize the following: A rocks glass is a small glass tumbler that holds between 6 to 10 fl oz (180 to 300 mL). These are often decorative and you can purchase them alone or as part of a whiskey decanter set. Drinking your Jameson from a rocks glass will promote a smooth drinking experience. Keep in mind that you can drink whiskey out of any glass you want. For example, you could pour it into a ceramic coffee mug, a tin cup, or even a disposable plastic cup if that’s what you want to use. If you want to experience the full spectrum of flavors in the whiskey, then don’t add anything to it. Simply pour a 1.5 fl oz (44 mL) serving of room temperature Jameson into a rocks glass or other drinking vessel, and enjoy! You can pour a larger serving if you prefer. Just remember that whiskey is a very strong drink so it is best to drink only a small amount at a time. If you want to chill your Jameson, use a large ice cube. Using multiple small ice cubes will quickly dilute the Jameson and cool down the alcohol which this will mute the flavor. To make Jameson cold without adding too much water, add a large cube-shaped or spherical ice cube to the glass. You can purchase special ice cube trays for whiskey. Check culinary stores and online retailers to find a large spherical or cube-shaped ice tray. If you want to chill Jameson without water, then purchase a set of whiskey rocks. These are granite or stainless steel cubes that you freeze and add to whiskey in place of ice. Add about 0.5 fl oz (15 ml) of water, then taste the Jameson to see if this makes it easier for you to drink. If it still tastes too strong, add another 0.5 fl oz (15 ml) of water and taste it again. Repeat until the Jameson tastes how you want it to. You may find it easier to detect subtle flavors in the whiskey even after adding a few drops of water. Put your mouth on the glass as if you are going to take a sip and tip the glass so that your nose is in it. Then, take a deep breath in through your nose to inhale the scent of the Jameson. Take a small sip and let the sip linger on your tongue for a moment before you swallow. Common scents and flavors you might notice include toffee, vanilla, and caramel. Because Jameson is so strong, it is best to sip the entire drink slowly. Take your time and savor the flavors and scent of the Jameson. You can hold the glass in your hands while drinking to keep it warm or set it down if you have added ice to your drink.","completion":"A rocks glass is a special little cup that can hold 6 to 10 ounces (180 to 300 mL) of a drink, usually used for whiskey like Jameson. These glasses can be pretty and sometimes come with a special container for whiskey. You can drink whiskey from any kind of cup, even a coffee mug or a plastic one. It's best to not add anything to the whiskey if you want to taste all its flavors. To enjoy it, pour a small serving and drink slowly. If you want a cold drink, use big ice cubes, special ice trays, or cool rock-like things that you can freeze. Adding a little bit of water might make the whiskey taste better. When drinking, smell it first and try to notice sweet smells like toffee, vanilla, and caramel. Drink slowly and enjoy the taste!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Most of the time, we choose colors for decorating based on our personal taste and our sense of aesthetics . But, a number of color experts believe that colors have an effect on our emotions and that it would be wise of us to be conscious of that before settling on a definite choice. Some of the effects of colors are well known and accepted by most people. In fact, those effects have been the subject of serious research and experiments and have been scientifically proven. But not all scientists agree on the validity of the results. When we become interested in the psychological effects of colors, it is important to know that not all societies share our opinion of those effects on our emotions. What we hold as an \\"objective\\" observation on a color is often nothing more than a reflection of our cultural belongingness, which has attributed properties to that color for generations. Why is it not possible for us to hold a really objective discourse on the subject? In part, because it is very difficult to separate the psychological from the symbolic, the symbolic aspects are definitely cultural. Often, and this without our realizing it, they influence our understanding of colors and the following emotions - both psychological aspects. Black and white are good examples. In western countries, black is considered serious, dramatic and sometimes sad. People are warned against its potentially depressing effects on decoration. Black is the traditional color of mourning. White, on the other hand, is associated with purity, peace and optimism. For those reasons, white is the traditional color of bridal dresses. No one would think of attending a funeral in white. Any more than it would occur to a bride to wear black. We simply remain convinced that it is not in the \\"nature\\" of those colors. Yet, in certain oriental countries, it is white, not black that is the color of mourning. That having been said, there is some \\"overlapping\\" in the properties different cultures attribute to certain colors. For example, Feng Shui, the...

The app has undoubtedly proven to be a useful addition to my daily smartphone experience, but there are some areas where I believe it could be even better. Firstly, I appreciate the convenience that the Home Button Launcher app brings to my device. The app allows me to customize and quickly access my frequently used apps right from the home button, saving me time and hassle. The interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate, which is a huge plus and reflects the developer's attention to detail. Another feature I truly enjoy is the ability to create shortcuts to specific app actions. This has made it much easier for me to streamline tasks like sending an email or composing a new message on my messaging apps. However, I have experienced occasional minor bugs in the app, such as the app icons disappearing from the launcher once in a while. While this does not directly impact functionality, it can be a little annoying at times. Additionally, this app could be improved through more robust customization options, such as additional themes and icon packs to make the home launcher feel even more personal to the user. In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Home Button Launcher app to anyone who wants to streamline their smartphone usage and have faster access to their most frequently used applications. Although there is room for improvement in terms of aesthetics and occasional bug fixes, the app does a great job overall and has genuinely improved my smartphone experience."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Shortly afterwards, Kyle Reese, a human soldier, also arrives. He steals clothes from a homeless man and evades the police. The Terminator begins systematically killing women named Sarah Connor, whose addresses it finds in the telephone directory. It tracks the third Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle rescues her. The two steal a car and escape with the Terminator pursuing them in a police car. As they hide in a parking lot, Kyle explains to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as Skynet, will become self-aware in the near future and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human. Kyle and Sarah are apprehended by the police after another encounter with the Terminator. Criminal psychologist Dr. Silberman concludes that Kyle is paranoid and delusional. The Terminator repairs its body and attacks the police station, killing many police officers in its attempt to locate Sarah. Kyle and Sarah escape and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble pipe bombs and plan their next move.

It causes either watery diarrhea or, in more severe cases, bloody diarrhea that can lead to other complications such as kidney failure. E. coli infections occur most frequently while traveling to areas of the world with poorer hygiene than we have here in North America. It is transmitted via fecal contamination of food, water, etc. Symptoms of an E. coli infection include: Abdominal pain Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Fever Abdominal cramps It is important to understand that E. coli infections are not able to be \\"cured\\" (and the bacteria cannot be \\"killed\\") with typical medical drugs such as antibiotics or even antidiarrheals. Rather, the treatment offered by medical professionals is \\"supportive,\\" meaning it consists of rest, fluids, and medications for symptom management such as pain and/or nausea. This is counter-intuitive for many people, who often expect medical drugs as a \\"cure\\" for illnesses such as an E. coli infection. Antidiarrheal medications are not helpful because they delay the passage of the infection and a worsening of symptoms. Your best bet, counter-intuitive as it may seem, is to allow the diarrhea to continue to get rid of the infection as soon as possible. Antibiotics are also not recommended — they have been shown to worsen the illness, because when the bacteria are killed they release more toxins, resulting in greater damage. Because antibiotics are not advised in E. coli infections, it will be up to your immune system to kill off the infection. Fortunately, your immune system is very capable of doing this, given adequate time and proper support. Rest, follow your doctor's instructions, and allow your immune system to do its job! Talk to your doctor about the supportive measures you can take to get through the infection. It will be important to stay hydrated as you will be losing lots of fluids while you are sick.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the three habitats that are designated as a red-zone area? from the following article ? The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays on the Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45 million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end of the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes.

Ampulla of Vater Various smooth muscle sphincters regulate the flow of bile and pancreatic juice through the ampulla: the sphincter of the pancreatic duct, the sphincter of the bile duct, and the sphincter of Oddi. Is this statement correct \\"does the ampulla of vater only contain pancreatic juice\\"?","completion":"To determine if this statement is correct, let's examine each component of the ampulla of Vater: 1. Ampulla of Vater: The ampulla of Vater, also known as the hepatopancreatic ampulla, is an important structure that connects the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct to the duodenum (small intestine's second part). 2. Pancreatic duct: This duct carries pancreatic juice, which contains digestive enzymes, from the pancreas to the duodenum. The enzymatic content in pancreatic juice aids in breaking down nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. 3. Common bile duct: This duct carries bile from the liver and the gallbladder to the duodenum. Bile, which contains bile acids, aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fats. 4. Sphincters: Three major sphincters control the passage of fluids (pancreatic juice and bile) through the ampulla of Vater. These include the sphincter of the pancreatic duct, the sphincter of the bile duct, and the sphincter of Oddi. Now, let's analyze the statement: \\"Does the ampulla of Vater only contain pancreatic juice?\\" Based on the information provided, we can conclude that the statement is not correct. The ampulla of Vater contains not only pancreatic juice but also bile. Both pancreatic juice and bile have distinct roles in the digestion process, and they mix within the ampulla before entering the duodenum. The various smooth muscle sphincters (sphincter of the pancreatic duct, sphincter of the bile duct, and the sphincter of Oddi) regulate the flow of these fluids through the ampulla."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It has been a while since we last touched base on the progress of our California projects, and I wanted to take a moment to provide you with an update, as well as share some significant developments that have taken place recently. As always, your support and continued interest in these projects is greatly appreciated. Firstly, our team has successfully completed the rollout of the new solar power generation system in the Southern California region. I am thrilled to report that the installation finished ahead of schedule and under budget, and that the system is already generating clean, renewable energy at an impressive rate. The local community has shown immense enthusiasm for this initiative, and we can proudly announce that a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the area has already begun. In terms of our affordable housing initiative in the Bay Area, we have secured the necessary permits to move forward with construction, and groundbreaking is slated for the end of this month. We have identified two viable locations for these developments, both of which are in close proximity to public transportation and essential services, ensuring accessibility and convenience for future residents. We will be working closely with the local community throughout the construction process, as well as creating job opportunities for residents. Speaking of job opportunities, our job training and placement program has achieved exceptional results thus far. Since its inception, we have managed to assist over 300 individuals in securing stable employment, vastly improving their prospects for a brighter future. Moreover, approximately 75% of these participants have managed to retain their positions for a period of six months or more, which serves as a testament to the program's impact and success. Lastly, we are excited to announce that our partnership with the California State Parks system is entering a new phase. Over the past few months, our team has been working diligently to identify potential park improvements and develop a strategy for their implementation. As a result, we will be moving ahead with plans to enhance park facilities, including upgrades to playground equipment, picnic areas, and trail systems. These enhancements will undoubtedly contribute to a more enjoyable and fulfilling experience for park visitors. As we forge ahead with these projects, your input and engagement is invaluable. If you have any questions or would like further information, please don't hesitate to reach out. We also encourage you to share this email with any colleagues or associates who may be interested in our endeavors in California.

The centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire, led to numerous Ottoman–Persian Wars. The Safavid Era peaked in the reign of Abbas the Great, 1587–1629, surpassing their Ottoman arch rivals in strength, and making the empire a leading hub in Western Eurasia for the sciences and arts. The Safavid Era saw the start of mass integration from Caucasian populations into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s, which was caused by the internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Soltan Hosein in 1722.

Summarize this article: PARKLAND, Fla. - Panicked parents searching for students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a shooter killed 17 people Wednesday in Parkland, were sharing their children's photos on social media and asking for help. Michelle Wiseman was among the 2,840 Facebook users who shared the photo of Jaime Guttenberg, before the post was removed. Her parents, Fred and Jennifer Guttenberg, later learned that Jaime died in the shooting, while their son, Jesse, made it home. Jaime Guttenberg, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was killed in the Feb. 14 shooting at the school in Parkland. \\"Praying for all of the families and kids,\\" Wiseman wrote. The Broward Sheriff's Office had yet to release the identities of the 17 dead or the 17 who were rushed to Broward Health North, Broward Medical Center, Broward Health Coral Springs and West Boca Medical Center. Authorities identified the suspected gunman as Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former troubled student at the school. Broward Health Medical Center received seven patients, out of which two were in life-threatening condition. Broward Health North received eight patients and one suspect. Three were in life-threatening condition and two died. Broward Health Coral Springs received one patient with non-life threatening injuries. It wasn't easy to get updates on social media, because most of the students posting on Snapchat and Instagram were using pseudonyms. A Twitter user known as \\"The Captain Aidan\\" published unidentifiable photos of himself and other students in a classroom. They were all sitting on the floor using their cellphones. \\"My school is being shot up and I am locked inside,\\" he wrote. \\"I’m f---- scared right now ...

According to Douglas football coach Willis May, Feis’ family was notified around midnight Wednesday or very early Thursday morning. In a news conference late Wednesday night, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel referenced a football coach dying, but did not give a name. Social media accounts throughout the day called Feis a hero, saying he was shot while helping a student. May said he heard directly from a student that Feis jumped between her and the shooter, to push her out through a door and out of the line of fire. “It is with Great sadness that our Football Family has learned about the death of Aaron Feis,” the Douglas football team’s Twitter account posted early Thursday morning. “He was our Assistant Football Coach and security guard. He selflessly shielded students from the shooter when he was shot. He died a hero and he will forever be in our hearts and memories.” Feis, in his capacity as a school security guard, responded to the original call on the school’s security radio walkie-talkies. Someone asked on the radio if the loud sounds heard were firecrackers, according to May, who also carries a radio. “I heard Aaron say, ‘No, that is not firecrackers.’ That’s the last I heard of him,” May said. May was in his football office at the time of the shooting and went into a lockdown mode with four football players and two coaches from Nichols College, who were recruiting at the school when Mays heard “Code Red” over the intercom. He added they later saw the shooter outside the office window, trying to blend in with students evacuating. As for Feis, May talked about a man he worked with and cared for deeply. “Big ol’ teddy bear,” May said of Feis. “Hardcore – he coached hard. Real good line. He did a great job with the [offensive] line. He took pride with working with those guys. Loyalty – I trusted him. He had my back. He worked hard. Just a good man. Loved his family. Loved his brother – just an excellent family man.” Earlier in the day, Douglas junior lineman Charlie Rothkopf tweeted a picture of Feis with the text: “Can everyone please take a second to pray for my coach today he took serval bullets covering other students at Douglas.” It was one of many social media tributes to Feis that floated around Wednesday in the aftermath of the shooting. “He was a great guy,” said sophomore Douglas lineman Gage Gaynor. “Everyone loved him. Shame he had to go like this. Always gave his all to making us better. Definitely learned a lot from him.” In addition to coaching linemen, Feis served as the school’s junior varsity football coach for eight years, according to his bio on the football team’s website. He also played a role in football operations and was the team’s college recruiting coordinator. Feis played center for the Eagles from 1995-98. A 1999 graduate of Douglas, he first returned to his alma mater as a coach in 2002. He resided in Coral Springs and leaves behind a wife named Melissa and a daughter, according to his bio. dfurones@sunsentinel.com / @DavidFurones_ Correspondent Gary Curreri contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"In the aftermath of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed, parents and friends of students turned to social media to locate and receive updates on their loved ones.

It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners. - A video game genre is a classification assigned to a video game based on its gameplay interaction rather than visual or narrative differences. A video game genre is defined by a set of gameplay challenges and are classified independent of their setting or game-world content, unlike other works of fiction such as films or books. For example, a shooter game is still a shooter game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space. - First-person shooter (FPS) is a video game genre which is centered on gun and projectile weapon-based combat through a first-person perspective; that is, the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist. The first-person shooter shares common traits with other shooter games, which in turn fall under the heading action game. From the genre's inception, advanced 3D or pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development, and multiplayer gaming has been integral. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

This document was more holistic than any President Kennedy had offered, and therefore more controversial. It aimed not only to integrate public facilities, but also private businesses that sold to the public, such as motels, restaurants, theaters, and gas stations. Public schools, hospitals, libraries, parks, among other things, were included in the bill as well. It also worked with JFK's executive order 11114 by prohibiting discrimination in the awarding of federal contracts and holding the authority of the government to deny contracts to businesses who discriminate. Maybe most significant of all, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act aimed to end discrimination in all firms with 25 or more employees. Another provision established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as the agency charged with ending discrimination in the nation's workplace.:74 Now answer this question: What was the purpose of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act?","completion":"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had a critical and far-reaching purpose: to end discrimination in employment across the United States. More specifically, it aimed to prohibit employers, both public and private, from engaging in discriminatory practices based on an individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The primary target of Title VII was any firm employing 25 or more employees, ensuring that a significant portion of the American workforce would be protected from discriminatory actions. Under Title VII, employers were prohibited from making decisions related to hiring, firing, promotions, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment based on any of the aforementioned protected categories. Additionally, the legislation prohibited employers from retaliating against employees who either opposed discriminatory practices or filed charges of discrimination. Title VII also established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as the federal agency responsible for implementing, enforcing, and interpreting the provisions of the Civil Rights Act concerning workplace discrimination. The EEOC was granted the authority to investigate allegations of discrimination, initiate lawsuits intending to end discriminatory practices, and provide guidance to employers on how to comply with the provisions of the Act. In conclusion, the purpose of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was to address and eliminate the pervasive issue of employment discrimination in the United States by explicitly outlawing specific discriminatory practices and establishing an enforcement mechanism through the creation of the EEOC. This groundbreaking legislation fundamentally transformed the nation's workforce, promoting equal opportunities for all employees regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To test the effect of volcanic eruption on sea level scientists measured geological data through carbon dating. They measured the data for four different time point - for year 998, year 1000, year 1002, and year 1010. Scientists now need to compare and analyze these data. But I can use this background: As the thermal expansion is the key factor to the sea level variability, decreased heat content should result in a reduction in global mean sea levelon a decadal time scale.[2] However, Grinsted [2007] argued that a significant sea level rise is the first direct response to the volcanic eruption, and after that sea level becomes to drop. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the imbalance of ocean mass fluxes. After the volcano eruption, evaporation over ocean becomes lower, because it is largely determined by the ocean skin temperature change. The quick response of evaporation to the surface cooling and the delayed response of river runoff to the associated lower precipitation lead to an increased sea level. About 1~2 years later, river discharge becomes less due to the reduced precipitation and less sea ice melting, which cause sea level to drop.[9] What is an answer for this question: According to Grinsted, would the sea level increase or decrease right after year 1000?","completion":"According to Grinsted, the sea level would initially increase right after the volcanic eruption in year 1000."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden.

Which method do paleontologists most likely use to determine the forms of life that existed millions of years ago? What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Pick your answer from: 1). examine current species of plants and animals. 2). research past species in the library. 3). interview older scientists. 4). examine fossils records.","completion":"The correct answer to the question is option 4: examine fossil records. Paleontologists are scientists who specialize in the study of past life on Earth, focusing primarily on the remains of plants, animals, and other organisms that have been preserved in the Earth's crust. Fossil records offer the most reliable and direct evidence of the existence of these prehistoric life forms. Here is a detailed explanation of why option 4 is the correct answer and why the other choices are not: 1) Examine current species of plants and animals: While examining current species may provide some insights into the evolutionary history of life on Earth, it does not offer direct evidence of the specific life forms that existed millions of years ago. It is essential for paleontologists to study fossils to trace back the evolutionary lineage of organisms and identify the ancient species that once thrived on our planet. 2) Research past species in the library: Although libraries contain resources that can provide valuable context and background information on extinct species, they are not the primary method by which paleontologists determine the forms of life that existed millions of years ago. These scientific researchers rely heavily on the discovery and analysis of fossils, which are the tangible remains or traces of ancient organisms. By studying the physical characteristics of fossils, paleontologists can better understand the anatomy, ecology, and behavior of long-extinct life forms. 3) Interview older scientists: While consulting with other scientists can be helpful in the sharing of knowledge, skills, and techniques, it is not the most reliable method of determining the forms of life that existed millions of years ago. The information that older scientists possess would still be based on the study of fossils and related research. Therefore, the primary method of discovering ancient life forms would still be the examination of fossil records. 4) Examine fossil records: This is the correct answer. Fossils provide the most direct and concrete evidence of past life and allow paleontologists to study these extinct organisms. Fossil records include not only the preserved remains of ancient plants and animals but also traces such as footprints, burrows, and impressions that reveal information about their behavior and ecology. Analyzing the geological context in which a fossil is found can also provide crucial information about the organism's environment and possible reasons for its extinction. In conclusion, paleontologists most likely use the examination of fossil records as the primary method to determine the forms of life that existed millions of years ago. This method offers the most direct evidence of ancient species and their evolutionary processes, allowing scientists to reconstruct the history of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: James hated getting in line.

Research has already linked sugar consumption to diabetes, weight gain and obesity. “Too much sugar can make you fat; it can also make you sick, sick from diseases like cardiovascular disease, which is the No. 1 killer in America,” said Laura Schmidt, a school of medicine professor at the University of California at San Francisco, in a telephone interview. “Small amounts of sugar are fine. It’s consuming massive amounts of sugar that’s a growing problem in America.” The study also found that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, seven servings or more each week, was linked to an increased risk of dying from heart disease. 600,000 Deaths Heart disease, which can cause heart attack, chest pain and heart failure, is the leading cause of death worldwide for both men and women and kills more than 600,000 Americans each year, according to the Atlanta-based CDC. There is no specific national guideline for sugar consumption. The Institute of Medicine recommends sugar be less than 25 percent of total calories, the World Health Organization recommends less than 10 percent, while the American Heart Association suggests limiting sugar to less than 150 calories a day for men and less than 100 calories a day for women, the authors wrote. ‘The majority of us are consuming more added sugar than the recommendations,’’ Yang said in a telephone interview. About 37 percent of added sugar in U.S. diets comes from sugar-sweetened beverages, while the rest comes from grain-based desserts, fruit drinks, dairy desserts and candy, the authors said. Sugar from fresh fruits and vegetables isn’t considered added sugar. Better food labels would help people identify their sugar intake, said Schmidt, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. Sugar Effects Scientists don’t have a clear understanding why sugar may raise the risk of dying from heart disease, Yang said. Sugar may increase blood pressure and weight gain, both risk factors for heart disease, or it may raise bad cholesterol and triglycerides and lower good cholesterol. Sugar may also increase insulin resistance, a factor in diabetes, or increase fat accumulation in the liver, he said. Researchers in the study looked at data from several National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which provides nationally representative information on U.S. adults. They found that U.S. adults consumed about 14.9 percent of daily calories from added sugar in 2005-2010, down from 16.8 percent in 1999-2004. For most U.S. adults, added sugar made up 10 percent or more of their daily calories during 2005-2010 and for 10 percent of people, sugar made up 25 percent or more of their daily calories. Today’s findings support recommendations to limit intake of sugar-added foods and drinks, Yang said. “We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in research on the health effects of sugar, one fueled by extremely high rates of added sugar overconsumption in the American public,” Schmidt said in an editorial accompanying the study. To contact the reporter on this story: Nicole Ostrow in New York at nostrow1@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Reg Gale at rgale5@bloomberg.net ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers have found a link between high sugar consumption and an increased risk of death resulting from heart disease. According to the study, individuals whose sugar intake constitutes a quarter or more of their total daily calories had twice the risk of dying from heart disease compared to those whose intake was only 7%. The research also found a correlation between the regular intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (seven servings or more each week) and increased risk of heart disease-related death. This study is the first to connect the amount of sugar consumed by American adults to their risk of dying from heart disease while accounting for weight, age, health, exercise, and diet. Although there is no specific national guideline for sugar consumption, various organizations, such as the Institute of Medicine, the World Health Organization, and the American Heart Association, recommend limiting sugar intake. The study's findings support these recommendations and emphasize the importance of limiting added sugars in foods and drinks. Better food labeling could help people identify their sugar intake, making it easier to follow the recommended guidelines. Possible reasons for the increased heart disease risk due to high sugar consumption could be the impact of sugar on blood pressure and weight gain, both of which are risk factors for heart disease. Sugar might also lead to raised levels of bad cholesterol and triglycerides while reducing good cholesterol. Furthermore, high sugar intake could contribute to insulin resistance, a significant factor in diabetes, or increase fat accumulation in the liver."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Aris Thessaloniki, is a major Greek multi-sport club founded on 25 March 1914 in Thessaloniki. The club's colours are yellow of glory and black. The club is named after Ares, the ancient Greek God of War, but also associated with courage and masculinity, inspired by the successful military operations of the Kingdom of Greece during the Balkan Wars, and the liberation of Thessaloniki in 1912 from the Ottoman empire. Its image (as depicted in the Ludovisi Ares) is portrayed on the club's emblem. - Thessaloniki is the second-largest city in Greece and the capital of Greek Macedonia, the administrative region of Central Macedonia and the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace. Its nickname is (\\"Symprotévousa\\"), literally \\"the co-capital\\", a reference to its historical status as the (\\"Symvasilévousa\\") or \\"co-reigning\\" city of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, alongside Constantinople. - Black is the darkest color resulting from the absence or complete absorption of light. Like white and grey, it is an achromatic color, literally a color without hue. It is one of the four primary colors in the CMYK color model, along with cyan, yellow, and magenta, used in color printing to produce all the other colors. Black is often used to represent darkness; it is the symbolic opposite of white (or brightness). - The Greek national football team represents Greece in association football and is controlled by the Hellenic Football Federation, the governing body for football in Greece. Greece's home ground is Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus. Greece is one of only ten national teams to have been crowned UEFA European Champions. - The Hellenic Football Federation (HFF); also known as the Greek Football Federation is the governing body of football in Greece. It contributes in the organisation of Super League Greece and organizes the Greek football Cup and the Greece national football team. It is based in Athens. - The Balkan Wars (literally \\"the Balkan Wars\\" or \\"Balkan Facias\\", meaning \\"the Balkan Tragedy\\") consisted of two conflicts that took place in the Balkan Peninsula in south-eastern Europe in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war; one of the four, Bulgaria, suffered defeat in the second war. The Ottoman Empire lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples. The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus served as a \\"prelude to the First World War\\". - The Kingdom of Greece (Greek: , \\"Vasíleion ts Elládos\\") was a state established in 1832 at the Convention of London by the Great Powers (the United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire). It was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Constantinople, where it also secured full independence from the Ottoman Empire. This event also marked the birth of the first, fully independent, Greek state since the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in the mid-15th century. - Ares is the Greek god of war. He is one of the Twelve Olympians, and the son of Zeus and Hera. In Greek literature, he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war, in contrast to his sister the armored Athena, whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship. - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman.

You are given a new situation: David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. and a hint : Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. Please answer this question : If the potential energy between charge A and charge B increases, are they closer or farther? Answer:","completion":"If the potential energy between charge A and charge B increases, they are closer together. Justification: 1. According to the hint provided, when two negative charges (like charge A and charge B) are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. 2. As the two negative charges move apart, their potential energy decreases since the repulsive force between them also decreases due to increased distance. 3.

Pick your answer from: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes Both of these questions indicate a desire to achieve a state of mental and emotional calmness or tranquility, so they are essentially the same question. Now, let's dive into ways you can find peace of mind. 1. Mindfulness and meditation: Setting aside time every day for mindfulness meditation can significantly help in achieving peace of mind. Meditation helps in quieting the chatter in your mind and encourages you to stay in the present moment, without judgment. Start with just a few minutes a day and gradually increase the duration. 2. Acceptance: Accepting that certain situations or events might be beyond your control can help in achieving peace of mind. Embrace imperfections and accept that life is full of surprises - this will help you cope better with uncertainty. 3. Stay organized: Keep your life organized by decluttering your living and workspaces, creating to-do lists, and setting realistic goals to reduce stress and clutter, which can further increase your peace of mind. 4. Regular exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, reduces stress, and can help clear negative thoughts. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. 5. Connect with nature: Spending time outdoors and in nature can help in grounding yourself and finding peace of mind. Find a quiet spot in a park or by the water where you can sit and reflect on your thoughts and emotions. 6. Practice gratitude: Cultivate a habit of expressing gratitude for what you have, rather than constantly seeking more. Keep a gratitude journal to record positive experiences, and try to focus on the positive aspects of your life. 7. Develop healthy relationships: Surround yourself with positive people who support and encourage your growth. Eliminate toxic relationships that may add stress and negativity to your life. 8. Seek help when necessary: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family members, or professionals if you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed. Seeking help can be an important step towards achieving peace of mind. 9. Limit exposure to technology: Overuse of technology can be a significant source of anxiety and stress. Limit the time spent on electronic devices, especially social media, and take periodic breaks throughout the day. 10. Engage in hobbies and activities: Participate in activities that bring you joy and help you express your creativity, such as painting, writing, swimming, or gardening. Engaging in hobbies can act as a form of therapy and help in achieving peace of mind. Remember that achieving peace of mind is a journey and not a destination. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small successes along the way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Screaming Mad George was responsible for the killer toys(..including a larvae which enters a victim's mouth and out his eye, another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically strangled by a severed hand toy, operating from a remote control). The little target is a mute child named Derek(William Thorne)whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face, causing him to land on a fireplace poker. Mother Sarah(Jane Higginson)worries about her son's mental state, figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or, more importantly, talking, derives from watching her husband's horrific murder. Derek's real father, Noah(Tracy Fraim)fears for his son't safety, and informs, reluctantly, his ex-girlfriend Sarah that the local toymaker, Joe Petto(Mickey Rooney)once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash..kind of a retaliation in saying that if he couldn't have a son, then others shouldn't either. Still quite a heavy drinker(..often seen swigging Jack), Petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids, but his creepy son Pino(Brian Bremer)hasn't and Derek he harbors angst towards. Why? You'll soon understand. Pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise. Rooney's name adds an allure to the film, gaining it a notoriety, but his histrionics can only help so much. Attractive lead actress Higginson(Slaughterhouse)and Fraim as the man who re-enters her life aren't so bad, but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously. I'm guessing that's the point, but Rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this..he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation, quite volatile, barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards Pino, when not downing liquor. Bremer is appropriately weird and \\"robotic\\" as Pino, longing to have Sarah as his mama. The practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing..Screaming Mad George's work with Savage Steve Holland was far more effective than what we see in this film. The sex everyone talks about isn't as gratuitous as many would have you believe(..I can't even recall any nudity). Probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted, but that's not exactly an endorsement.

Article:Last March, the government appointed former health minister Lord Norman Warner as external commissioner to oversee the running of children's services. Ministers have had his progress report since April, but will not say when it will be released. One young woman's experience of being in the care of the authority saw her being moved 39 times in just five years and raped several times while in care. Danielle, who has waived her right to anonymity, was taken into care in 1998 at the age of 11, after slash marks from a belt were spotted on her back when she changed for PE at school. She told BBC Inside Out West Midlands the first of the 39 moves she went through saw her transferred six times in the first six weeks. \\"I don't think any of us ever felt safe,\\" Danielle, who is now in her 20s, said. \\"Half of us ran away because it was safer to run away than to be in the home sometimes.\\" When she was 11 years old, she said, someone tried to rape her in the children's home she was staying in and aged 13 she ran away. \\"[I] got tricked into going to this flat and I got locked in. \\"Then he started calling people and they kept me there for hours and I got gang raped. They locked me in a cupboard and wouldn't let me go.\\" By the time she left the care system at the age of 16, Danielle had been raped three times. As she left in 2003, a new director of children's services was appointed in Birmingham. Peter Hay inherited a zero-rated service that was already on a government watch list, where it has remained. \\"The first stage I think was to stop the thing falling off a cliff,\\" he said. But high-profile cases have continued to come, including those of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, who starved to death at her home in Handsworth in 2008, and Keanu Williams, who in 2011 was found collapsed in his mother's partner's flat. Their deaths are among 23 serious case reviews published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006. Between 2009 and October 2013, the authority had four different strategic directors of Children, Young People and Families. Mr Hay, who was in charge until 2006, before returning to oversee the department in 2013, said at the time of Keanu's death the council had been going through \\"an eight-year period of sustained failure\\" in spite of the previous warnings. Ofsted branded the service a \\"national disgrace\\" after the boy's death. The government warned the authority it was considering taking over the running of the department, but instead appointed Lord Warner. 23 Serious case reviews in Birmingham since 2006 7 Years Birmingham children's services has been rated inadequate Â£9.2m Pledged by the city council in 2014 to improve the department 161 Social worker posts unfilled by permanent staff in January Four months after he started, a new, integrated agency hub was created to speed up the safeguarding process. Birmingham Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (Mash) is based inside the council's headquarters and is made up of many organisations, including police, social workers and the NHS. Christine Wellington, Mash head of service, said: \\"Pre-Mash there was no feedback, there was almost the sense of 'what's the point of referring if nothing is going to be done?'.\\" Now, when a safeguarding call comes in, it takes priority and the various agencies get together to discuss what action to take. But one social worker who has worked for the council on more than one occasion - in 2012 and again this year - said his experiences had put him off going back. The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, said during his most recent time there, managers were being sacked, asked to leave and resigning, on a weekly basis. He said he was \\"fearful of a child death or a serious incident happening on my watch and I want to be able to sleep at night\\". The council has said a recruitment crisis in the department has been turned around - in contrast to May last year, when more than a quarter of frontline social worker posts were unfilled. Social worker Siobhan Patton said her case load is the lowest it has ever been, down from 30 to 10. And she said that was a big change from her \\"lowest point\\" - working from 06:00 until midnight. Despite the council having to save millions of pounds from several departments, the authority has invested Â£30m in children's services over the past two years, which Mr Hay said was \\"a real sign of that commitment to make this the number one service the council provides\\".

She was taken into care, which means she was looked after by the government, when she was 11 because she had marks on her back from a belt. But things didn't go well for her there. She had to move around 39 times in just five years and some very very bad things happened to her. The guy in charge of making sure children like Danielle are safe in the city of Birmingham was called Mr. Hay. However, even though he was trying to make things better, there were still some big problems and other kids also suffered. The government said they were thinking about taking over the job of looking after these services from Mr. Hay and the other leaders in Birmingham. Instead of doing that, they chose Lord Warner, another important guy, to help out. Now, they have a new way of doing things called 'Mash' in Birmingham. Different groups like the police and health care workers come together to talk about what they can do to help when a call about the safety of a child comes in. But, some people who work there don't think things are going well and are worried something bad could happen. At one point, they didn't even have enough social workers, who are people that help children in need. Things seem to be better now, with less work for each social worker. As for the money part, the leaders have put more money into these services, which is a good sign that they're trying to make things better for children. The news report about these children's services is available on the internet for everyone to watch."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

According to this friend, Bryan Mytko, the NYC-based programmer who claims to have purchased the restaurant's domain after Fieri \\"forgot\\" to, is a \\"dick\\" for not bothering to credit Pauline Vassiliadis with having actually designed the uproarious menu that is making everyone ROTFLTAO. But it seems the dick hole goes even deeper than that. Late last night, \\"weird twitter\\" ambassador @boring_as_heck noted that many of the jokes that appear on the faux-menu have been lifted wholesale from various Twitter accounts. A more detailed assessment of the plagiarism accusation by @a_girl_irl shows that approximately 50% of all the yucks were \\"borrowed\\" from a just one Twitter account: @DinkMagic. \\"[M]aking fun of guy fieri is literally the easiest thing on earth to do and that guy just ripped people off instead,\\" @DinkMagic tweeted after the intellectual theft was brought to their attention. For his part, Mytko released a statement (since deleted, but still online) asserting that he didn't bother mentioning Vassiliadis initially because \\"she doesn't have twitter,\\" and also didn't think his prank would blow up as big as it did. He continues: I barely use Twitter and have no idea who @DadBoner @a_girl_irl @DinkMagic @Lowenaffchen etc. are. If any of the content was stolen from them, well, I have no idea what to tell you. Laugh at the menu or don't. There are more important things to stress over in life than Twitter. Back on his Twitter feed, Mytko concluded a night of responding to aggrieved joke authors and their supporters by saying, \\"and I hope all you haters picked up a few followers to help fill that empty void in your soul.\\" Vassiliadis has been reached for comment, but has yet to respond. This post will be updated if and when she does.

Article: Isabella Stewart was born in New York City in 1840. Her father made a great deal of money in trade. During school,her parents took her to Italy to explore the country's many cultural treasures. One of the private art collections Isabella visited in Milan had a deep influence on her. She wrote to her friends about her dream of owning a house one day with an art collection like the one she had seen in Italy. In Paris, Isabella became a close friend of one of her classmates, Julia Gardner, whose family was from Boston. Julia would later introduce Isabella to her brother, Jack. In 1860, Isabella Stewart married Jack Gardner. The couple had too much art to fit inside their home. So they decided to start planning a museum. Mrs. Gardner didn't like the cold and empty spaces of many museums during her time. She wanted a warm museum filled with light. She once said that she decided years ago that _ . America was a young country developing quickly in other areas. But the country needed more chances for people to see beautiful examples of art. After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston. In her will, she left the museum a million dollars and a series of requirements about how it should be managed. One requirement is that the permanent collection cannot be changed.

She also is a principal at the Baker Wright Group, a communications and public relations firm. You can follow her on Twitter @GOPBlackChick. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. That was the Republican Party's own take on the 2012 election as it acknowledged in an autopsy report (otherwise known as the Growth & Opportunity Project) that it was failing to appeal to minority voters. Unfortunately, too many Republicans have already forgotten this lesson, a reality made all the clearer by the response to recent revelations that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise spoke to a white supremacist group 12 years ago. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was just one of those who seemed more interested in making excuses than holding Republicans to the standard they had supposedly set for themselves. Appearing on CBS' \\"Face the Nation,\\" Gingrich brushed off the accusations, suggesting it was a \\"stupidly\\" scheduled meeting, while noting that President Barack Obama attended the church of the racially divisive Rev. Jeremiah Wright for 20 years. Gingrich also attempted to pivot to the media's treatment of Democrats with racist records. \\"You have (Sen. Robert) Byrd who was the majority leader and a Klan leader. You have Hugo Black, who was a justice, who was a Klan leader. But they were Democrats and being in the Klan was OK,\\" Gingrich lectured. Actually, none of that was OK. But this isn't about Democrats -- it's about the racist undercurrent that has been corrupting the GOP for decades, and the fact that the party's establishment has too often looked the other way. Unfortunately, it feels like every time a Republican is caught behaving like a racist in the 21st century, prominent members of the GOP try to change the subject to Democrats behaving badly instead of denouncing what is going on. What exactly did Scalise do to deserve the opprobrium that critics have justifiably heaped on him? Well, in 2002, as a Louisiana state representative, Scalise spoke to the European-American Unity and Rights Organization, founded by former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke. Scalise alleges a staffer scheduled the appearance and that he wasn't aware of the group's, uh, \\"divisive racial and religious views,\\" as he wrote in a statement. Yet Scalise's claims of plausible deniability just don't add up. Exclusive: Duke threatens to name names 00:33 For a start, The Washington Post reported that Kenny Knight, his neighbor at the time and a longtime Duke adviser, requested Scalise speak to the group and said Scalise \\"knew who I was, but I don't think he held it against me.\\" But we don't even need to look to someone else's take to get a feel for Scalise's past. In 1999, Scalise reportedly told Roll Call he shared Duke's \\"conservative\\" views but said that \\"the novelty of David Duke has worn off.\\" More recently, in 2004, Scalise voted against declaring a state holiday honoring civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Collectively, these actions don't look like those of an elected official who rejects \\"that kind of hateful bigotry,\\" as Scalise noted in his statement, but instead suggest a man trying to play politics in a state where only 13% of his congressional district's residents are black. Gingrich also told \\"Face the Nation\\" host Bob Schieffer that Mia B. Love, the first black Republican woman elected to Congress, had said Scalise has been \\"helpful\\" to her, as if this somehow negates what Scalise has done. But isn't helping out a fellow member of the GOP a pretty basic requirement of the job for someone in a leadership position? House speaker, Louisiana Democrat back Scalise 03:52 I admire Love, but the truth is that as a black woman myself, I have no idea how she could say on ABC's \\"This Week\\" that she believes Scalise \\"should remain in leadership,\\" particularly since Love doesn't appear to have had experience working directly with him. Perhaps Love was trying to show the GOP she's a team player, but she didn't do herself or the party any favors by standing by a colleague who spoke to a group whose membership would no doubt be happy if segregation had never ended. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Scalise made a \\"mistake.\\" Speaker John Boehner, for his part, called it an \\"error of judgment\\" and added that Scalise has his \\"full confidence.\\" As a black Republican, I'm tired of my party continuing to provide safe harbor to people like Scalise. Gingrich complained the media's coverage of Scalise's speech was \\"a one-sided view of reality.\\" Actually, that sounds more like a description of the GOP today. The face of the party looks as intolerant as ever as 2015 begins. Unless it starts showing \\"representatives\\" like Scalise the door, it will find itself writing another autopsy report in 2016.

If Today, a visit to the quarries, just outside town, reveals some of the secrets of how the ancient Egyptians worked the stone., can we conclude that \\"The Egyptians stonework has been one of the best kept secrets in the world, their methods still unknown.\\"?","completion":"While your statement might lend an air of mystery and intrigue to ancient Egyptian stonework, it's not entirely accurate based on current archeological knowledge and understanding. The prowess of ancient Egyptians in stonework is indeed impressive, marveled at through the ages, and is a subject of many studies. Their accomplishments have stood the test of time and are visible today in the grand edifices such as the Great Pyramids, Sphinx, Obelisks, statues, and more. Although the processes and methods they used in achieving such an extraordinary level of precision and imagination in their stonework may have been initially shrouded in mystery, archaeological findings, rigorous studies, and scientific developments over years have allowed us to uncover several of their methods. Visiting the ancient quarries can certainly provide insight into how they extracted and shaped the stones. The archaeological evidence, such as the remains of tools, quarry marks, and cut-stone waste in the quarry area, help reconstruct the process of stone extraction and initial shaping. It is believed that they used tools such as hardened bronze and copper chisels, as well as a technique known as \\"fire-setting\\" wherein they would light a fire to heat the rock, then quickly cool it with water, making it far easier to break apart. Moreover, detailed studies on the ancient structures, aided by modern techniques like microscopy, chemical analysis, and geology, have offered further clarity. For instance, it is now understood that the Egyptians employed a unique method to transport the massive blocks of limestone and granite. They most likely used large sledges which were dragged over wet sand, significantly reducing the friction and making transportation of such large weights feasible. While the construction techniques from the Pyramids built around 2600 BC might not be entirely understood, the later monuments like the temples constructed during the New Kingdom period (around 1550 – 1069 BC) are better understood due to the preservation of more extensive resources and tools. Additionally, various pieces of evidence in ancient Egyptian textual material, including inscriptions, paintings, and papyri, provide further insight into their construction methods. For instance, the illustrations in the tomb of Rekhmire, a vizier during the reign of Thutmose III, distinctly represent a scene of stone-cutting. However, it is important to note that while scholars are confident about these discovered methods, some secrets of the ancient Egyptians' stonework do remain a mystery due to the lack of comprehensive and written records detailing the exact methods. The limitations in replicating the precision and finesse of their work with same ancient techniques also add to the mystery. Therefore, these points might lend some credibility to your statement. In conclusion, while we have managed to uncover a significant amount regarding ancient Egyptian stonework techniques, there are aspects of their practices that remain as yet undiscovered, keeping the intrigue alive. However, it wouldn't be entirely accurate to term it as \\"one of the best kept secrets\\" due to the considerable progress made in understanding their techniques. This field is an area of ongoing research and interpretations, and every new archaeological discovery adds a bit more to our understanding of their extraordinary skills. Overall, continuing to explore and analyze Egypt’s ancient quarries and structures is certain to further enhance our knowledge of the ancient Egyptians' advanced construction skills and practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you're standing in the rain at the bus stop tomorrow morning, trying to get to work, and if, in the downpour, you should notice that waiting patiently for the bus with you is Bill Gates. . . . Or if you're in a long line at the convenience store, waiting to buy a lottery ticket in the hopes of striking it rich, and you see that the equally hopeful person in front of you in the Powerball line is Mr. Gates. . . . Will you please ask him something? Will you ask him about Winky Dink? We'll get back to Mr. Gates in a moment. He is, as you probably know, one of the world's wealthiest and most influential men. As the co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, he has had vast influence on the way we live -- particularly in the way that screens, and our constant interaction with them, have taken over everything. Which brings us to Winky Dink. A strong case can be made -- and several authors, deep thinkers and historians over the years have made it -- that Winky Dink, more than any other single person (or single cartoon character, in Winky Dink's case), ushered in the era of interactivity. In the early day of television, Americans sat transfixed as the first sets were delivered to homes. The brand-new experience was like having a constantly programmed movie screen in the family living room. The pleasure, the convenience-- all a person had to do was lean back and be entertained. Or so it seemed. But two men -- a pair of fledgling television producers whose names were Harry Prichett and Edwin Wyckoff -- had the foresight to realize that the screen did not necessarily have to be one-way. And that there was money to be made by encouraging people to treat the screen as something with which they could interact. Thus was born \\"Winky Dink and You\\" -- a primitive and rudimentary first step into what would eventually become the screen-obsessed world in which we live today: millions of people endlessly tapping away, sending and receiving messages, relentlessly responding to what glows in front of their eyes, regarding their screen as almost a person, a friend. \\"Winky Dink and You,\\" which aired Saturday mornings on CBS beginning in 1953, was hosted by Jack Barry and starred a sprightly, squeaky-voiced cartoon character named. . .well, you know what he was named. Winky Dink's adventures were not all that spectacular -- but it is what he asked the children watching the show to do that heralded a cultural change. Winky Dink said he wanted the children to mail away for a \\"Magic Window,\\" which was actually a cheaply produced, thin sheet of plastic that adhered to the TV screen by static electricity. \\"Send your name and address, along with 50 cents, to Winky Dink, Box 5, New York, 19, New York!\\" Those incessantly repeated words became one of the most familiar phrases in the land. Along with the plastic sheet that arrived in the mail were \\"magic crayons.\\" Children were encouraged to place the sheet on their TV screen and watch the show each Saturday, so that Winky Dink could tell them what to do. They might be instructed to draw a ladder on a certain part of the sheet, or a chimney, or a bridge. Then the action on the television screen would combine with what the children had drawn on the plastic sheet to create a narrative-in-motion. It was a sensation, for a while. Children who didn't own the magic sheet or the magic crayons felt left out -- they could watch the show, but they weren't participating in the whole experience. Winky Dink guilted them into sending in the 50 cents so they weren't deprived of what every other kid on the block was doing. The show's downfall derived from two things. According to author Billy Ingram, perhaps the world's leading Winky Dink authority, many children who didn't own the plastic sheets simply took crayons they had around the house and, on Winky Dink's cue, drew directly on the glass screens of their parents' expensive first-generation television sets. And if that didn't make the parents angry enough, there was the concern that the children, by sitting so close to the TV sets as they drew, could be exposing themselves to harmful radiation. The original show went off the air in 1957, and although there were short-lived attempts to revive it, it is now just a distant memory. But Winky Dink's influence lives on in every screen that every person today regards as a two-way window. Which brings us to Bill Gates. There is a line that occasionally pops up in Winky Dink-related literature. The line quotes Gates -- it has him crediting \\"Winky Dink and You\\" as \\"the first interactive TV show.\\" It certainly would make sense. Gates and his Windows are the logical extension of Winky Dink and his Magic Window. Winky Dink and Gates both saw the true back-and-forth possibilities of those screens. What Gates has accomplished is essentially Winky Dink writ large. Very large. But, try as I might, I was unable to locate a reliable, rock-solid citation for that quote. Was is it real -- had Gates ever actually uttered the words? Or was it merely some tall tale, repeated person-to-person by would-be believers? I contacted the Microsoft corporate offices to ask if they could verify, for the sake of posterity, that Gates had, in fact, once sung the praises of Winky Dink. I had some false starts and hit some dead ends. But then, paydirt. I was able to get in touch with a man by the name of John Pinette, who once worked for Microsoft and who now is a spokesman for Gates himself. Pinette said he had a distinct recollection of having been present at the key moment:. \\"I remember the Winky Dink speech -- but don't remember when Bill gave it (or where -- or to whom). It was a brief example of 'here's an early example of interactive TV' before he went on to a bigger presentation of Microsoft's TV efforts. \\"He had one of the plastic film sheets -- and the Winky Dink box, if I remember correctly.\\" So there it is. Gates was born in 1955, so it is unlikely that he remembers watching in first-run the original version of \\"Winky Dink and You.\\" Perhaps he saw the subsequent attempts to bring the show back; perhaps, like so many young Americans of the time, he simply found himself awash in the echoes of Winky's legend. Every creative genius is influenced by someone. Plato was influenced by Socrates. Beethoven was influenced by Mozart. William Faulkner was influenced by Mark Twain. In some future century, a new Mount Rushmore may be carved, to celebrate the figures of our own era who changed the course of the world as dramatically as any presidents or statesmen.

Step 2: Consider the hypothesis The hypothesis is that policies like capital-gains and estate-tax cuts are generally geared towards benefiting the rich. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, both discuss the effects of capital-gains and estate-tax cuts on the well-to-do population, but the hypothesis is a broader generalization that policies of that nature are primarily geared towards benefiting the rich. Step 4: Assess the relationship between the premise and hypothesis The premise supports the hypothesis by providing an example of how specific types of tax cuts (capital-gains and estate-tax cuts) will favor the well-to-do in the long run. This indicates that at least some of these types of policies are designed to benefit the wealthier population. Step 5: Evaluate the hypothesis Based on the premise, it is reasonable to consider that the hypothesis could be true. However, it's important to note that the premise only highlights \\"almost any sort\\" of these tax cuts. It leaves the possibility that there might be exceptions or that not all similar policies are geared towards benefiting the rich. While there seems to be a trend, the hypothesis might be a generalized statement and not applicable in all cases. Conclusion: The premise supports the hypothesis, indicating that capital-gains and estate-tax cuts of almost any sort will favor the well-to-do in the long run. However, the hypothesis might be too generalized and not address every instance. It is still reasonable to say that, based on the provided premise, the hypothesis is likely to be true in many cases but might not be universally true for all such policies."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

The second premise is \\"Women are shaving.\\" The context is that some women are currently shaving - it does not specify what they are shaving or where they are. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises We need to analyze if the second premise affects the truth value of the first premise. In other words, does the fact that some women are shaving affect the reality that two men are shaving their faces while a woman watches? Step 3: Determine if the premises are connected The two premises seem to be unrelated as the first premise involves a specific situation with specific individuals, while the second premise is a general statement which involves an unspecified number of women and does not specify what or where they are shaving. Since the second premise does not provide information about the woman who is watching the two men shave, we cannot determine any direct connection between the two premises. Step 4: Determine the truth value of the first premise Given that the second premise does not provide any direct information about the woman in the first premise, we cannot conclude that her actions (watching the men shave) are affected by the fact that some women are shaving. As a result, the truth value of the first premise remains unaltered by the second premise.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A young child is sleeping on a man's coat on the floor.\\" if \\"A kid is sleeping on a coat in the waiting room of the dentist.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the statement, \\"A kid is sleeping on a coat in the waiting room of the dentist,\\" it is possible, but not certain, to conclude that \\"A young child is sleeping on a man's coat on the floor.\\" We can evaluate the similarities and differences between the two statements in order to assess this possibility. 1. Age of the person sleeping on the coat: Both statements describe a young individual as the subject. In the first statement, it is referred to as a \\"young child,\\" while in the second statement, it is referred to as a \\"kid.\\" Although both terms typically describe young individuals, there might be slight variations in their age range. Nonetheless, since the terms overlap in their general age descriptions, this part of the two statements aligns. 2. Location of the person sleeping on the coat: In both statements, the individual is sleeping on a coat. However, the specific location is different. In the first statement, there is no information on the setting, whereas, in the second statement, the location is explicitly mentioned as the waiting room of the dentist. Although the locations differ, it is not impossible for the first statement to occur within a dentist's waiting room. Therefore, the location could align, but it is not explicitly clear. 3. Ownership of the coat: The first statement mentions that the coat is a \\"man's coat,\\" while the second statement does not provide any information about the owner of the coat. It is plausible to think that the coat in the dentist's waiting room could belong to a man, but there is no definite information in the second statement to confirm this. Thus, this part may or may not align based on the given statements. 4. Position of the coat and child: In both statements, it is implied that the coat is on the floor since the child is sleeping on it. This assumption is based on the common understanding that a person would sleep on a coat when it is spread out on the floor rather than on a surface like a chair or table. So, it can be concluded that the coat is on the floor in both situations. In summary, certain aspects of the two statements align well, such as the age of the individual and the coat's position on the floor. Other aspects, like the specific location and ownership of the coat, have more ambiguity due to the lack of explicit information in the statements. While it is indeed possible to conclude that \\"A young child is sleeping on a man's coat on the floor,\\" based on the information given, it is important to keep the uncertainties in mind and not conclude this as an absolute certainty."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There could be several reasons why a worker is fixing the wall, and it might not necessarily be related to the door. Some possible scenarios for why the worker is fixing the wall might include: 1. General maintenance or repair: The worker may be performing routine maintenance or repair on the wall that has nothing to do with the door. 2. Aesthetic improvements: The worker could be fixing the wall as a part of a renovation project, where the objective is to beautify or modernize the area. 3. Wall damage unrelated to the door: There could be a damage to the wall due to factors unrelated to the door, such as impacts, cracking, dampness, or any other reason. 4. Structural issues: The wall may require fixing due to structural issues not related to the door, such as foundation settling, or addressing problems with insulation or wiring.

Don't let it get too loud though, or you might wake the host's parents. Take turns using headphones if you have to. This will make the night drag on, and it seems like it will never reach the end of that night. Pay attention to what your friends are doing or talking about instead. The more fun you have, the faster time will seem to pass. Make a rule where if anybody sees anybody else start to fade off, or look drowsy, they can give them a small pinch in the arm or shake them awake. If you see your friends looking drowsy, suggest a change in activities.

Keith was measuring the attributes of thermoclines. He selected two locations. One is near Miami, which is in the tropic. The other is near New York, which is in higher latitude. In total, he took four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. From Miami thermocline he took sample A. Then from below Miami thermocline he took sample B. From New York thermocline he took sample C. Finally, from below New York thermocline he took sample D. Hint: If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C.

The answer is:","completion":"The term that provides a career description that matches the brothers Louis and Nathan Thompson is \\"pioneering aeronautical engineers and inventors.\\" Louis and Nathan Thompson were distinguished figures in the field of aviation during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, making significant contributions to the development of lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air flight technologies. Born in the 1860s, Louis and Nathan Thompson's interest in flight started at a young age. They began their careers with numerous experiments in building and flying large kites and gliders, which laid the groundwork for their future aeronautical innovations. Their dedication to the principles of aerodynamics and aircraft control systems became evident as they shifted their attention to developing powered aircraft. Their innovative work in this field led to the design and construction of several early aircraft prototypes. The Thompson brothers' contributions to aviation also included developments in airship design. These innovations played a crucial role in the growth of commercial and military aviation during the first half of the 20th century. Some notable accomplishments by the Thompson brothers include: 1. Pioneering the development of ailerons, which are adjustable control surfaces on the wings of airplanes. Ailerons enable lateral (rolling) control of the aircraft, making it possible for pilots to execute turns and bank maneuvers with greater precision. 2. Creating innovative airship designs featuring streamlined, aerodynamic shapes which allowed for increased speed and maneuverability. Their airship models significantly influenced the subsequent designs of blimps and zeppelins. 3. Developing an early wind tunnel, a valuable tool that is now essential for the study of aerodynamics and aircraft design. Their wind tunnel enabled them to test various airfoil shapes, control surfaces, and other components that would ultimately influence the design of future aircraft. 4. Creating novel control systems for aircraft and airships that allowed for increased stability and responsiveness during flight. Their work in refining and implementing these cutting-edge control systems led to a more precise and manageable flight experience for pilots. The Thompson brothers' combined efforts and achievements in the field of aeronautical engineering and invention demonstrate their profound influence on the development of aviation. Their careers as pioneering aeronautical engineers and inventors helped shape the future of air travel and have left a lasting impact on the industry as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Answer:","completion":"To determine which test saw higher concentrations of the products, we should first understand the basics of Le Châtelier's principle and the effect of stress on a chemical system in equilibrium. Le Châtelier's principle states that when a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure (i.e., stress), the system will respond by shifting the position of the equilibrium to counteract the change and re-establish the initial equilibrium. This involves either the forward or reverse reaction being favored. Here's a summary of each test: - Test A: No stress - Test B: Stress applied - Test C: Forward reaction observed - Test D: Reverse reaction observed Test A does not provide any useful information since no stress was applied to the system in equilibrium. In test B, stress was applied to the system. This stress caused the system to undergo some change, leading to either the forward or reverse reaction being favored. In test C, the forward reaction was observed, which means the stress applied in test B resulted in an increase in product concentrations. The system adjusted itself by forming more products to counteract the stress and re-establish equilibrium. In test D, the reverse reaction was observed, which means the stress applied led to a decrease in product concentrations. The system adjusted itself by consuming more products and forming more reactants to counteract the stress and re-establish equilibrium. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that test C saw higher concentrations of the products compared to test D, as the forward reaction increased product concentrations, whereas the reverse reaction in test D decreased product concentrations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The new duty pleases his girlfriend, May, who is glad that her boyfriend is no longer taking difficult cases and has more time to see her.However, the happy mood changes when Ka-Kui is greeted by Chu Tao and his bespectacled right-hand man John Ko. It seems Chu Tao is terminally ill with only three months left to live, so he's been released from prison, and while he's still alive he vows to make life difficult for Ka-Kui. John Ko and some henchmen show up at Ka Kui's apartment and intimidate him, baiting the policeman to attack. Later, May and her mother are beaten by John Ko and his men.

A bomb does indeed explode, and the entire mall is leveled by the blast.Ka-Kui is praised for his efforts, and he is reinstated and assigned to solve the case of the bombing. Ka-Kui plants a covert listening device in the mall property company's office to try and learn more about the bombers.

Question: Percival Lowell established the observatory after what American astronomer that discovered Pluto in 1930? Answer:","completion":"Actually, your question seems to have a slight confusion regarding the individuals and timeline involved in the discovery of Pluto. Percival Lowell did establish the Lowell Observatory, however, it was not after but before the discovery of Pluto. His primary goal in setting up the observatory was the study of Mars and his personally held belief that there were canals on Mars, an indication of intelligent life. Quite notably, he also initiated systematic searches for a planet beyond Neptune, often referred to as “Planet X.” It's Clyde W. Tombaugh, an astronomer at Lowell Observatory, who is credited with the discovery of Pluto in 1930. The discovery was made nearly fifteen years post Percival Lowell's death. Lowell had been driven by a belief that discrepancies in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune could be explained by an unknown ninth planet. Although Pluto turned out not to be the Planet X that Lowell hypothesized, the powerful legacy of Lowell's passionate engagement with astronomy undoubtedly fueled the drive for exploration and discovery at the Lowell Observatory. As for your question, it might be more accurate to rephrase it as follows: \\"Percival Lowell established the observatory which later on employed which American astronomer that discovered Pluto in 1930?\\" And the answer would be: Clyde W. Tombaugh. In sum, Percival Lowell played a critical role in promoting advanced study of our solar system by establishing the observatory where, years after his death, Clyde W.

No. The statement you provided, \\"The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there,\\" is not the correct answer. The Stamp Act Congress was indeed an important gathering of colonial representatives that took place in response to the Stamp Act imposed by the British Parliament in 1765. However, it was not a trial, and its primary focus was on protesting against taxation without representation rather than addressing freedom of the press. The trial that helped establish the right of freedom of the press in Manhattan was the 1735 trial of John Peter Zenger. This historical trial took place in the then-British colony of New York, which would later become Manhattan, New York City. John Peter Zenger was a German-American printer and journalist who operated a newspaper called the New York Weekly Journal. In his newspaper, Zenger published articles that criticized the colonial governor, William Cosby, and accused him of corruption and abuse of power. As a result, Zenger was arrested and charged with libel, which was then considered a criminal offense. During the trial, Zenger's defense attorney, Andrew Hamilton, argued that the accusations published in Zenger's newspaper were factual and that truth should be an absolute defense in libel cases. The jury agreed with Hamilton's argument and acquitted Zenger, establishing the critical precedent that truthful publications criticizing the government should be protected under the principle of freedom of the press. This landmark trial later served as a foundation for the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of the press among other fundamental rights. The Zenger trial was a crucial turning point that contributed to the development of the free press in America, helping to promote democracy and protect citizens' right to express their opinions and criticisms of public figures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A wild police chase in Washington ended bizarrely when a man crashed a stolen RV into several cars and a home then got out of the vehicle and stripped to his underwear before running into a home and donning female clothing. Snohomish County deputies say 33-year-old James M Johns was spotted driving a motor home that had been reported stolen early Tuesday morning at a Walmart in South Everett. Everett police, Washington State Patrol troopers and Snohomish deputies were all involved in an hour-long chase after repeated attempts to pull Johns over failed. Suspect: James Johns, 33, was arrested after leading police on a wild chase and crashing into cars and homes. Wild chase: The RV was reported stolen Tuesday morning and spotted that afternoon, when a chase involving up to 20 police vehicles ensued. Damage: This car was mangled after Johns hit it with the SUV, setting off a chain reaction of crashes. The. out-of-control driver reportedly swerved into the path of an oncoming. police car, narrowly missing it, and almost hit a jogger and three girls. with a horse. Johns. eventually drove the vehicle to Granite Falls, where it slammed into a. car, which in turn launched another car into the front of Gary Poplin's. home. 'I'm just glad it hit the telephone pole first otherwise I wouldn't have a bedroom,' Poplin told Kiro TV. The. RV didn't stop there. It hit another car and broke through Poplin's. fence before taking out the corner of Juliane Rowell's home and smashing. three more cars. Lucky escape: The driver of one of the vehicles Johns hit was taken to hospital with injuries but police say no one was seriously hurt. Damage: The fence of this home was mowed down by Johns in the RV, and the home was also damaged. Rowell says she was upstairs when the incident happened. 'Then my son started yelling, \\"Mom, Mom, you can't believe this: someone ran into our house!\\"' she told Kiro TV. After the RV finally came to a stop, witnesses say Johns jumped out and began running, shedding clothing as he went. He ran into a home in his underwear, encountered a group of people inside and demanded they give him clothing to disguise himself from the police. They refused and ran outside before calling the police. Out of control: Johns reportedly hit a car which ran into a telephone pole before hitting Gary Poplin's home. Neighborhood in shock: All in all, five cars and two houses were damaged in Johns's rampage. Deputies were not far away and arrived just moments later. 'He had about 15 or 20 cop cars chasing him,' a witness told KOMO. Deputies removed Johns from the house, reports Kiro TV, where he had managed to don a pair of women's jeans and a women's T-shirt. 'He started putting on girl clothes,' one witness told KOMO. 'And then the cops came and grabbed him and brought him out and he was still wearing the girl clothes.'

The Steelers stayed home for a 3-game home stand and for a Sunday Night duel against the Ravens. The Ravens scored first when Joe Flacco hooked up with Torrey Smith 35-yard TD pass to take a 7-0 lead for the only score of the first quarter. In the 2nd quarter, the Steelers managed to tie the game up when Ben Roethlisberger found Le'Veon Bell on a 5-yard TD pass for a 7-7 game. They eventually took the lead when Roethlisberger found Martavis Bryant on a 19-yard TD pass to make it a 14-7 game.

Objective: To prevent your cell phone from ringing during a meeting, Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"Both solutions offer their unique perspectives in terms of naive physics reasoning. However, to determine which solution is more sound, we need to first explore the concept of naive physics reasoning. Naive physics reasoning is the understanding and interpretation of the physical world based on common sense and everyday experiences rather than formal scientific knowledge. It is a way of looking at how things work in the real world without being informed by scientific theories. When considering solutions to a problem, naive physics reasoning prioritizes practicality, simplicity, and intuitiveness. Now let us examine the two solutions: 1. Wrapping the phone in a cloth or any sound-absorbing material. 2. Burying the phone in a pile of sand. Solution 1: Wrapping the phone in a cloth or any sound-absorbing material In this solution, the rationale lies in minimizing the sound emitted by the phone by using a material that readily absorbs sound. Materials like cloth, foam, sponge, or paper can be used for this purpose, as they possess the properties to dampen vibrations and muffle the sound. This method is practical and relatively easy to implement for anyone. Moreover, it doesn't require any special resources and can be executed in any environment, even during a meeting. However, this approach may not completely silence the phone; it can only muffle or reduce the loudness to some extent, depending on the sound-absorbing material used. Additionally, there would also be a risk of missing notifications or important calls, as the phone's ringer might be blocked or muffled to the point of being inaudible. Solution 2: Burying the phone in a pile of sand In this solution, the idea is to use sand to block or attenuate the sound emitted by the phone. Sand forms a barrier around the phone, which could impede sound transmission to a significant extent due to the distortion of sound waves. Sand particles may also absorb some of the sound being generated, hence reducing the noise level. By doing so, it might be possible that the phone's ringing could be blocked or significantly muffled. Despite the notion being considered in the realm of naive physics reasoning, this method might not be practical in most scenarios. One of the obvious concerns being the unavailability of a pile of sand in typical meeting environments. Moreover, burying a phone in sand may cause potential damage to the device, risk of dust or sand particles entering the phone, or pose difficulty in retrieving it when needed. Conclusion: Based on the analysis above, it can be concluded that wrapping the phone in a cloth or any sound-absorbing material is a more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. This method is practical, easily implementable, and can be executed in a variety of settings without any major drawbacks. While burying the phone in a pile of sand might offer some naive physics merit, its impracticality and potential risks make it less favorable and less sound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No major injuries were reported. Lisa Beaulieu, of Enfield, was driving along Mountain Road in Suffield near Ratley Road about 3 p.m. when a telephone pole adjacent to the road cracked and came tumbling down in front of her car, police said. \\"She was unable to avoid it,\\" said Suffield Police Chief Richard Brown. \\"The car got tangled up in the telephone wire.\\" Brown explained that because a tree had fallen on a support wire for the telephone pole, it came crashing down, and the front wheels of the car got tangled in the telephone wire, pulling Beaulieu's car up off the road. With two front tires suspended off the road as her car dangled, Beaulieu, who was in the car with her son, called for help at 3:07 p.m, Brown said.

Within a matter of seconds I saw smoke billowing out,\\" he said. \\"I had to take a second look just to make sure it was real. I ran outside to see it better and sure enough, there were flames.\\" Macci said he called 911 at 4:31 p.m. and the fire department rushed to the two-story home on 15 Stanford Road, which belongs to Christopher and Rhonda Day. \\"The neighbor across the street made a quick call,\\" said Manchester Fire Chief Dave Billings. \\"That's what saved these people's house.\\" With six inches of water rushing down the road, Billings said firefighters had to pull the heavy hose through the water in order to put out the house fire. \\"There was literally a river running down the street,\\" he said. \\"[The firefighters] were all really tired afterward.\\" The lightning hit the right rear corner of the roof, \\"blew a big hole in the back of the house\\" and set fire to a second floor bedroom, which was contained by 5:03 p.m., according to Billings. The house was saved and the only damage is in the bedroom, Billings said. \\"It was fortunate that the neighbor was watching the storm, because it was raining so hard, no one would have seen any indication of the fire until it was much more advanced,\\" he said. Though the storm was only in town for about 90 minutes, Billings said within that timeframe, while they were also dealing with the house fire, the department received 35 calls for storm-related incidents such as motor vehicle accidents, flooded homes, tree limbs hitting houses, wires going down, and manhole covers blowing up off the street due to the water pressure. \\"It was a busy day,\\" Billings said. \\"It got crazy for about two hours.\\" No one was inside the house at the time of the fire, and the Days' black cat named Jack was rescued, according to Macci. \\"Obviously it was a bad situation but it could've been a lot worse,\\" he said In Cornwall, one road, Route 125, remained closed Thursday due to the significant amount of damage to the road, according to Kevin Nursick, a spokesperson for the State Department of Transportation. Nursick said the road literally washed away, leaving rubble and exposed patches of dirt along a section of the road in between Route 4 and Dibble Hill Road. \\"In certain locations when we have heavy rain events, the geography and topography coupled with the soil's inability to absorb water, means the location is conducive to flash-flood effects,\\" Nursick said. The state Department of Transportation is still assessing the area, Nursick said, but he said it's likely that they'll need to pave the road over again. \\"Water was traveling over, under and around the road,\\" he said. \\"It's that high velocity water that'll erode everything, including the asphalt.\\" Conditions like these make it dangerous to drive on flooded roads, Nursick said, and he warned to avoid situations like this when driving in a storm. Another road that flooded during the storm, according to Cromwell Police Chief Denise Lamontagne was South Street in Cromwell. The section of the road between Main Street and Ranney Street was flooded and closed during the storm, but was able to reopen with no damage afterward, according to Lamontagne. \\"This is pretty typical when there's a heavy rain in a short time period,\\" she said. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video SUFFIELD -- A mother from Suffield is thanking the first responders who helped her and her children out of their car after an unusual accident during Wednesday’s storm. Lisa Beaulieu told FOX61 she was driving home from her mother-in-law’s house with her two young children, ages 4 and 5, when the storm hit abruptly. “I never anticipated it would get that bad,” she said. When she reached Mountain Road in Suffield, she said she saw some debris falling from a tree up ahead, which caused a telephone pole to snap toward its top. “At that point, we were pretty much right underneath it,” said Beaulieu. She explained, “What we didn’t know at the time was that there was a wire still attached to it.” Beaulieu said the wire somehow got lodged underneath her car and lifted them into the air. All three of them were OK but trapped. She called 911 from the car and said the dispatcher stayed with her on the phone the whole time. Emergency crews from Suffield responded, along with Eversource to make sure that wire wasn’t live. Eventually, they were able to open the doors and carry the children out safely. Then they brought a ladder over to Beaulieu’s side and helped her out that way. In all, they were in that car balancing on its rear bumper for around 45 minutes. “I was panicking but I did understand obviously,” she said. “They knew that we were in the car. I knew that we were safe.” Beaulieu said, “The dispatcher was amazing, the firefighters, everybody that approached us and helped us out made my kids feel very safe. The EMS team that took us out of the scene were so, so good with my kids. They just made us feel so calm and safe, and so that made the situation better.” ||||| A Suffield mother and her children were trapped in a car after it became entangled by electrical wires during a storm.

Beaulieu drove over the power lines which reeled her vehicle into the air. Their car dangled over Mountain Road until rescuers could come free them. \\"I prayed the entire time we were in the car. I prayed please don't let lightning hit us, please don't let the car shift,\\" Beaulieu said. The mother waited for help inside the car with her 5-year-old son Drew and her 4-year-old daughter Noella. The mother called 911 and the operator remained on the line until help arrived. When help did arrive, Drew was the first to see them because he could see out the back window. \\"I cleaned the window off and started crying for the firefighters,\\" said the 5-year-old boy said. More than 40 minutes later, the Beaulieu family was free and unharmed.

Therefore, this option is incorrect. 2) It is not possible to tell This option suggests that it is unclear if the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided. The premise states that there is a pub and a restaurant, which means two businesses exist. Meanwhile, the hypothesis posits that there are zero businesses. Given this contradiction, it is quite clear that the hypothesis is not true if the premise is true, so this option is not correct either. 3) No This option denotes that if the premise (Pub, Restaurant) is true, then the hypothesis (No businesses) is not true. If we accept the premise as true, this implies that the existence of a pub and a restaurant as two functioning businesses is confirmed. In contrast, the hypothesis (No businesses) assumes that there are no businesses, which is in direct contradiction to the premise. Thus, this option is correct. In conclusion, if the premise (Pub, Restaurant) is true, then it is impossible for the hypothesis (No businesses) to be true as they contradict each other. The correct option is therefore (3) no."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

I never turn back, though often so inclined, and in this particular instance, amid such surroundings, everything seemed singularly unfavorable for the calm acceptance of so grim a company. Suppressing my fears, I soon discovered that although as hairy as bears and as crooked as summit pines, the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Thank you for trusting me. I enjoy exchanging my ideas with yours The first thing I want to tell you is that if the boys are calling you names it is their fault, not yours. Boys, at your age, are different from girls. They are trying to prove that they are manly and then often do this by picking on someone who can't really fight back. This is, of course, wrong but it happens. In general, the boys know they are bigger and stronger than you are, so they can make fun of you and make you cry and then laugh about it. If you let them see that they are hurting you, they will only do it more. It isn't that they want to hurt you; they simply want to make themselves feel superior . It's stupid, but it is common. In English we say \\" sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me.\\" Canadian children learn this from their mothers because the same thing that is happening to you in China also happens here. The best ways of getting the boys to stop calling your names is to simply ignore them, knowing that the names can't hurt you and that the boys are being stupid. If you can laugh at them they will get tired of trying to make you cry and they'll give up. It won't be easy, but, trust me, it will work. There is also something else working in your favor and that is that you are growing up and the boys are beginning to notice you as a young woman. I suspect some of them actually like you and are making fun of you just to get your attention. Again, it's stupid but it happens. In reality, you can control this situation by not letting them see you getting hurt. Laugh at them, tell them they're acting like children and they should grow up and then walk away with your head held high. One more thing, Nancy. It is very important that you stop hurting yourself. If someone else hurts you, it is bad enough but you should't make it worse by then hurting yourself.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: FH Joanneum is one of the largest Universities of Applied Sciences in Austria. It has about 4,000 students and about 578 employees. The main campus is located in Graz, while there are two other locations in Kapfenberg and Bad Gleichenberg. All three are situated in the province of Styria, Austria. Hypothesis: A portion of FH Joanneum's student and employee populations attends in Kapfenberg Austria,","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that a portion of FH Joanneum's student and employee populations attends in Kapfenberg, Austria, based on the provided context. The context states that FH Joanneum is one of the largest Universities of Applied Sciences in Austria with approximately 4,000 students and 578 employees. The university has three campuses, with the main one being located in Graz, and the other two in Kapfenberg and Bad Gleichenberg. All these campuses are situated in the province of Styria, Austria. Based on this information, it is reasonable to assume that FH Joanneum's student and employee population is distributed across these three campuses. It is highly likely that the campus in Kapfenberg, being one of the two additional branches of the university, would have a proportion of the student and employee populations attending there. The exact distribution of students and employees among the three campuses is not provided in the context. However, the hypothesis is reasonable considering that universities usually distribute their resources, programs, and personnel across multiple campuses. This allows them to optimize space allocation and cater to local demands for educational resources more efficiently. Moreover, students and employees may choose to attend a specific campus based on several factors such as the availability of programs, proximity to their residence, or personal preference. Thus, it is likely that students and employees living in or around Kapfenberg would opt to attend this campus, contributing to the mentioned portion in the hypothesis. Furthermore, each campus might have its unique features, facilities, or programs that attract students or employees. The Kapfenberg campus could offer specific courses or research opportunities, contributing to a portion of the university's population choosing to attend there. To conclude, the hypothesis that a portion of FH Joanneum's student and employee populations attend in Kapfenberg, Austria, can be reasonably inferred based on the context provided. While the exact distribution of students and employees is not given, it makes logical sense for the university to allocate its resources, including students and employees, across its different campuses for efficient utilization and better access to the local population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot: Buzz and Rick are two private investigators running a well-respected detective agency in a small town. They are childhood friends who have spent years solving cases together and have earned a reputation for their attention to detail and relentless pursuit of the truth. One day, they are approached by Linda, a wealthy widow who suspects her late husband's business partner, Jim, might have been involved in his untimely death. According to Linda, her husband, Paul, and Jim had a tense relationship due to disagreements in their business ventures. She presents an anonymous letter she received alleging Jim's involvement in the crime. Buzz and Rick agree to take on the case and quickly immerse themselves in the world of Paul and Jim's business, a once-thriving real estate development company that has fallen on hard times due to a series of failed projects. Through thorough investigation, they uncover a trail of hidden deals, questionable construction practices, and simmering rivalries. As they dig deeper into the case, Buzz and Rick become increasingly uncomfortable with the nature of the evidence they are uncovering. They begin to find subtle hints that suggest a far more sinister third party behind the murder - someone who has orchestrated the crime from behind the scenes, expertly framing Jim and driving the wedge of suspicion between him and Linda. In a dramatic twist, Buzz and Rick discover the anonymous letters sent to Linda were not only designed to implicate Jim but also to subtly provide the detectives with clues hinting at his guilt. The third party wanted Buzz and Rick to unwittingly help with the murder investigation, ensuring the blame falls on Jim. Determined to expose the true mastermind of this complex murder plot, Buzz and Rick use their expertise in deception and manipulation tactics to lure the real killer into a trap. Along the way, they face life-threatening obstacles, emotional turmoil, and even moments of doubt in their long-standing friendship. The climax of the film sees Buzz and Rick confronting the mastermind of the entire scheme – who turns out to be none other than Linda herself. Motivated by greed, she planned and executed her husband's murder to take over their failing business empire and eliminate Paul's increasing debts. Linda planted false evidence pointing to Jim and chose to involve Buzz and Rick in the case, betting on their skills to eventually convict an innocent man. In a tense final standoff, Buzz and Rick manage to overpower Linda, with the truth finally exposed. The duo resolves their internal conflicts while maintaining their unwavering dedication to justice, vowing to continue their work in rooting out deception and standing by the truth. Double-Edged Deception is a gripping crime thriller that examines the depths of human greed and manipulation, serving as a cautionary tale for those who underestimate the bonds of friendship and the power of the truth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the Browns led 21-0 at halftime, Anthony Fasano and Dexter McCluster factored in each of the scoring drives for Tennessee, as defensive containment limited Mariota for most of the game. The Titans cut the deficit to 21-14 late in the 4th quarter. On their next drive, the Browns reached midfield and faced 3rd and 2. On a broken play, Manziel found Benjamin and threw a touchdown to put the Browns up 28-14. The Titans reached the red zone on their next drive, but Mariota fumbled and lost the ball, allowing the Browns to run out the clock. After committing 5 turnovers in their season opener, the Browns had 0 turnovers while forcing 3 Titans turnovers. For Cleveland, Armonty Bryant led the Browns with 2.5 sacks (of the 7 total) as they pressured the Titans to turn over the ball 3 times, and a selection for AFC Special Teams Player of the Week was bestowed upon WR/KR Travis Benjamin, who had 269 all-purpose yards, including a 78-yard punt return TD.

Article: Coral Polge is a person who has provided comfort to thousands. She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her. Coral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church. She studied art at the local college, where she specialized in textile design. Even though, at the time, she wasn't very good at drawing portraits, she met a medium who told her she would be a psychic artist. She doesn't actually see the dead nor are her hands controlled by the spirits; instead she 'feels' them coming through. Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help. These portraits of guides, who included Red Indians, nuns and monks, were remarkable, yet could have been attributed to the working of a strong imagination. She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died. Coral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it. It's involuntary, like breathing or walking.' Not only are her portraits a good likeness but she sketches her subjects in clothes they would have worn in life. Coral has displayed her talent at public meetings around the world. At one gathering there was a woman whose grandfather had just died. Her name was Phyllis Timms. Coral made a sketch of a man who had a long moustache and Phyllis recognized the man as her grandfather. However, she was reluctant to acknowledge the portrait without extra proof. Coral then said that the colour green was a link with the man whom she had drawn. Mrs Timms, whose maiden name had been Green, understood the significance of the comment and claimed the portrait. There are some people for whom this is evidence of survival from beyond the grave. Others, who have their reservations, may put it down to an extraordinary kind of extrasensory perception . Whatever... Question: According to the passage, Coral can draw the spirits most probably because _ . Answer:","completion":"According to the passage, Coral can draw the spirits most probably because she 'feels' them coming through and knows exactly what to draw without thinking about it, as if it is an involuntary action like breathing or walking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. I am facing a new situation today: It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear. Sarah is going to a family picnic in the park and is trying to decide what dress to wear. She knows it is going to be very hot and sunny today and she has narrowed her choices down to two different dresses. One is a dark colored dress and the other is a white dress. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would the white coat absorb more or less sunlight?","completion":"Based on the background information provided, we can conclude that darker colors absorb more sunlight than lighter colors. This occurs due to the properties of dark and light colors. Dark colors tend to absorb all wavelengths of light and convert them into heat, hence they get warm when exposed to sunlight. On the other hand, lighter colors, such as white, reflect most of the wavelengths of light, preventing them from absorbing much heat. Applying this to your new situation, Johnathan's black coat would absorb more sunlight and hence more heat than the white coat. So, on a cold winter day, the black coat might be a better choice as it would absorb more sunlight and potentially keep him warmer. Similarly, for Sarah, if she wants to stay cooler in the hot and sunny weather, the white dress would be a better choice. The white dress would reflect most of the sunlight, not letting it convert to heat, and thus helping her stay cooler in the sun. So, to answer your specific question: The white coat would absorb less sunlight than a black or darker colored coat, because white, being a lighter color, tends to reflect more sunlight and thus absorbs less of it."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],N={key:0},D={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
