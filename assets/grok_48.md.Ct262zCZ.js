Article: Rick Westhead TSN Senior Correspondent Follow|Archive (Updated: 6:07pm et) - National Hockey League linesman Don Henderson has filed a 10.25 million lawsuit against Calgary Flames defenceman Dennis Wideman more than a year after Wideman hit Henderson from behind during a game against the Nashville Predators. CTV News and TSN have learned that Henderson filed his lawsuit against Wideman on Apr. 18 in a Calgary court. Henderson seeks general damages of 200,000, special damages to pay for housekeeping, yard work and hospital expenses of 50,000, and damages for loss of income and future loss of income of 10 million. The Flames are also listed as a defendant. According to his lawsuit, Henderson suffered injuries to his head, neck back, shoulder, and right knee. He also allegedly suffered a concussion, pain, numbness and tingling in his right arm and hand, shock anxiety and depression, headaches and permanent and partial disability. None of the allegations have been proven in court. No statements of defence have been filed. A Flames spokesperson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment. Wideman hit Henderson during a Jan. 27, 2016, game in Calgary. Wideman was suspended by the league for 20 games as a result of the incident, the second-longest suspension in league history for abusing an official. The NHL said in a video explaining the discipline that Wideman was diagnosed with a concussion after that game, but that his being disoriented was no excuse for “the nature and severity of the offence he committed on the ice.” After an independent arbitrator reduced Wideman’s suspension to 10 games, the NHL went to court in New York in an attempt to vacate the arbitrator’s decision. The league lost that court battle on March 15. In his lawsuit, Henderson’s lawyer wrote that he “has suffered a limitation of activities and loss of enjoyment of life, and will continue to suffer a limitation of activities and enjoyment of life.” Henderson has incurred expenses related to medical care and treatment, prescription medication and other medical supplies, hospital expenses, and other damages, his lawyers claim. “The Plaintiff has been and continues to be unable and restricted in the ability to work as he has yet to get cleared to officiate National Hockey League games, thereby resulting in a loss of income in an amount to be determined at the trial of this action,” the filing says. According to his lawsuit, Henderson suffered injuries to his head, neck back, shoulder, and right knee. He also allegedly suffered a concussion, pain, numbness and tingling in his right arm and hand, shock anxiety and depression, headaches and permanent and partial disability. The government of Alberta is also listed as a plaintiff in the case. “The Plaintiff, the Queen, claims for the cost of health services provided to the Plaintiff, or which will likely be provided to the Plaintiff in the future for the injuries suffered as a result of the wrongful acts or omission of the Defendants as alleged…” According to the statement of claim, the government has asked the court to order Wideman and the Flames to cover the cost of in-patient and out-patient services provided in a hospital, dental surgery services, optometric services, chiropractic services, services provided by a podiatrist, mental health services, drug services, or any goods or services provided by a health service. ||||| Don Henderson, the NHL linesman who was knocked to the ice by Calgary Flames’ defenceman Dennis Wideman during a game against Nashville last year, has filed a 10 million lawsuit against the player and the team. Wideman cross-checked Henderson while returning to the bench after he was hit by the Predators’ Mikka Salomaki during a game on January 27, 2016. The entire incident was caught on camera and about a week later Wideman appologized. \\"First thing I want to apologize to Donnie Henderson. I know I feel awful about what happened and hopefully he's recovering and he's gonna be back on the ice soon but I feel really bad about the whole situation. The last seven days have been tough,\\" he said. Wideman was suspended from play by the league for 20 games even though he claimed that he was disoriented from the hit and that the contact with Henderson was unintentional. The NHLPA appealed the decision on Wideman’s behalf and an independent arbitrator ruled to reduce the suspension down to 10 games. Wideman had already missed 19 games while waiting for a decision on the appeal and returned to the ice before the end of the 2016 season. This week, Henderson filed a 10.25 million statement of claim against Calgary Sports & Entertainment Corp, the Calgary Flames and Wideman. In the claim, Henderson alleges Wideman 'violently' struck him from behind without warning, pushing him to the ice and referred to the hit as an 'attack.' He claims he suffered injuries to his head, neck, shoulder, back, arm, hand and right knee and that he has required psychological counselling in addition to medical treatment. Henderson says he has been unable to work since the incident and has not received clearance from the league to return to the ice. According to the claim, the veteran linesman says he will continue to need 'costly therapy and rehabilitation' and that the incident has cost him millions in lost wages and future earning capacity. None of the allegations have been proven in court and no statements of defence have been filed. The Calgary Flames declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did Henderson’s lawyer. CTV has reached out to Wideman, but has not heard back. |||||Summary:","completion":"NHL linesman Don Henderson has filed a 10.25 million lawsuit against defenceman Dennis Wideman and the Calgary Flames over an incident where Wideman hit him from behind during a game against the Nashville Predators.

The bird would struggle to find suitable nesting locations, materials, or face challenges due to external factors (e.g. weather conditions, predators, or human interference).

She was raised in rural Kentucky and lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. Her widely known works include \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\", the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and \\"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle\\", a non-fiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally. - Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the creative ability to form images, ideas, and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses, such as seeing or hearing. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \\"evoke worlds\\". - A fair (archaic: faire or fayre) is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice. - In linguistics, sound symbolism, phonesthesia or phonosemantics is the idea that vocal sounds or phonemes carry meaning in and of themselves. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. - Phonaesthetics (from the \\"phn\\", \\"voice-sound\\"; and \\"aisthtik\\", \\"aesthetics\\") is the study of the inherent pleasantness (euphony) or unpleasantness (cacophony) of the sound of certain words, phrases, and sentences. - The PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction, formerly known as the Bellwether Prize for Fiction is a biennial award given by the PEN American Center and Barbara Kingsolver to a U.S. citizen for a previously unpublished work of fiction that address issues of social justice. The prize was established by noted author Barbara Kingsolver, and is funded by her. Winning authors receive a 25,000 award and a publishing contract, from which they receive royalties. - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. - Marjorie Kowalski Cole ( July 20 , 1953 -- December 4 , 2009 ) was a writer of poetry , short stories and novels . She won the 2004 Bellwether Prize ( for previously unpublished works of fiction which address issues of social justice ) with her first novel Correcting the Landscape . - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - A novella is a work of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. The English word \\"\\"novella\\" derives from the Italian \\"novella\\", feminine of \\"novello\\", which means \\"new\\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages. - Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities. - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - JUSTICE is a human rights and law reform organisation based in the United Kingdom. It is the British section of the International Commission of Jurists, the international human rights organisation of lawyers devoted to the legal protection of human rights worldwide. Consequently, members of JUSTICE are predominantly barristers and solicitors, judges, legal academics, and law students. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - PEN America Center (PEN), founded in 1922 and based in New York City, works to advance literature, to defend free expression, and to foster international literary fellowship. The Center has a membership of 3,300 writers, editors, and translators. PEN America Center is the largest of the 144 centers that belong to PEN International, the worldwide association of writers that defends those who are harassed, imprisoned and killed for their views. PEN America Center is one of two PEN centers located in the USA, the other is PEN Center USA in Los Angeles, it covers the USA west of the Mississippi. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems. - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. What is the relationship between 'marjorie kowalski cole' and 'novelist'? A:","completion":"Marjorie Kowalski Cole was an American writer known for her works in poetry, short stories, and novels. She is primarily associated with the term \\"novelist\\" because her most notable work, \\"Correcting the Landscape,\\" is a novel. This work earned her the 2004 Bellwether Prize (now known as the PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction) for previously unpublished works of fiction that address issues of social justice.

And are you ready for chocolate chip? Countless bagel bakeries on the Island have bagels in several flavors, but at Bagel Boss in Hicksville, the varieties definitely break new ground. Chocolate chip and spinach bagels, which they bake regularly, might appeal to the curious, ready to sample anything new. The spinach is salt-free, slightly vegetal-tasting and good with cheese. As for the chocolate chip, it ranks fairly low on my list of culinary delights, about on a par with chocolate cream cheese. Cinnamon raisin, on the other hand, while no longer a novelty, is given distinctive character at Bagel Boss with the cinnamon traced in deep swirls and plenty of big juicy raisins throughout. These can become addictive. The cinnamon raisin bagels - like the chocolate chip, spinach, rich egg, savory rye and excellent whole wheat bagels - are huge, almost twice the size of a common bagel. And unlike what Mel Rosner, the owner of Bagel Boss, estimates to be 95 percent of the bagels sold today, they are made by hand, not machine. ''Someone invented a bagel machine about 15 years ago, and that changed the whole business,'' Mr. Rosner said. ''Until then, bagels were always made by hand, but now the handmade is dying out.'' The large bagels made and sold at Bagel Boss are all hand-rolled by Sol Sapadin, a baker, who estimates that he makes 72,000 bagels a week by hand to accommodate retail sales and wholesale accounts. A new vegetable flavor, combining sweet potatoes, carrots, broccoli and spinach in the dough, will be introduced shortly. Smaller bagels, the plain classic plus six other flavors (onion, garlic, salt, sesame, poppyseed and pumpernickel), are stamped out by machine. Bagel Boss, which does a lively wholesale business, also makes minibagels and even miniature bialys, these particularly appealing for elegant brunches. Onion boards, regular bialys, bialy sticks, onion and garlic breads and caraway-flavored braided bagel rolls, ideal for sandwiches, are some other specialties. For parties, Bagel Boss will take orders for giant bagels, two feet in diameter, that can be split and layered with various fillings to feed about a dozen guests. These are priced at 5. Fillings for bagels - whether giant, mini, extra large or normal - include the whitefish salad, baked salmon salad or all-natural vegetable cream cheese spread also made by Bagel Boss. Bags of ''bagel thins,'' crisp, toasted thin bagel slices, are 79 cents each. If you buy two bags, the third one is free. Similarly, purchasing a dozen bagels, either of the hand-rolled varieties at 30 cents each or the regular ones at 20 cents, entitles you to an extra one. Minibagels and minibialys are 1.30 a dozen, and many of the other specialty items are 40 cents each. Mr. Rosner's partners in the business are two of his sons, Randy and Jerry. A third son, Adam, who is 17 years old, is apprenticing. ''We bought what was a very ordinary and not particularly well-run bagel bakery about five years ago,'' said Mr. R osner, who has been inthe business for 35 years. ''Almost from the beginning we started adding flavor s and sizes, but it's been gradual. The salads and cheese are th e newest line.'' Bagel Boss, which also sells hot coffee, daily newspapers, dairy products and some very dreary commercial pastries that really do not deserve to be displayed alongside the bagels, is open every day, 24 hours a day. The address is 432 South Oyster Bay Road, Hicksville. The telephone number is 681-1856 or 935-9879.

Are the following two questions the same? What is the difference between tablets and pills? What is the difference between a Sedative and a Sleeping pill?","completion":"While these two questions appear similar, they are actually inquiring about two distinct topics. The first question is focused on the differences between tablets and pills, which are two different forms of medicines. The second question, on the other hand, is concerned with the differences between a sedative and a sleeping pill, which are two types of medications with specific purposes. 1. What is the difference between tablets and pills? Tablets and pills are both oral dosage forms of medication, but they differ in their physical appearance, production processes, and composition. A. Tablets: Tablets are a solid dosage form that consists of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and other excipients. They are usually compressed and have a uniform shape, typically round or oval. Tablets can be coated or uncoated. A coating can be used for various purposes, such as to improve taste, delay the release of the API, or improve stability. Key features of tablets: - Compressed and usually have a uniform shape and size - May have a score line to be broken into smaller doses if needed - Can be coated or uncoated - May offer a controlled or delayed release mechanism B. Pills: Pills, on the other hand, are older forms of medication that were traditionally made by mixing active pharmaceutical ingredients and other excipients with a binding agent and rolling the mixture into a round shape by hand or using a pill machine. Today, the term \\"pill\\" is often used colloquially to describe any small, round, oral medication like a tablet or capsule. Key features of pills: - Typically refers to small, round oral medications - Can include solid dosage forms such as tablets or capsules - Historically, hand-rolled and may have been less uniform in shape and size - Modern usage of the term \\"pill\\" is often interchangeable with \\"tablet\\" 2. What is the difference between a Sedative and a Sleeping pill? The second question refers to different types of medication with specific purposes: sedatives and sleeping pills. A. Sedatives: Sedatives, also known as anxiolytics or tranquilizers, are a class of medications used to treat anxiety, panic disorders, and some other psychiatric conditions. They function by depressing the central nervous system, thereby promoting relaxation, reducing anxiety, and inducing drowsiness. Examples of sedatives include benzodiazepines (such as diazepam, alprazolam, and lorazepam), barbiturates, and some non-benzodiazepine drugs (like buspirone). Sedatives are typically prescribed for short-term use or as-needed to provide quick relief from acute anxiety symptoms. Key characteristics of sedatives: - Clinical purpose is to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation - Can induce drowsiness as a side effect - Generally prescribed for short-term use or on an as-needed basis - Examples include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and some non-benzodiazepine drugs B. Sleeping Pills: Sleeping pills, also known as hypnotics, are a class of medications prescribed primarily for individuals with insomnia or other sleep disorders. These medications aim to help people fall asleep and stay asleep by targeting specific neurotransmitters and receptors in the brain. Some sleeping pills may also have sedative effects. Examples of hypnotics include benzodiazepines (e.g., temazepam), non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone), and melatonin receptor agonists (e.g., ramelteon). Key characteristics of sleeping pills: - Clinical purpose is to treat insomnia and sleep disorders - Help individuals fall asleep and stay asleep - May have sedative effects - Examples include benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and melatonin receptor agonists In summary, while both questions involve different forms or purposes of medications, they address different aspects of the pharmaceutical world. The first question discusses the distinctions between tablets and pills, which are both oral medication forms. The second question, however, compares sedatives and sleeping pills—two types of medications intended to serve different therapeutic purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Forum has initiated a process of informal collaboration with various organizations and legal experts, aiming to gather insight and input from different perspectives. This inclusive approach is essential to ensure that the resulting code is comprehensive and addresses the complex issues surrounding human trafficking effectively. The workshop, which will bring together experienced journalists, lawyers, NGOs, and victims of human trafficking, is a crucial step in the code's development. By involving those with direct experience in the legal and journalistic fields, as well as those directly affected by human trafficking, the workshop will foster meaningful discussions and debates that can inform the code's content. Moreover, involving NGOs in this process is vital as they often have firsthand knowledge of trends in human trafficking and possess a deep understanding of the mechanisms driving this phenomenon. NGOs work on the frontline, providing services, information, and support to victims, and this practical experience will be invaluable in crafting a code that is both effective and realistic. Victims of human trafficking are perhaps the most important stakeholders in the development of this code, as their experiences and perspectives can provide unique insights into the nature and impact of new legal frameworks and regulations. It is essential to include their voices in these discussions, ensuring that the resulting code fully addresses their needs and concerns and contributes to preventing future trafficking cases. In addition to developing the code itself, this workshop will present an opportunity for participants to exchange knowledge and best practices, identify strategies for countering human trafficking, and create a network of professionals committed to addressing this critical issue. By fostering such collaboration, the Forum aims to facilitate long-lasting change, as well as promote awareness of the scale and consequences of human trafficking. In summary, the Forum is organizing a workshop that involves a diverse group of stakeholders, including experienced journalists, lawyers, NGOs, and victims of human trafficking, to develop an effective code grounded in real-world experiences and expertise. By bringing together these parties in a collaborative setting, the Forum seeks to promote open dialogue and share knowledge, leading to the development of a robust and comprehensive code to address the issue of human trafficking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Birth of the Cool is a compilation album by American jazz musician Miles Davis, released in 1957 on Capitol Records. It compiles eleven tracks recorded by Davis's nonet for the label over the course of three sessions during 1949 and 1950. Featuring unusual instrumentation and several notable musicians, the music consisted of innovative arrangements influenced by classical music techniques such as polyphony, and marked a major development in post-bebop jazz. As the title suggests, these recordings are considered seminal in the history of cool jazz. The nonet recorded twelve tracks for Capitol during three sessions over the course of nearly a year and a half. Davis, Konitz, Mulligan and Barber were the only musicians who played on all three sessions, though the instrumental lineup was constant (excepting the omission of piano on a few songs and the addition of Hagood on \\"Darn That Dream\\"). The first session occurred on January 21, 1949, recording four tracks: Mulligan's \\"Jeru\\" and \\"Godchild\\" as well as Lewis's \\"Move\\" and \\"Budo\\". Jazz critic Richard Cook hypothesizes that Capitol, wanting to get a good start, recorded these numbers first because they were the most catchy tunes in the nonet's small repertoire. That date Kai Winding replaced Zwerin on trombone, Al Haig replaced Lewis on piano, and Joe Shulman replaced McKibbon on bass. The second recording date came three months later on April 22, 1949 with Davis filling in for Fats Navarro in Tadd Dameron's band with Charlie Parker during the interim. The band returned to the studio with five substitutions in personnel: J. J. Johnson on trombone, Sandy Siegelstein on French horn, Nelson Boyd on bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums, and John Lewis returning to piano. At this session, the nonet recorded Mulligan's \\"Venus de Milo\\", Lewis's \\"Rouge\\", Carisi's \\"Israel\\", and \\"Boplicity\\", a collaboration between Davis and Evans, credited to the pseudonym \\"Cleo Henry\\". The band did not return to the studio again until March 9, 1950. Davis did not call the band for any rehearsals or live performances between the second and third recording dates. The March 1950 date featured Mulligan's \\"Darn That Dream\\", \\"Rocker\\", and \\"Deception\\", and Evans's arrangement of Chummy MacGregor's \\"Moon Dreams\\", which had been released in a jazz arrangement by Glenn Miller and the AAF Band in 1944 on V-Disc. The band saw more substitutions, with Gunther Schuller on French horn and Al McKibbon on bass. Kenny Hagood returned for vocals on \\"Darn That Dream\\".

Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Q: Context: Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction., Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction., A novelization (or novelisation) is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline., For Love of Mother - Not ( 1983 ) is a science fiction novel written by Alan Dean Foster . The book is chronologically the first in the Pip and Flinx series , though it was written fourth , as a prequel to help flesh out Flinx 's early history ., Alan Dean Foster (born November 18, 1946) is an American writer of fantasy and science fiction, a prolific creator of and contributor to book series as well as the author of more than 20 standalone novels. He is especially prolific in his novelizations of film scripts., Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\"., Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company)., The Humanx Commonwealth is a fictional interstellar ethical/political entity featured in the science fiction novels of Alan Dean Foster. The Commonwealth takes its name from its two major sapient species, who jointly inhabit Commonwealth planets and administer both the political and religious/ethical aspects. They are the mammalian Humans of the planet Earth and the insectoid Thranx which dwell upon Hivehom. The Commonwealth is described as a progressive, well-intentioned liberal democracy spanning many star systems, and is somewhat similar to the United Federation of Planets from \\"Star Trek\\". The Humanx Commonwealth is notable for its portrayal of a humanalien relationship that is not just mutually beneficial but symbiotic, allowing an amalgamation of the two species., Philip Lynx, known by the nickname of \\"Flinx,\\" is a fictional character, an adventurous young man with unusual qualities in a series of books set in the \\"Humanx Commonwealth\\", written by Alan Dean Foster and published by Del Rey Books., The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature., Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction., Subject: for love of mother-not, Relation: publisher, Options: (A) ballantine (B) creatures (C) del rey books (D) faster than light (E) naturalis (F) portal (G) star trek (H) success A:","completion":"(C) del rey books"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does \\"The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing amino acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally.\\" correctly answer the question of What do fatty acid monomers that are bound to glycerol backbones make up?","completion":"No, the statement given talks about the fundamental components of proteins, which are amino acids, rather than the composition of fatty acid monomers bound to glycerol backbones. Fatty acid monomers that are bound to glycerol backbones make up a type of lipid known as triglycerides, or triacylglycerols. Triglycerides are an essential component of our diet and are the primary form of stored energy in living organisms. They are vastly different from proteins, as proteins are composed of amino acids, while triglycerides consist of a glycerol molecule and three fatty acids. Triglycerides' structure comprises a glycerol backbone, which is an alcohol with three carbons, each having a hydroxyl group (-OH). Each hydroxyl group of glycerol is esterified with a fatty acid. The fatty acids in triglycerides can be of varying lengths and levels of saturation, which affects the triglyceride's properties, such as its melting point and chemical stability. In a triglyceride molecule, the fatty acid component consists of a long hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl group (-COOH) at one end. Fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated, determined by the presence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. Saturated fatty acids have single carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds, while unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more double carbon-carbon (C=C) bonds. When a triglyceride has one or more unsaturated fatty acids, it is called an unsaturated fat, while when it is comprised entirely of saturated fatty acids, it is classified as a saturated fat. Triglycerides serve multiple functions in living organisms, including energy storage, insulation, and protection. They are primarily stored in specialized cells called adipocytes, which compose adipose tissue. When an organism requires energy, triglycerides are broken down into glycerol and free fatty acids, which can be further metabolized to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fulfill energy needs. In summary, fatty acid monomers that are bound to glycerol backbones form a type of lipid called triglycerides (triacylglycerols). This structure is composed of a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid chains, and it plays essential roles in energy storage, insulation, and protection in living organisms. Triglycerides are distinct from proteins, which are made up of nitrogen-containing amino acids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: ATLANTA (AP) — Eleven former Atlanta public school educators were convicted Wednesday of racketeering for their role in a wide-ranging conspiracy to inflate scores on students' standardized tests. Only one teacher was acquitted of all charges. The 11 convicted represented teachers, testing coordinators and other administrators who were accused of participating in the conspiracy dating to 2005, motivated by pressure to meet federal and local standards to receive bonuses or keep their jobs in the Atlanta Public Schools district of about 50,000 students. A state investigation in 2011 found that educators gave answers to students or changed answers on tests after they were turned in. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation. A grand jury indicted 35 educators in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, false statements and theft. Many reached plea agreements, and some testified at the trial. Superintendent Beverly Hall never went to trial, successfully arguing she was too sick to mount a defense. She died last month of breast cancer. Hall insisted she was innocent and had no part in any cheating. But the educators said she was among those pressuring them to inflate students' scores to show gains in achievement — which were needed to meet federal benchmarks tied to extra funding. Defense attorneys argued those convicted should remain free until sentencing because they don't have prior records, have community ties and showed up to trial every day. However, only one was allowed to remain free on bond — teacher Shani Robinson — because she is expecting to give birth soon. \\"They are convicted felons as far as I'm concerned,\\" said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter. \\"They have made their bed and they're going to have to lie in it.\\" Bob Rubin, the defense attorney for former elementary school principal Dana Evans, said he was angry the judge decided to take the convicted former educators into custody immediately. \\"I am shocked that he felt it necessary to do that,\\" Rubin said. \\"I felt it to be unnecessary and vindictive.\\" Prosecutors said the 12 former educators on trial were looking out for themselves, seeking bonuses for higher test scores rather than worrying about the education of the children they were charged with teaching. Defense attorneys said their clients were caught up in an overly broad prosecution that overreached in charging them with violating racketeering laws most often used for organized crime. The entire process was lengthy: The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years. The investigation involved at least 50 schools as well as hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said it was the biggest and most complex case his office had ever handled. \\"Our entire effort in this case was simply to get our community to stop and take a look at the education system,\\" Howard said. The cheating came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that some scores were statistically improbable. Hall served as superintendent for more than a decade, which is rare for an urban schools chief. She was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009 and credited with raising student test scores and graduation rates, particularly among the district's poor and minority students. But the award quickly lost its luster as her district became mired in the scandal. In a video message to schools staff before she retired, Hall warned that the state investigation launched by former Gov. Sonny Perdue would likely reveal \\"alarming\\" behavior. \\"It's become increasingly clear that a segment of our staff chose to violate the trust that was placed in them,\\" Hall said. \\"There is simply no excuse for unethical behavior and no room in this district for unethical conduct. I am confident that aggressive, swift action will be taken against anyone who believed so little in our students and in our system of support that they turned to dishonesty as the only option.\\" ||||| Guilty verdicts were reached for 11 of the 12 defendants in the Atlanta Public Schools CRCT cheating trial. Dessa Curb was the only defendant found not guilty on all charges. Listed below are the 12 educators that went to trial and what charges they were found guilty, or not guilty of: Racketeering - Guilty Influencing witnesses - Guilty Racketeering - Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements (2 counts) - Not Guilty False swearing - Not Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings (3 counts) Not Guilty , Guilty, Guilty False swearing - Guilty Racketeering - Guilty Theft by taking - Not Guilty False statements & writing (2 counts) Guilty, Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements and writings - Not Guilty Theft by taking - Not Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings (4 counts) - Not Guilty, Not Guilty, Not Guilty , Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty False swearing (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty Racketeering - Not Guilty False statements & writings (2 counts) - Not Guilty, Not Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings - Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements and writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty All of these educators have been accused of racketeering, in addition to charges ranging from theft by taking to making false statements. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed issued the following statement after the verdict Wednesday afternoon: “The APS cheating scandal marked one of the darkest periods in the life of our city. I am hopeful that with the jury's verdict today, we can finally close this chapter and move forward with the education and development of our young people. I want to thank Judge Baxter and the Court for their service.” Unlike 21 others, the 12 educators on trial Wednesday did not take plea deals. Now their fates are sealed. \\"They have made their bed, and they're going to have to lie in it,\\" Judge Jerry Baxter said as he sent most of the educators directly to jail. Ten of the 11 educators found guilty were booked into the Fulton County jail. The men were taken to the jail in northwest Atlanta, while the women were taken to the South Jail Annex for women in Union City. Robinson was the only educator found guilty who was not immediately taken to jail due to her pregnancy. According to a spokesperson with Fulton County police, the 10 educators who were taken to jail Wednesday were all processed as any other inmate would be, including being searched, fingerprinted, given a medical screening, having their booking photograph taken and given inmate uniforms. A total of 35 educators were indicted in March of 2013. Prosecutors said they conspired to cheat or concealed cheating to boost test scores for financial gain. The case, which grabbed national headlines, stemmed from a 2009 investigation that revealed system wide cheating on the Criterion Referenced Competency Test. The test, which was issued to students in the APS system, measured student aptitude statewide. District Attorney Paul L. Howard, Jr. called the verdicts a victory for children. “When we indicted this case our goal was not to make a spectacle of the Atlanta Public School system. It was our attempt to encourage the people in our community to stop and take an honest look at what was happening in our schools and how changing test scores was ultimately harming our children,” says Howard. “We stand here today proud of our efforts, proud that we embarked upon a journey of truth, regardless of how long or arduous the task. We are certain today that our work has not been in vain.” Fulton County prosecutors said the cheating began under the leadership of former superintendent Doctor Beverly Hall.Hall became superintendent in 1999 and submitted her resignation letter in 2010 after cheating allegations surfaced. She officially stepped down in June of 2011. Hall had Stage 4 cancer and never made it to trial. She died on March 2. Atlanta Board of Education Statement This has been a sad and tragic chapter for Atlanta Public Schools that has now come to a close. It has been a painful time for our students, families, employees and the City. However, since Day One 2015, APS has remained focused on the students under the new student-centered Superintendent, Dr. Meria J. Carstarphen, and the new leadership in the Atlanta Board of Education. Reforms began almost three years ago and additional ones have been created under this new leadership to make sure something like this never happens again. Challenges remain, for sure, but we are making progress every day and there is great reason to be optimistic. Dr. Carstarphen and the school board continue to work together to create a new culture at APS, that is a caring one of trust and collaboration where every student graduates ready for college and career. Last fall, the district established a new vision of a high-performing school district where students love to learn, educators inspire, families engage and the community trusts the system. The district remains dedicated to always putting the needs of our students first. Copyright 2015 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

The third theory you might be looking for could be the \\"Interactionist Theory\\" of language acquisition. There are several prominent theories of language acquisition, and here's a summary of the three major ones: 1. Behaviorist Theory: Proposed by B.F. Skinner, this theory posits that language acquisition is a result of imitation, reinforcement, and conditioning. According to this theory, children learn language as they are exposed to it, and they imitate the behaviors and expressions of others, reinforced by the responses they receive from their environment. 2. Nativist Theory: Put forward by Noam Chomsky, this theory argues that children are born with an innate capacity for language, called the Language Acquisition Device (LAD). This theory asserts that there is a universal grammar that all human languages share and that children have the innate ability to acquire language based on this universal grammar. 3. Interactionist Theory: This approach, commonly associated with Lev Vygotsky, suggests that language acquisition is a combination of both nature (innate abilities) and nurture (environmental influences). According to this theory, social interactions with adults and peers play a crucial role in language development. Children learn language through communication and by actively participating in interactions with their environment. These theories provide different perspectives on language acquisition, and no single theory can fully explain the complex process through which humans acquire language. Recent research in linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience indicates that a combination of genetic, developmental, social, and cognitive factors influence language learning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Iraq produces its electricity by burning fossil fuels, while Iran uses nuclear fission as its energy source. Which country causes more environmental problems? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.

The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land (January 8, 1879 November 27, 1971) was an officer in the United States Navy, noted for his contributions to naval architecture, particularly in submarine design. Notable assignments included serving as Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair during the 1930s, and as Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission during World War II. - USNS Short Splice ( T - AK - 249 ) was a United States Maritime Administration C1 - M - AV1 type coastal cargo ship , originally planned as an Alamosa - class cargo ship . Constructed as Short Splice for the Administration , completed in August 1945 and placed in operation by the War Shipping Administration during the closing period of World War II. However , the war ended , and she was transferred to the U.S. Army as USAT Short Splice who kept her in service until transferred to the U.S. Navy in 1950 . - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What was used to make conclusions about internet growth?\\" Context: \\"An analysis of the evolution of mass media in the US and Europe since World War II noted mixed results from the growth of the Internet: \\"The digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression [and] information [but] has had mixed effects on freedom of the press\\": It has disrupted traditional sources of funding, and new forms of Internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what's been lost.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The conclusions about internet growth, as referenced in the context, were made by analyzing the evolution of mass media in the US and Europe since World War II. In this analysis, various factors and evidences were considered: 1. Freedom of Expression and Information: The first criteria for making conclusions was the impact of the internet on freedom of expression and information. The analysis pointed out that the digital revolution, which features the rapid growth of the internet, has been beneficial for freedom of expression and information. This indicates that internet growth has made it easier for people to express their opinions publicly and access information more readily. This could be due to the democratizing nature of the internet which allows users from all walks of life to freely express their opinions. 2. Impact on Traditional Media: The analysis also looked at the effects of internet growth on traditional forms of media like prints, radio and television. This underlined that traditional sources of funding have been disrupted by the internet. As the internet continues to grow and provide alternative means of content distribution, traditional media outlets, which relied heavily on advertising revenue, have been massively affected. This is because advertisers now have more platforms to choose from and online platforms typically offer more cost-effective and targeted advertising opportunities. 3. Emergence of Internet Journalism: The growth of the internet has given rise to new media outlets – indeed, internet journalism has replaced a fraction of what's been lost from traditional media. The comparison of the new and old medium was a significant factor while making conclusions. Despite the proliferation of internet journalism, according to the text, it has been able to replace only a tiny fraction of what's been lost due to the decline in traditional media. This implies that while internet growth has led to more sources of news, these new sources have not been able to fully fill the gap left by declining traditional media. In conclusion, the analysis derived conclusions about internet growth by extensively examining its effects on freedom of expression and information, its impact on traditional media, and the emergence and effectiveness of the new internet journalism. Each of these factors offered insights into how the growth of the internet has transformed mass communication. Furthermore, it emphasized the mixed results of this growth, portraying both the beneficial and detrimental outcomes, making a complex and multi-faceted conclusion on Internet growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Drawing upon her own life story, a story of discrimination shared by too many women across America, Lilly Ledbetter delivered a rousing speech as only she can. Ledbetter, the face of the fight for women's equality, reminded us all just how far we have come in the last four years. She framed fair pay as both an economic and moral issue. She reminded us all of President Barack Obama's first act in office, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which he signed thinking of his mother, wife and two young daughters. Ledbetter, a former manager at a tire plant, knows that her family was deprived of thousands of dollars because of discrimination, money that could have been put back into the U.S. economy. As my mother's son and the brother to two older and wiser sisters, this issue resonates particularly deeply with me. Equal pay for equal work should not be a controversial issue in the 21st Century, but like the debate over contraception and choice, somehow the Republican Party has reignited a debate that should have ended decades ago. Just to be clear, my sisters would scoff if my work was ever called equal to theirs.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please briefly summarize this news article: Dance of seduction is serious business in ‘Forever Tango’ The curtain call is usually the moment when performers can finally relax after a hard night’s work, loosening up and dropping the mask to reveal a bit of their true selves as they bask in the audience’s applause. But when the cast of “Forever Tango’’ took their bows on opening night at the Cutler Majestic Theatre, they remained as formal as they had been all evening, with few if any traces of smiles evident on their faces. That intensity was in keeping with the show they’d just performed, and with the tradition of the Argentine tango. Though it celebrates the power of fiery, heedless passion, “Forever Tango’’ is suffused throughout with an aura of focused professionalism and absolute concentration. That adds up to a display of proficiency without much personality in the show’s first half, when the performers make scant effort to draw in the audience. But after intermission “Forever Tango’’ turns into something special: its routines more challenging; the dancers’ movements still precisely controlled but also more fluid, dynamic, and communicative; their intertwined limbs virtually melding two bodies into one as they sweep across the stage. Conceived by Luis Bravo long before “Dancing With the Stars’’ was so much as a gleam in a network programmer’s eye, “Forever Tango’’ has proven durably popular, ending its most recent Broadway run in September. Bravo is at the helm for the touring production that will be in Boston through Saturday, and he’s also in the orchestra, playing the cello. Cutler Majestic Theatre, 617-824-8000. http://www.cutlermajestic.org Six male-female duos perform more than a dozen tango routines in “Forever Tango,’’ attired in a shimmering array of elegant dresses and suits created by costume designer Argemira Affonso. The dances are punctuated by evocative instrumental numbers performed by the fine orchestra, assembled onstage. Pianist Jorge Vernieri proved to be a particular crowd favorite on opening night. Less effective was vocalist Noemi Marcela, whose singing was often nearly drowned out by the orchestra. The dancers choreographed the tango routines themselves, and they perform them with disciplined technique and plenty of dazzling footwork. Their physical vocabulary relies on rapidly crossed ankles and scissoring legs and languidly stretched-out arms; on spins, twirls, and sudden kicks; on stomping and striding, slow-motion swoons and swift-paced back-and-forths. In one visually striking scene, when Aldana Silveyra and Diego Ortega were entwined, Silveyra allowed her long hair to cling to his head. While Bravo likes to describe the tango as “a story you tell in three minutes,’’ the truth is that “Forever Tango’’ would benefit from more variety in the stories it tells. There is a fundamental sameness to the emotional arc of a number of the tangos, which are enacted with fixed, urgent expressions that suggest everything is riding on this dance, or at least one particular thing, impossible to mistake. (After one smoldering duet, my companion remarked, “They need to get a room.’’) In Act 1, “El Suburbio’’ attempts a larger narrative than straightforward romance and seduction, presenting a scene in a brothel that features suggestively clad women and pinstriped, fedora-wearing tough guys. But a potentially intriguing power struggle dissolves into a farrago of clichés that ultimately generates less tension than the fight scenes Jerome Robbins choreographed for “West Side Story.’’ Act 2 gets off to a strong start with “Tanguera,’’ a duet performed by Soledad Buss and César Peral, and electricity steadily courses through “Forever Tango’’ from that point on. Ariel Manzanares and Natalia Turelli bring some welcome comic relief throughout the show. In one sequence, Manzanares keeps attempting to take pictures of the orchestra with a clunky, old-fashioned camera; later, he parodies the melodramatic seething of the tango dancers. Turelli clings to his back, allowing herself to be dragged as he walks across the stage, and when she tries to steal just a bit of the spotlight by making grand gestures, he quickly returns her hand to his shoulder. In “Quejas de Bandoneón,” Sebastián Ripoll and Mariana Bojanich succeed in creating a pair of distinct personalities while also generating an air of mystery tantalizing enough that you’re left wondering what kind of future awaits these lovers once the dance is over. At the end of “Forever Tango,’’ after the cast took their bows, they delivered one final display of their impressive dance skills. They still weren’t smiling, but by that time the audience was.","completion":"\\"Forever Tango\\" is a theatrical dance performance that beautifully portrays the intensity and passion of the Argentine tango. During the opening night at the Cutler Majestic Theatre, the cast maintained their formal demeanor throughout the show, showcasing a high level of professionalism and concentration.

The dancers choreographed the tango routines themselves, employing a perfect mixture of dazzling footwork, fluid movements, and mesmerizing physicality. While the show starts off with a display of proficiency without much personality, it evolves after intermission, presenting more challenging routines and powerful emotional arcs in the tango acts. Act 2 captivates the audience from the beginning, with the duets delivering memorable performances that bring out both comic relief and intense passion. The show gains momentum and offers moments of intimate connection and electrifying chemistry, leaving the audience enthralled. Luis Bravo, who conceived \\"Forever Tango,\\" is also the show's director and plays the cello in the orchestra. Although the show could benefit from a wider variety of narratives in the performances, the essence of the tango as a story told in three minutes is brilliantly captured on stage. By the end, the cast delivers an impressive display of their dancing skills, leaving the audience captivated and in awe of their dedication to the art of Argentine tango."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.

Only a few micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be androgen regulated. We aim to identify androgen regulated miRNAs. METHODS We utilized LNCaP derived model, we have established, and which overexpresses the androgen receptor (AR), the VCaP cell line, and 13 intact-castrated prostate cancer (PC) xenograft pairs, as well as clinical specimens of untreated (PC) and CRPC. The expression of miRNAs was analyzed by microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR). Transfection of pre-miR-141 and anti-miR-141 was also used. RESULTS Seventeen miRNAs were > 1.5-fold up- or downregulated upon dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment in the cell lines, and 42 after castration in the AR-positive xenografts. Only four miRNAs (miR-10a, miR-141, miR-150*, and miR-1225-5p) showed similar androgen regulation in both cell lines and xenografts. Of those, miR-141 was found to be expressed more in PC and CRPC compared to benign prostate hyperplasia. Additionally, the overexpression of miR-141 enhanced growth of parental LNCaP cells while inhibition of miR-141 by anti-miR-141 suppressed the growth of the LNCaP subline overexpressing AR. CONCLUSIONS Only a few miRNAs were found to be androgen-regulated in both cell lines and xenografts models. Of those, the expression of miR-141 was upregulated in cancer. The ectopic overexpression of miR-141 increased growth of LNCaP cell suggesting it may contribute to the progression of PC.

A family told of their horror yesterday after a fox crept into their home through a catflap and attacked their young son. The two-year-old boy screamed in pain as the animal bit his heel, drawing blood. His startled parents ran upstairs after being alerted by the cries and found the fox sitting at the end of the child's bed. The animal then darted into another room and hid under a bed before running out of the house in New Addington, south London. The parents, who did not wish to be named, took the toddler to Croydon University Hospital, where he was put on a course of antibiotics. Yesterday the child's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, 46, said the boy has been left with two bite marks on his heel. She said: 'When I heard, my whole body went like jelly. I could not move. You think if they did not hear the fox, then it could have run off with him.' Mrs Vaizey, a care worker who has four children and nine grandchildren, said she had heard about fox attacks, but never dreamed it would happen to her family. 'When it is this close to home, it is so frightening,' she added; 'But he is fine. He is a tough little boy.' She added: 'He is the sort of boy that falls over all the time and has a laugh about it afterwards. 'But I just think it is so lucky they were still up at the time. ' She said the family had now put a panel over the catflap to prevent the fox coming back after the incident at 2am on October 30. She added: 'My daughter wanted to kill the fox. She said she never had a problem with them before, but now she hates them. 'She said this one looked really healthy and that he looked well-fed, so you do worry.' In June 2010, nine-month-old twins Lola and Isabella Koupparis were mauled by a fox that entered their home in Hackney, east London. Lola received facial and arm injuries, while her sister received arm injuries. The boy's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, said she had heard about fox attacks but never dreamed it would happen to a member of her family. In February last year, a fox got into the bedroom of a one-month-old baby in Bromley and bit the child's finger off. Urban wildlife expert John Bryant said yesterday: 'Attacks like this are extremely rare and it involved the heel. 'There have been cases where people have been lying on sunbeds in their garden and have woken up to find a fox nibbling their toes. 'The fox is obviously investigating. It is very common for foxes to come in through catflaps. 'It is always wise to keep the cat in and shut the catflap at night. It is another incident, but fortunately minor.' The attack - which left the boy needing hospital treatment - happened in New Addington, south London last month. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A two-year-old boy in South London was attacked by an urban fox that had entered the family home through a catflap. The young child sustained bite injuries on his heel, resulting in a hospital visit and a course of antibiotics. The shaken parents found the fox sitting at the foot of the child's bed before it hid in another room and eventually fled the house. This shocking incident has left the child's family putting a panel over the catflap and harboring negative feelings towards foxes. The boy's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, expressed her relief that her grandson is a tough child and that her daughter and son-in-law were awake when the attack happened. Fox attacks are relatively rare; however, they may increase in frequency as urban fox populations interact more with humans. It is vital for families with young children to take the necessary precautions, such as keeping catflaps closed at night, to avoid unwanted fox encounters. Urban wildlife expert John Bryant emphasizes the rarity of fox attacks and advises that people should maintain a sense of proportion and not let fear govern their behavior towards these wild animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rio Ferdinand has revealed how Roy Keane gave him an 'absolute rollocking' on his first day of Manchester United training because he wasn't being 'positive' enough in his play. The former England centre back moved to Old Trafford in 2002 and played with Keane for three seasons. And Ferdinand has explained how the ex-Ireland midfielder showed him in no uncertain terms what it meant to be a United player.

From the moment Rio Ferdinand stepped onto the training pitch at Old Trafford, he was introduced to the standards and mentality that had become synonymous with Sir Alex Ferguson's era at Manchester United. The Red Devils were a team that demanded success, and this ethos was encapsulated by their midfield general, Roy Keane. The Irishman's drive and competitive nature were a vital component in the club's dominance both domestically and in Europe. Ferdinand, who was signed for a record-breaking fee at the time, quickly learned that there was no time for settling in or taking it easy. Despite his impressive performances for Leeds United and the England national team, Ferdinand was not granted any special treatment when he joined the Manchester giants. Roy Keane, as the team's captain, took it upon himself to ensure that the new signing understood the level of commitment required to succeed at the club. This instance highlighted Keane's role as an enforcer within the squad, making sure that every player gave their all in training and brought out the best of themselves. It was this relentless desire for victory that made Keane a vital cog in the Manchester United machine, driving his teammates to push their limits and fulfill their potential. Ferdinand, though initially startled by the intensity of his new teammate, would go on to embrace this winning mentality and form a formidable partnership with fellow defender Nemanja Vidic. Together, they would help form the backbone of a defense that would secure multiple Premier League titles, domestic cups, and the UEFA Champions League. In the end, it was not just Keane's talent on the pitch that made him an invaluable asset to Manchester United; it was his unwavering determination and ability to inspire those around him, even if it required a tough-love approach. Roy Keane's contribution to the club's list of honours is a testament to both his individual ability as a footballer and his effectiveness as a leader. Looking back on this first encounter with Keane, Rio Ferdinand can now appreciate the tough initiation he received, understanding the importance of the winning mentality that was instilled in him from day one at the club, a mentality that would carry him through years of successful partnerships, assertive team dynamics, and personal growth both on and off the football pitch."},{"prompt":"Information: - The leader or chairman of a parliamentary group holds an influential political post in a parliamentary system with strong party discipline. When a party is in opposition, or the minor or junior partner in a governing coalition, they are not often the political leader of the party and the primary spokesperson for the party, although this is also true of the governing party in some cases.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly Answer:","completion":"The final step of the described process is the eruption of a volcano. To provide a detailed explanation, let's go through each stage of the process: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the earth: Various gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, are produced and trapped inside the Earth's mantle. As these gases accumulate, they create internal pressure. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: The increased pressure forces molten magma (a mixture of molten rock, minerals, and gases) to rise closer to the Earth's surface. This often occurs through magma chambers and cracks in the earth's crust known as fissures. 3. The magma cools: Once the magma reaches the surface, it is exposed to lower temperatures and starts to cool. It can cool down either slowly or rapidly, depending on the environment and specific conditions. As the magma cools, it becomes solid, forming volcanic rocks (such as basalt or andesite) or ash deposits. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly: Over time, as gases continue to accumulate, and more magma is pushed toward the surface, the pressure within the magma chamber, fissures, or beneath the Earth's crust continues to build up. Final Step: Volcanic eruption: When the pressure becomes too great, a volcanic eruption occurs. The eruption can be explosive or effusive, depending on the amount of gas content and magma viscosity. Explosive eruptions involve powerful explosions that release ash, lava, and gases into the atmosphere. Effusive eruptions, on the other hand, involve the slow outpouring of lava on the Earth's surface without any significant explosion. After the eruption, the volcanic materials (lava, ash, rocks) continue to cool down and solidify, creating landforms like volcanic cones, lava domes, or extensive lava fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague. An effective, and classy, little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat. Set and filmed in and around New Orleans, Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine, Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story. It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director. In turn, Richard Widmark {bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire}, Paul Douglas, Jack Palance (as Walter Jack Palance) & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel, all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic. Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece. From Widmark's Public Health doctor, with hypodermic needle in hand, running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point. To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema. With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior. It's an imaginative and intelligently written story, one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease. A blight on society as it were. It's noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being. While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created. Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway, this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end. Not essential film-noir, and maybe not even essential Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day. 7.5/10 Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thought positively of the movie.

Q:Given the following context: Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991, the same day as Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind. It was certified gold just over two months later on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, \\"Give it Away\\" did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to \\"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\\". KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, \\"was the beginning of the infusion of 'Give It Away' into mass consciousness.\\" The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blood Sugar Sex Magik has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.Due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\", the band did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing \\"Under the Bridge\\", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially \\"mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people ... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'\\" \\"Under the Bridge\\" was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magik's second single. By January 1992, \\"Under the Bridge\\" had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.To promote the album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed they would make the trip. However, it proved difficult for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days.

He does this because _____ is smoother for his jumps. (A) tall grass (B) black ice Answer:","completion":"The answer your students should choose for this logic test is: (B) black ice. To break it down, let's analyze the context of the question. The logic test presents a scenario in which a grasshopper hops through tall grass but encounters difficulties, which can be inferred by the phrase \\"gets hung up.\\" As a result, the grasshopper decides to change its course and hops onto black ice to improve its movement. The test then asks for the reasoning behind the grasshopper's preference for one surface over the other. The phrase \\"to glide faster\\" suggests that the grasshopper hops on black ice because it allows for easier and smoother movement compared to the tall grass. Therefore, the most logical explanation for the grasshopper's decision is that black ice offers a more conducive environment for the insect to achieve its desired level of mobility. In conclusion, based on the given information in the logic test and evaluating the context of the scenario, it is clear that black ice provides a smoother surface for the grasshopper's jumps as opposed to tall grass.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What happens next in this paragraph? A couple of men are working inside a house. They scrape a ceiling clean, then apply spackling. they Pick from: I. use a back scratcher to wipe it clean with a towel.; II. replace the tiles with a new one.; III. place wetness and plaster onto the ceiling over the plaster.; IV. cover the entire ceiling with the spackling.;","completion":"After scraping the ceiling clean and applying the spackling, the men choose option IV, which is to cover the entire ceiling with spackling. They do this carefully and methodically, ensuring that the spackling is spread evenly across the surface. This is important because the goal of this process is to achieve a smooth and level ceiling, free of any cracks, dents, or other imperfections. The men start by using a broad putty knife to apply the spackling compound to the ceiling. They hold the putty knife at a slight angle and push the spackling across the ceiling, applying an even layer of the material. They add more spackling to the putty knife as needed, ensuring that they always have enough to properly cover the ceiling. As they work, the men pay close attention to any areas that may need extra attention, such as dents or holes from previously removed fixtures or other damage. They carefully cover these areas with additional spackling, feathering the edges to blend it seamlessly with the surrounding surface. Frequently, they assess their progress, taking a step back to view the whole ceiling and ensure that the surface remains even and smooth. In some areas, they may need to go over the spackling with a finer putty knife or a wet sponge to eliminate any trowel marks or ridges, blending the material flawlessly into the ceiling. They repeat this process over the entire ceiling, ensuring that every square inch of the surface receives the same meticulous treatment. Once the men have covered the entire ceiling with spackling, they take a moment to double-check their work, making sure there are no missed spots or irregularities. When they are satisfied with the coverage and smoothness of the applied spackling, they leave it to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. The drying process often takes a few hours or even overnight, depending on the type of spackling used and the ambient conditions in the room. After the spackling has sufficiently dried and hardened, the men return to the room to inspect the surface. They may need to sand the dried spackling slightly, using fine-grit sandpaper to ensure a perfectly smooth finish that is ready for the final touch - painting or applying another surface treatment like wallpaper or textured finish. In conclusion, when faced with the task of scraping a ceiling clean and applying spackling, the best course of action for the men working inside the house is to cover the entire ceiling with the spackling. This involves applying the material evenly, addressing any imperfections, smoothing out trowel marks or ridges, and allowing ample time for drying. Once the spackling is dry, the men may need to sand the surface to ensure an impeccable finish that is ready for painting or other decorative treatments."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on margaret bechstein hays 's: - death date - birth date - name - death place - birth place Bio: margaret bechstein hays -lrb- december 6 , 1887 -- august 21 , 1956 -rrb- was a passenger on the rms \`\` titanic '' . she and her dog survived the ship 's sinking , escaping on lifeboat no. 7 . following the disaster , she cared for two small children known as the \`\` titanic orphans '' in her new york city home until their mother claimed them .

I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat.

My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online.

The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house.

Eric covered his nose with a tissue in a feeble attempt to filter the air around him. He had been friends with Brett for years and yet, he still found it difficult to adapt to Brett's obsession for fresh flowers; an obsession that made every visit to Brett's house an absolute nightmare for Eric, who was unfortunately allergic to pollen. It all started when the two of them were roommates in college. Brett would always sneak fresh flowers into their room, carefully placing them around the space to brighten up the atmosphere. Eric, on the other hand, would constantly sneeze and wake up with puffy eyes. Eventually, they found a compromise. Brett agreed to limit the number of fresh flowers in their shared space, while Eric tried to build up a tolerance by taking allergy medication. As the years passed, they both moved on to their respective lives, but remained close friends. In spite of the challenges that the flowers posed to Eric, he appreciated the beauty they brought to Brett's home. He couldn't ignore the vibrant colors and the delightful scent that always filled the rooms. Thus, every time he visited Brett, he would endure the sniffles and watery eyes, unwilling to miss out on the joy that the flowers brought.

Meanwhile, a subsidence problem that had irreparably damaged at least 10 downtown buildings by 1928 worsened through the 1930s. Dozens of buildings, including the post office and jail, were lost as the earth beneath them sank away. Contributing causes were geologic faulting in the area, blast vibrations from the mines, and erosion that may have been exacerbated by vegetation-killing smelter smoke.Mining continued at a reduced level in the Verde District until 1953, when Phelps Dodge shut down the United Verde Mine and related operations. Jerome's population subsequently fell below 100. To prevent the town from disappearing completely, its remaining residents turned to tourism and retail sales. They organized the Jerome Historical Society in 1953 and opened a museum and gift shop.To encourage tourism, the town's leaders sought National Historic Landmark status for Jerome; it was granted by the federal government in 1967. In 1962, the heirs of James Douglas donated the Douglas mansion, above the UVX mine site, to the State of Arizona, which used it to create Jerome State Historic Park. By sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the 21st century include art galleries, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the reason Brown was suspected of committing the murders?, using the article: The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi...., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"The reason James Brown and his overseer, Eastwood, were suspected of committing the Avenue Range Station massacre was due to their suspected motive of retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep by the Aboriginal Australians. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines, who then conducted an investigation in the district. Based on the evidence and testimonies gathered during his enquiries, Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Although proceedings started in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, they were eventually abandoned. This was primarily due to key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fleeing the colony or refusing to cooperate with the investigation. Moreover, there were significant legal restrictions on the use of evidence provided by Aboriginal witnesses, particularly in cases where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal obstacles, combined with settler solidarity, ensured that the case did not go to trial.

However, since the available choices provided are only (a) negative or (b) positive, it's essential to analyze the content of the review further and determine which sentiment is more prominent. The positive aspects mentioned in the review include: 1. Fast taxi service - This indicates satisfaction with the transportation services provided. 2. A people-watching mecca - This implies that the environment is lively, social, and engaging, which some people consider to be a desirable aspect. 3. Decent amount of food and drink choices - A good variety in dining options generally contributes to a positive experience. 4. Slot machines - The presence of entertainment options such as slot machines can enhance an individual's overall enjoyment. The negative aspects mentioned in the review include: 1. Flight delays - This indicates dissatisfaction with the timeliness and efficiency of the services provided. 2. Slow baggage claim - This implies frustration with the waiting times and inefficiency associated with baggage claim operations. 3. Super packed - This entails a crowded environment, which can be uncomfortable and detract from the overall experience. Comparing the positive and negative aspects in the review, it seems that the significance of the negative experiences (flight delays, slow baggage claim, and crowdedness) might outweigh the positive aspects (fast taxi services, people-watching, food/drink choices, and slot machines). This is mainly because the core services of an airport (flight punctuality and the processing of baggage) seem to be inefficient, which could lead to significant inconvenience and dissatisfaction. Taking these factors into consideration, it may be more accurate to classify the sentiment of this review as (a) negative. Although there are definite positive aspects mentioned, the negative components appear to have a more significant impact on the overall experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context: Throughout most of its history, Istanbul has ranked among the largest cities in the world. By 500 CE, Constantinople had somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 people, edging out its predecessor, Rome, for world's largest city. Constantinople jostled with other major historical cities, such as Baghdad, Chang'an, Kaifeng and Merv for the position of world's most populous city until the 12th century. It never returned to being the world's largest, but remained Europe's largest city from 1500 to 1750, when it was surpassed by London.The Turkish Statistical Institute estimates that the population of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality was 14,377,019 at the end of 2014, hosting 19 percent of the country's population. Then about 97–98% of the inhabitants of the metropolitan municipality were within city limits, up from 89% in 2007 and 61% in 1980. 64.9% of the residents live on the European side and 35.1% on the Asian side. While the city ranks as the world's 5th-largest city proper, it drops to the 24th place as an urban area and to the 18th place as a metro area because the city limits are roughly equivalent to the agglomeration. Today, it forms one of the largest urban agglomerations in Europe, alongside Moscow. The city's annual population growth of 3.45 percent ranks as the highest among the seventy-eight largest metropolises in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The high population growth mirrors an urbanization trend across the country, as the second and third fastest-growing OECD metropolises are the Turkish cities of İzmir and Ankara. Istanbul experienced especially rapid growth during the second half of the 20th century, with its population increasing tenfold between 1950 and 2000. This growth in population comes, in part, from an expansion of city limits—particularly between 1980 and 1985, when the number of Istanbulites nearly doubled. The remarkable growth was, and still is, largely fueled by migrants from eastern Turkey seeking employment and improved living conditions. The... Guess a valid title for it!

The metamorphosis of a Communist Party expatriate to business consultant mirrors China's shift from a closed-door state to a freewheeling money-making society. OPT: [i] World; [ii] Sports; [iii] Business; [iv] Science/Tech;","completion":"This topic is primarily about [iii] Business. The metamorphosis of a Communist Party expatriate to a business consultant showcases China's significant economic transformation over the past few decades. This change has been driven by numerous factors, including China's shift from a centrally planned, closed-door state to a more market-oriented economy with a strong focus on global trade and economic growth. The transition has been both rapid and dramatic, impacting not only those directly involved in the business world but society as a whole. The opening up of China's economic system began earnestly in the late 1970s under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping. His policies emphasized the need to modernize industry, agriculture, technology, and defense while also focusing on expanding foreign trade and investment. One of his most important initiatives was the introduction of the \\"reform and opening-up\\" policy, which encouraged the growth of private enterprise and allowed for the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). These SEZs, such as Shenzhen and Shanghai's Pudong area, provided tax incentives and lighter regulations for foreign companies investing in the region. The resulting influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) drove economic development, spurring growth in Chinese manufacturing capabilities, technological prowess, and infrastructure. Moreover, China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 was another essential milestone in its opening up to the international business community. This event marked China's commitment to adopting international trade rules and regulations, furthering the integration of its economy with the global market. As a result of these reforms, China quickly experienced dramatic growth in its GDP and became the world's second-largest economy after the United States. Its burgeoning middle class and newfound economic prowess opened the Chinese market to a wide array of consumer products and services from all over the world. This has had a profound impact on Chinese society as a whole. The story of a Communist Party expatriate becoming a business consultant is reflective of these profound changes. Once committed to the principles of communism and the strict limitations of a closed economy, this individual's transformation to a business consultant indicates the adaptation necessary to thrive in China's new economic environment. This adaptation showcases the willingness to embrace market-oriented principles and a commitment to economic growth as a means of promoting the well-being of Chinese society. In conclusion, this story is about business, specifically the extraordinary metamorphosis of China's economic policies and the individuals whose lives were affected by these changes. China's shift from a closed-door state to a freewheeling money-making society is a testament to its ability to adapt to an evolving global landscape and a reminder of the power of economic growth to reshape societies and individual lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is supported by examples of cyber attacks being used as acts of aggression, such as the Stuxnet virus and the hacking of Serbia's air defense systems. As the digital domain becomes increasingly important in modern society, with crucial services moving online and military modernization taking place, there is a need for the definition of an act of war to be updated to include cyber attacks as a new form of warfare for the 21st century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who agrees to notify people of the death of their loved ones? Julia Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the protagonist and setting Our protagonist, Julia, is a compassionate and resilient woman in her 30s, living in a small town. She works at the local hospital, specifically for the palliative care unit. The hospital is struggling with a high volume of patients due to an ongoing pandemic. Step 2: Introduce the inciting incident Julia is approached by the hospital administration, who believe her empathetic nature makes her the perfect candidate for the difficult task of notifying families about the death of their loved ones. They explain that their current staff is overwhelmed and needs help with this challenging responsibility. Step 3: Develop the character's motivation and personal stakes Julia accepts the task because she understands the importance of providing closure and comfort to grieving families during such trying times. This task also hits close to home, as she has recently lost her mother to the same pandemic and didn't have a proper chance to say goodbye. Step 4: Introduce supporting characters Throughout the story, we meet different characters in Julia's life, including her supportive but distant husband, her teenage daughter who is struggling with her own grief, and a kind-hearted nurse coworker who helps Julia with this emotionally draining task. Step 5: Introduce conflict and challenges As Julia delivers the news of their loved ones' deaths, she faces diverse reactions from anger and denial to despair and acceptance. Each encounter takes a toll on her mental and emotional well-being, and she struggles to find a balance between her growing responsibility and her personal life. Step 6: Build a turning point or climax Julia becomes overwhelmed with the emotional burden and reaches a breaking point when her best friend's husband falls ill and eventually passes away. Julia must now face the daunting task of delivering the news to her closest friend, which triggers a realization that she is losing herself in the process. Step 7: Resolution After this eye-opening experience, Julia decides to have a heartfelt conversation with the hospital administration about the need for more mental health support for staff in such challenging roles. The administration agrees and begins to implement changes – including counseling and rotating shifts to prevent burnout. Step 8: Wrap up the story with growth Julia, with the support of her family and coworkers, begins to heal from the emotional trauma she has endured. As a result, she becomes a stronger, more resilient person and continues to work in the palliative care unit, but now with better support and a greater understanding of the importance of self-care.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: As he looks up at the Jade Dragon Mountain, Zhang Jinpeng basks in the sunshine on the roof-top of his youth hostel in Lijiang, a popular tourist destination in Yunnan province in Southwest China. He is content and excited at the same time, since the hostel, which he named after his best-seller A Decade of Backpacking, opened earlier this month. Published in 2010, Zhang's book was considered a milestone in Chinese travel writing. It sold more than 600,000 copies and triggered a wave of travel books by other Chinese writers who were born in the late 1970s and 1980s. Different from travel guides and traditional Chinese travel literature that mainly depict landscapes and scenery, these books by young travelers tell stories of their personal growth through traveling. In A Decade of Backpacking, Zhang recounts his travels around the world since 2001, after he graduated from Nan Kai University in Tianjin and decided to see the world. \\"At the time my book came out, there were few books that catered to young people's longing while traveling.\\" Zhang's book ignited a Chinese craze for travel writing. Featuring different themes, travel writing became a popular genre. But most of the books have one thing in common: The travelers are mostly young people. The Late Gap Year (2009), written by Sun Dongchun, tells the story of a young man who gave up a white-collar job and started a three-month trip for a volunteer program in Southeast Asia. The trip turned into a year-long travel. What's more, he even found his Miss Right and got married by the end of the story. We Always Travel Hand in Hand, published in 2012, was written by a young couple. Their travel romance, complete with beautiful pictures, first went viral on a Chinese micro-blog.

The reason behind attributing a positive sentiment to this tweet is the use of welcoming and optimistic phrases. The author begins by greeting their audience with \\"Good Morning all,\\" showing a friendly and approachable demeanor. They then proceed to express their hope that everyone has a great day. In choosing between the provided options, we would choose option (b) positive. This is because a positive sentiment is typically associated with expressions of warmth, optimism, and general goodwill, which are clearly present in this tweet. Conversely, a negative sentiment often involves expressions of anger, frustration, sadness, or dissatisfaction, which are not present in this case. Furthermore, analyzing the specific phrases used in the tweet: - \\"Good Morning all\\" conveys a warm and friendly tone. By addressing everyone, the author seeks to connect with their audience and invite them into a shared experience. - \\"I hope\\" indicates a level of concern and care for others, as the author is not just making a statement but expressing a heartfelt wish. - \\"you all\\" once again emphasizes the inclusive nature of the message, ensuring that it applies to the whole audience and not just a select few. - \\"have a great day\\" is a common and generally positive expression that conveys the author's intent to uplift and encourage their audience.

Please answer this question : Which person studied less about moths? The answer is:","completion":"John studied less about moths than Mary. The given situation states that John liked to study insects that never eat, while Mary decided to study insects that are very healthy eaters. The hint provided mentions that some moths never eat, as their lives are over in just a few hours or days, and after becoming adults, they lay eggs and die. It doesn't explicitly state that all moths fall under this category, which implies that there are other moths that do eat and could be categorized as healthy eaters. Since John focused on studying insects that never eat, and there are some moths which fall under this category, he may have studied those particular moths. However, Mary's focus on studying insects that are very healthy eaters implies that she would have likely studied moths that consume food, as well as other insects. Given the different areas of interest and study for John and Mary, it is evident that Mary's research subject includes a broader range of moths, whereas John's research would only pertain to a specific group of moths that do not eat. Therefore, it can be concluded that John studied less about moths than Mary did."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Aint nothin luxe about the Luxor. From the outside and pics on the website, I thought it looked nice. The lower level where we checked in looked decent too. Once we got to our room though, it was a whole different story. A previous review mentioned that the room would have been cool in 1991. More like 1975. The ugly ass bedspread and curtains looked like they were straight off the set of Sanford & Son, Maude, All in the Family, and The Jeffersons, The bedspread was very cheap and flimsy. The actual bed was hard. The egyptian decor was cheesy. The only nice thing about it was the bathroom. We stayed in east tower and there's a long walk to the room. Our room also smelled like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. My cousin is allergic to smoke so this was a big problem.When we called to complain about a possible room switch, they told us since they gave us a courtesy early check in, they couldn't switch us.

Although Dominic and the early brethren had instituted female Dominican houses at Prouille and other places by 1227, some of the brethren of the order had misgivings about the necessity of female religious establishments in an order whose major purpose was preaching, a duty in which women could not traditionally engage. In spite of these doubts, women's houses dotted the countryside throughout Europe. There were seventy-four Dominican female houses in Germany, forty-two in Italy, nine in France, eight in Spain, six in Bohemia, three in Hungary, and three in Poland. Many of the German religious houses that lodged women had been home to communities of women, such as Beguines, that became Dominican once they were taught by the traveling preachers and put under the jurisdiction of the Dominican authoritative structure. A number of these houses became centers of study and mystical spirituality in the 14th century. There were one hundred and fifty-seven nunneries in the order by 1358. In that year, the number lessened due to disasters like the Black Death. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Who did some early Dominican followers have trouble reconciling?","completion":"Some early Dominican followers had trouble reconciling the necessity of female religious establishments in an order whose major purpose was preaching, a duty in which women could not traditionally engage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sitting bottom of the Aviva Premiership, the Exiles are in desperate need of some comfort and joy. The statistics are damning. The Oxford club have suffered 10 defeats in 10 games and are in danger of becoming only the second team in league history to be relegated without a single victory. These are new experiences for Piri Weepu, their World Cup winning scrum-half. His first three months in the Northern Hemisphere delivered more losses than nine seasons as a New Zealand international, but the veteran is not afraid of mucking in. Former All Blacks scrum half Piri Weepu dives to try and tackle Saracens' Chris Ashton last Saturday. ‘I’ve been in backs-to-the-wall situations before,’ said Weepu. ‘Leading into the World Cup, the All Blacks lost two games in a row. We were expected to win it but we kept focused on what we needed to achieve. ‘The circumstances are different here but we’ve just got to try to overcome it. People need to sell papers and they might talk rubbish about you to do that, but that doesn’t mean we have to buy into it. Comments in the tabloids can ruin your mood if you let them, but we just need to train our backsides off and stay positive.’ Saracens scored 11 tries against Welsh in the 78-7 win, the worst defeat the Exiles have suffered this year. Played 10, Lost 10. Points for 80, Against 490. Average possession per game: 14.41minutes. Goal kicking accuracy: 55%. Missed tackles per game: 28. Turnovers conceded per game: 15. Lineout success: 75%. Scrum success: 78%. Improvements are needed across the board. Welsh have managed less than 15 minutes possession per game this season and have lost by an average of 41 points. They have fired in neither attack nor defence, but one of their most consistent downfalls has been at the set-piece. During their 78-7 defeat by Saracens on Saturday, they lost eight out of 13 lineouts on their own throw. Their scrum did not fare much better and, throughout the season, they have lost 20 per cent of ball on their own feed. This is compounded by an average concession of 15 turnovers per game, leaving the recently promoted side in desperate need of a morale boost. A victory over London Irish on Boxing Day would be the perfect festive tonic, with Irish sitting one place above Welsh in the league. Weepu, for one has not given up hope. Elliot Kear touches down a solitary consolation try for London Welsh, but Weepu insists they are improving. ‘If there’s no belief left, then we probably shouldn’t be in the competition,’ said the 31-year-old. ‘I still love the sport. I still love lacing up the boots and getting amongst it. Even if we’re getting pumped, I still love it. As long as you try your hardest, then that’s all we can really ask. We just need to get our roles right — we create opportunities in games but then we’re not picking the right options.’ Former Wales back row Rowland Phillips was brought in as a defence coach last month in a bid to turn around the club’s fortunes. A losing bonus point against Leicester showed signs of progress, but the Exiles still boast the worst tackle success rate in the league, missing an average of 28 per game. Phillips says there have been statistical improvements over the last seven weeks but is fully aware of the scale of the challenge. Despite the leakiest defence in the league, Rowland Phillips insists the defence is getting tougher. ‘There’s no fairy godmother who’s going to make everything perfect,’ said Phillips. ‘I joined this group about eight weeks ago and the timing meant I couldn’t just rip everything up and start again. It’s hard for me to convince people, but I have seen a certain improvement. There is hunger, but we’re not going to win on pure emotion. We need better structures to earn our right to win. The players know they have to improve and they want to improve.’ Phillips has been tasked with fixing the problems but the roots, he believes, stem from the short summer turnaround. The Exiles were rank outsiders for promotion but beat Bristol through the controversial play-off system. While Bristol had already recruited heavily for what seemed inevitable promotion, Welsh panicked in the transfer market place with sporadic recruitment, signing players on a shoestring budget. Weepu has bags of experience from his time with the All Blacks, and believes his side can turn things around. ‘Things happened pretty quickly,’ said Phillips. ‘The play-off season goes on late and the Premiership starts early, so our training and recruitment were affected by the preparation time. You’ve got a small window, with players coming off a tough Championship season. There’s about a one-week break and then you’re back in. That has a bearing on how your season unfolds. ‘Any gambling man would have bet on Bristol to walk into the Premiership, but it didn’t happen. Some say the system isn’t effective and there should be no promotion or relegation, but we’re trying to get away from a ring-fence mentality. Exeter are an example of a team who got promoted and grew. As soon as you close it off, then that kills off a lot of teams’ ambitions.’ The plight of London Welsh, it seems, will do little for the cause.","completion":"London Welsh has faced severe challenges in the Aviva Premiership, with the team experiencing 10 defeats in 10 games. The situation leaves London Welsh in danger of becoming the second team in league history to be relegated without a single victory.

The team has managed less than 15 minutes possession per game this season, losing by an average of 41 points. A victory against London Irish may have provided a morale boost, but London Welsh still needs to work on numerous areas to avoid relegation. Defense, in particular, needs to be modified with former Wales back row Rowland Phillips being brought in as a defense coach last month. While Phillips claims there have been statistical improvements, much work remains to ensure better overall performance.

His wife, Caroline, is the only one who can truly see the good in him and keeps him grounded. Despite the dark world they live in, they're deeply in love and share a life of glamour and luxury together. Pitt, a rising crime lord from a rival mafia family, envies Murphy's success and is always on the lookout for an opportunity to undermine his power. He knows the only way to weaken Murphy is by taking away his one true vulnerability: Caroline. The movie begins with a series of rapid-fire scenes that demonstrate Murphy's control over the city and his strategic prowess. Extremely cautious by nature, Murphy has managed to keep Caroline's existence and whereabouts a secret from his enemies. However, during a seemingly trivial business deal with a street-level informant named Benny, Murphy slips up and reveals vital information about Caroline's whereabouts. Sensing an opportunity, Benny sells the information to Pitt. Taking advantage of this intelligence, Pitt devises a master plan to kidnap Caroline during a charity event she's hosting. In an intense and riveting sequence, Pitt and his henchmen successfully kidnap Caroline and send Murphy a chilling message: He must relinquish his control over the city or never see his beloved wife again. Murphy, fueled by rage and love, vows to unleash his full wrath upon Pitt and rescue Caroline, no matter the cost. As he starts hunting down Pitt, he partners with an enigmatic and highly-skilled female mercenary named Raven.

Options: a ) 5 , b ) 6 , c ) 9 , d ) 10 , e ) 15 Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the scholarships and their amounts Usage: There are three types of scholarships: - 1250 scholarships: they total 75000 - 2500 scholarships: twice as many as 4000 scholarships - 4000 scholarships: the number needs to be determined I think these meet the criteria because they describe the information given in the problem. Part #2: Identify the relationships between the scholarships Usage: - Twice as many 2500 scholarships as 4000 scholarships - Three times as many 1250 scholarships as 2500 scholarships These ratios are stated in the problem, and they offer a link between the quantities of scholarships awarded in each denomination. Part #3: Determine the number of 1250 scholarships Usage: There were 60 1250 scholarships awarded, as (75000 div 1250 = 60). This information helps us to find the number of 2500 scholarships using the given relationship. Part #4: Determine the number of 2500 scholarships Usage: There were 20 2500 scholarships awarded, as (60 div 3 = 20). Since there are three times as many 1250 scholarships as 2500 scholarships, there must be 20 2500 scholarships given this factor.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the weather is less windy happens, how will it affect MORE erosion by the ocean. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The perturbation of less windy weather may have an indirect effect on the process of ocean erosion. With less wind, there might be a decrease in wave energy, which can lead to smaller or less intense waves hitting the land. Consequently, this situation may somewhat reduce the force of the ocean water pulling sand off of beaches, breaking rocks off of cliffs, and carrying sand and rocks into the ocean. While less windy weather might seem to have a dampening effect on erosion, other factors can still contribute to the overall rate of erosion, such as the strength of ocean currents, tidal forces, and the geological composition of the land.

Options: - deep sea - slaughterhouse - cattle ranch - countryside - barnyard Explain why a human would choose \\"cattle ranch\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"cattle ranch\\" A human would choose \\"cattle ranch\\" as the answer to this question because it is the most logical and relevant option among the choices provided. Cowboys were responsible for overseeing and tending to cattle, moving them from one location to another to ensure they had enough food, water, and could maintain overall well-being. A cattle ranch is a common place where such activities occur, as it is specifically designed to raise and manage cattle. Now, let's analyze the other choices: - \\"deep sea\\": This option is clearly unsuitable, as cows are land animals that cannot survive in a deep sea environment, and cowboys would not be found herding heifers in the ocean. - \\"slaughterhouse\\": While cattle are eventually sent to slaughterhouses for meat production, cowboys themselves are not typically the ones who herd them directly to the slaughterhouse. - \\"countryside\\": While cattle herding can occur in countryside settings, this option is very general and less specific than \\"cattle ranch.\\" Cowboys would typically not herd their cattle through public countryside areas without a specific destination. - \\"barnyard\\": A barnyard is a smaller area attached to a farm where animals are often kept. While cows may be housed in a barnyard, cowboys herd cattle over large distances, and a barnyard would not be a suitable destination for such activities. Considering all these reasons, \\"cattle ranch\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question, as it directly relates to the activities, responsibilities, and purpose of cowboys herding heifers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The pitcher from whom Tatis hit both grand slams was Chan Ho Park, who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers at that time. The remarkable event took place in the third inning of the game, and both home runs were a part of an 11-run scoring spree for the Cardinals, contributing eight of those 11 runs. A grand slam refers to a home run that is hit when all three bases are occupied by runners, thus scoring four runs—the most possible on a single hit in baseball. What made Tatis' feat even more extraordinary was that it had never been done before in the history of Major League Baseball and has not been repeated since. Making this event even more astounding, Tatis hit his two grand slams on the first two pitches from Park, a testament to his abilities as a hitter and his impressive timing. His first slam came with no outs, and his second slam came with two outs. This remarkable achievement not only was a personal accomplishment for Tatis, but it also paved the way for the Cardinals' 12-5 victory over the Dodgers on that particular day. This event is an indelible part of baseball history and continues to be remembered as one of the most striking feats in the sport. Despite facing intense pressure, Park continued his career after that infamous game and even became the first South Korean-born player to be named an All-Star in the MLB in 2001. On the other hand, Fernando Tatis Sr.'s legacy in the sport continues, with his son Fernando Tatis Jr. also becoming a professional baseball player and continually impressing fans with his phenomenal performances. So, to answer your question, Fernando Tatis Sr. hit 2 grand slams off of Chan Ho Park."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer??","completion":"Alright, let's solve this step by step. First, start by simplifying the equation: -507 - 1081 = 25g + 48g + 18 Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. -507 - 1081 = (-1588) (sum of -507 and -1081) 25g + 48g = 73g (sum of 25g and 48g) So now our equation looks like this: -1588 = 73g + 18 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'g' by moving the constant term from the right side to the left side. -1588 - 18 = 73g -1606 = 73g Step 3: Solve for 'g' by dividing both sides by 73. g = -1606 / 73 g ≈ -22 So, g is approximately equal to -22."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein was indicted Wednesday on rape and criminal sex act charges, furthering the first criminal case to arise from a slate of sexual misconduct allegations against the former movie mogul. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said the indictment brings Weinstein \\"another step closer to accountability.\\" The announcement came hours after Weinstein's lawyers said he'd decline to testify before the grand jury because there wasn't enough time to prepare him and \\"political pressure\\" made an indictment unavoidable. A statement issued through a Weinstein spokesman said the 66-year-old film producer, who has denied the allegations, learned of the specific charges and the accusers' identities only after turning himself in Friday. With a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon to testify or not, his request for more time was denied, the statement said. \\"Finally, Mr. Weinstein's attorneys noted that regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein's personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein,\\" the statement said. Vance said in a statement that the Weinstein camp's \\"recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable.\\" \\"We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand,\\" Vance said. Weinstein was charged Friday with raping one woman and committing a criminal sex act by compelling oral sex from another. A grand jury continued hearing evidence in the case, as it had been doing for weeks. Defendants have the right to testify in a grand jury's secret proceedings but often don't, for various reasons. Freed on 1 million bail and electronic monitoring, he was due back in court July 30, though that date may now be moved up in light of the indictment. Beyond the two women involved in the case, dozens more women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault in various locales. He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, and his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Tuesday that Weinstein was \\"confident he's going to clear his name\\" in the New York prosecution. Brafman called the rape allegation \\"absurd,\\" saying that the accuser and Weinstein had a decade-long, consensual sexual relationship that began before and continued after the alleged 2013 attack. The woman, who hasn't been identified publicly, told investigators Weinstein confined her in a hotel room and raped her. The other accuser in the case, former actress Lucia Evans, has gone public with her account of Weinstein forcing her to perform oral sex at his office in 2004. The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly. Vance, a Democrat, came under public pressure from women's groups to prosecute Weinstein after declining to do so in 2015, when an Italian model went to police to say Weinstein had groped her during a meeting. Police set up a sting in which the woman recorded herself confronting Weinstein and him apologizing for his conduct. But Vance decided there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, ordered the state attorney general to investigate how Vance handled that matter. ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on a New York rape case against Harvey Weinstein (all times local): 6:15 p.m. Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says the former film producer will \\"vigorously defend\\" himself after being indicted on rape and other sex crime charges, which he strongly denies.

The trooper, a graduate of Virginia Tech, was run over and killed while directing traffic at the state fair earlier this month. When the photo landed in Virginia Tech police Lt. George Jackson's inbox, he knew it would be a hit. Jackson manages the social media accounts for the college police department and posted the photo Friday in two places on the department's Facebook page.

The next day it had 45,000. By Tuesday it had been shared more than 68,000 times and growing, reaching an estimated 4 million people, according to Facebook's own analytics, Jackson told CNN. He had no explanation for the numbers of shares except to say the comments reveal a community who supported Snow's character. Lane Snow didn't know trooper Fox, but he told local station WDBJ7 he did it because \\"I was sorry that Andrew Fox died.\\" Snow's parents told the station he came up with the idea to dress in uniform and salute the procession on his own.

Know when your fish is about to give birth.\\"","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Breeding Fish: An Emphasis on Guppies Intro: Breeding fish at home can be a rewarding hobby, yielding an explosion of life and color in an aquarium. The process, however, requires careful planning and preparedness to ensure the health and well-being of the fish during and after breeding. In this guide, we’ll dive into the intricate process using guppies as an example, given their popularity and ease of breeding among hobbyists. Step 1: Selecting the Fish The first decision involves determining the type of fish you wish to breed. For this guide, we've opted for guppies, common favorites in the aquarium hobby due to their vibrant colors and live-bearing feature. When selecting your guppies, pay attention to their health, age, and sex. Typically, a ratio of one male to two females is ideal to avoid the males from harassing a single female. Step 2: Choosing the Breeding Tank The breeding tank is the next critical component. The size, shape, and furniture of the tank can significantly affect breeding success. For guppies, a standard 10-20 gallon aquarium provides ample space. It’s advisable to include live plants for hiding spots and to detract attention away from the females during mating. Step 3: Setting Up the Tank Tank setup involves preparing the physical and chemical properties of the aquarium to mirror the fish's natural habitat. Begin with a clean tank, add dechlorinated water, and include an appropriate filter system. Layer the bottom with a fine substrate and introduce live plants for hiding spaces and for providing a natural ecosystem. Step 4: Adjusting the Tank to Your Fish’s Needs Considering guppies originate from calm, warm, tropical waters, replicating this environment is crucial to encourage breeding. Ensure the tank conditions are optimal, with water temperatures between 74°F and 82°F, and a neutral pH around 7.0. A gentle water flow would help mimic their natural river habitats. Regular light exposure, mimicking a day-night cycle, and maintaining a balanced diet for your fish can also contribute to their breeding willingness and overall health. Step 5: Introducing the Guppies to the Breeding Tank Once the tank conditions are ideal, introduce the selected guppies gently into their new habitat. Avoid adding them all at once and consider isolating the males and females initially for a stress-free acclimatization process. Step 6: Observing Signs of Impending Birth One of the most exciting parts of breeding guppies is anticipating their live birth. Guppies, being livebearers, do not lay eggs. Females show a prominent gravid spot near their anal fin, which darkens as she nears birth. A well-rounded belly and distinct change in behavior such as isolation could intimate that your guppy is close to having her fry. In conclusion, breeding guppies, or any fish for that matter, requires careful preparation and a nurturing environment. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to accomplish this task, but remember that patience and attention to detail are critical components to virtue in the delightful journey of fish breeding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There was a large variety of items not generally at buffets this was a plus. About 10 minutes after we arrived our check was provided to us. The server that was assigned to us had a terrible attitude. She made sure to refill my husbands beverage on several occasions. My water was refilled once and I had to ask. Her behavior disturbed me so much that I inquired with management about their protocol with the bill. I was advised the server was probably very busy and didn't realize her actions. I was told don't worry about it just relax and enjoy dinner. Although, it was evident that we needed assistance throughout the evening she consistently went out of her way to provide sub par service. When paying the bill her attitude was still foul. I believe wholeheartedly in compensating individuals who serve others. In this case I could not, which really bothered me. This goes against every fiber in my being. The good thing is that we know not to every visit this restaurant again even if they were to provide dinner on the house.","completion":"This review is negative. The person who wrote the review had a bad experience at the restaurant because the server took a long time to bring their drinks, did not refill their water enough, and had a bad attitude. They also did not like that they were given their bill too early, and they ended up not leaving a tip because the service was subpar.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: The main stage of what can accommodate a full orchestra and chorus of 150 members? Jay Pritzker Pavilion cost 60 million, a quarter of which came from the Pritzker family donation. It includes 4,000 fixed seats and a 95,000-square-foot (8,800 m2) Great Lawn that can accommodate an additional 7,000 people. The pavilion was built above and behind the Harris Theater, which has the benefit that Millennium Park's indoor and outdoor performance venues share a loading dock, rehearsal rooms and other backstage facilities.The bandshell's brushed stainless steel headdress frames the 120-foot (37 m) proscenium theatre; the main stage can accommodate a full orchestra and chorus of 150 members. The bandshell is connected to a trellis of interlocking crisscrossing steel pipes that support the innovative sound system, which mimics indoor concert hall acoustics. The pavilion has restrooms on both its east and west sides. It is one of two features in the park to include accessible restrooms; the other is McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. The majority of the park's 123 toilet fixtures (78 for women, 45 for men) are located in underground arcades to the east and west of the pavilion, with the ones on the east being heated for winter use.Millennium Park is built on top of a large underground parking garage. Construction started before the park's design was completed, and in January 2000, 17 additional caissons had to be added to the partially built garage to support the weight of Gehry's pavilion. In April the tops of all these caissons had to be rebuilt for changes in the pavilion's foundation.U.S. Equities Realty was responsible for negotiating contracts with Gehry and all contractors. Walsh Construction and its subcontractors were hired to execute three elements of Gehry's design: the structural steel supporting the stainless steel ribbons, the ribbons themselves and the trellis and associated sound system.

Article: What is an idiom? An idiom is a group of words which, when used together, has a different meaning from the one which the individual words have. For example, \\"---How do you know that Sid and Nancy have separated ?\\" \\"---I heard it on the grapevine \\". Of course, the second speaker does not mean he heard the news about John by putting his ear to a grapevine! He is conveying the idea visually of information spreading around a widespread network, similar to a grapevine. We use idioms to express something that other words do not express as clearly or as cleverly. We often use an image or symbol to describe something as clearly as possible and thus make our point as effectively as possible. For example, \\"in a nutshell\\" suggests the idea of having all the information contained within very few words. Idioms tend to be informal and are best used in spoken rather than written English. One of the best ways to learn an idiom is by looking at the context in which it is used. This can be done by concentrating on the rest of the sentence and try to guess the meaning. Many idioms are not that difficult to understand when considered in their context. For example: We are going to have a surprise party for Tom tomorrow. It's a secret so please don't let the cat out of the bag. 'Let the cat out of the bag' is an idiom. Imagine you don't know what this idiom means; by looking at the words preceding, it should be easy to guess that the speaker does not want you to tell Tom about the surprise party. Therefore, 'let the cat out of the bag' must mean something like' reveal a secret' or 'tell a secret'.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] Paragraph: The marine biologists studied two areas of the Black Sea. Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the two areas was more oxygenated? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Area B was more oxygenated. According to the paragraph provided, Area A exhibited high levels of water stratification due to the fresh water discharged by the Danube River. In contrast, Area B, located 35 miles south, had less stratified and more oxygenated water. Water stratification can lead to the formation of distinct layers with varied properties like salinity, oxygenation, density, and temperature. These layers act as barriers to water mixing, which can result in decreased oxygen levels in certain parts of the water column, specifically the lower depths. Consequently, regions with less stratification, such as Area B in this scenario, tend to have better oxygenation due to enhanced mixing throughout the entire water column."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Where could she go to find a big cat to see? - front door - residence - zoo - restaurant - barn The best answer is","completion":"The best answer is the zoo. A zoo is the ideal location for someone to see a big cat up close, as it provides a controlled environment where these magnificent creatures are housed, cared for, and protected. Zoos not only endeavor to create a comfortable habitat for the animals but also work towards global conservation and breeding programs for endangered species. Many zoos today are shifting their focus to prioritize animal welfare, and education of visitors is also an integral part of their mission. Some of the big cats one can expect to see at a zoo include lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars. These are all apex predators in their respective ecosystems, and seeing them up close can provide a better understanding and appreciation of these powerful and beautiful creatures. Visiting the front door or a residence might not present the opportunity to see a big cat, as these are private spaces where the occupants may not own any such animals. It is also important to recognize that keeping big cats as pets can be highly dangerous and, in many places, illegal due to the risks involved. A restaurant is similarly an unlikely location to encounter a big cat since their focus is primarily on providing food and dining experiences to patrons. Big cats require specialized care and facilities that restaurants are not equipped to handle. Lastly, visiting a barn might also prove ineffective, as barns are usually associated with domesticated farm animals like horses, cows, pigs, and chickens. While it is not impossible for someone to keep a big cat in a barn, it is highly unlikely given the requirements for specialized care, resources, and the need for an enclosed habitat. In conclusion, the best option for someone interested in seeing a big cat is to visit a zoo, where these beautiful animals are housed in specialized enclosures with professionals attending to their needs. Zoos also provide educational programs and opportunities for visitors to learn about big cats and other wildlife, promoting understanding and conservation efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property.

Tara Maclay is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003). She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed by Amber Benson. Tara is a shy young woman with magical talents who falls in love with Willow Rosenberg, one of the core characters. Together, they help Buffy Summers, who has been given superhuman powers to defeat evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Tara becomes more outspoken during the sixth season about the ethics of Willow's use of magic, cautioning Willow that she depends too much on it. The dynamics of their relationship suddenly turn during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". Willow had cast a spell on Tara to alter her memory in the preceding episode and Tara finds out about it during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\", the musical episode of the series. Tara was given a prominent role in the musical due to the skill of Benson's voice: she sings a love ballad to Willow, a duet with Giles, and backup in two other songs. The musical nature of the episode compelled the characters to express what they had been feeling secretly, or had refused to admit to themselves. Tara's song is a fervent and explicit expression of love for Willow which she had not made clear to the audience until this point. Tara later sings with Giles that she will leave Willow if she does not change. Self-conscious about her singing abilities, Hannigan requested not to be given a song and sings only a few lines in the episode. Critics saw this as Tara's personality becoming more forceful as Willow begins to show signs of weakness as she is overtaken by her addiction. Tara challenges Willow to go for a week without using any magic. Willow almost immediately breaks her promise, however, and Tara leaves her at the end of \\"Tabula Rasa\\". Tara remains a part of the group, spending time with Dawn, and non-judgmentally acting as Buffy's confessor when Buffy divulges she has a painful and compulsive sexual relationship with Spike, a vampire whom she loathes. Despite their separation, Tara remains devoted to Willow's recovery and supports her in her decision to abstain from using magic. She is, according to author Lorna Jowett, one of the few characters who is never seduced by evil. Shuttleworth notes that most Buffy characters go through a rite of transformation except for Tara. Among female characters she is the most virtuous. Like the other Buffy characters in the series whose names have symbolic interpretations, Tara's name resembles the Latin terra, meaning \\"earth.\\" She is solidly grounded, with Willow attached to her, and Benson's body more naturally representative of women. Tara is wholly feminine both in dress and demeanor, as opposed to Buffy and (less) Willow mostly dressed with trousers and jackets, but never seeks male approval. She is clad in earthy, natural colors, long flowing skirts and clinging blouses, with an intent to comfort instead of arouse as other women on the show are dressed. Her admonishments to other characters are always made with love, with their best interests at heart. Even Tara's last words, commenting that Willow's shirt is stained (with Tara's own blood), indicate her preoccupation with the welfare of others. Tara has also appeared in The Long Way Home, Always Darkest, Retreat, and the one-off Willow.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.

Identify and understand the context: The subjects mentioned are likely referring to famous actors, suggesting a comparison between them. Grant and Cary likely refer to Hugh Grant and Cary Grant, while Bullock and Katherine likely refer to Sandra Bullock and Katherine Hepburn. 4. Analyze the main verbs: \\"is n't\\" is used in the sentence, which is a contraction for \\"is not.\\" This indicates that the phrase is making a negation, stating that Hugh Grant is not the same as Cary Grant, and Sandra Bullock is not the same as Katherine Hepburn. 5. Determine the tone: The tone of the phrase appears to be neutral or negative, as it is emphasizing the differences between the actors and suggesting they do not have the same qualities, popularity, or talents. 6.

Summarize this article: Teacher's killer gets life By Kirk Mitchell and Howard Pankratz Denver Post Staff Writers Nov. 4, 2000 - A Denver teenager was sentenced Friday to life in prison without parole just hours after a jury convicted him of killing schoolteacher Emily Johnson. \\"It's just too bad that one stupid, stupid night had to ruin so many lives,\\" said a tearful Marcy Johnson, Emily's sister. TYPES OF MURDER A Denver jury convicted 15-year-old Lorenzo Rubin Montoya Jr. on Friday of felony murder, not finding enough evidence of premeditation. The two types of first-degree murder in Colorado: Murder after deliberation Felony murder To prove premeditated murder, or murder after deliberation, prosecutors must convince a jury that a defendant not only intended to cause the death of another person but that he or she acted after deliberation. To prove felony murder, prosecutors must show that during the commission of a felony - specifically, arson, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, or sexual assault - or while escaping from such a crime, a person died. After 14 hours of deliberations that had erupted in shouting matches, jurors convicted 15-year-old Lorenzo Rubin Montoya Jr. of first-degree felony murder, robbery, auto theft and burglary. The slight, wiry boy with a crew cut sat slouching with head bowed, his eyes red from crying. Denver District Judge Lawrence Manzanares took the unusual step of immediately sentencing him to mandatory life in prison, plus 10 more years for robbery and four concurrent years for auto theft. Police say Montoya and two other teens attacked Johnson, 29, in her northwest Denver home on New Year's Day. They went to her house to steal her Lexus and go joy riding, and when she wouldn't hand over her keys, they beat her with rocks and her own high-heeled shoes, police say. A neighbor found the Skinner Middle School special-education teacher and girls' basketball coach on her back patio the next morning covered in blood. She died 36 hours later. Charges were dropped against one of the suspects, but 17-year-old Nicholas David Martinez faces trial in February. \\"Oh my God, oh my baby,\\" Montoya's mother, Mary Torres, wailed as sheriff's deputies led away her son. \\"Our juvenile justice system has evolved to this: Lock 'em up and throw away the key,\\" said Montoya's attorney, Gina Bischofs. \\"It's compounding the horrible tragedy to Emily Johnson.\\" Jury foreman Mark Meigs said deliberations were emotional. \\"It was real trying, and a lot of the jury didn't want to be here after the second day,\\" he said. \\"We told each other we had to keep it together and have faith we could do the right thing.\\" He said the gruesome details of the crime, spelled out over the weeklong trial, were troubling. \\"The evidence was gory,\\" Meigs said. \\"They had sleepless nights.\\" He said jurors didn't believe witnesses who tried to provide Montoya with an alibi. Those witnesses said Montoya was at his girlfriend's brother's house watching videos and then watching fireworks. Meigs also said jurors believed the testimony of Matthew Hernandez, a 16-year-old cellmate of Montoya. Hernandez said Montoya told him all about the attack. Still, Meigs, the father of four children ages 10 to 18, said it was difficult to send Montoya to prison for the rest of his life. Montoya was ineligible for the death penalty because he's under 18 \\"You wonder what was going on in his life and his family,\\" Meigs said. \\"A lot of jurors had sympathy for him because he just didn't seem like that kind of kid.\\" Judge Manzanares agreed Montoya wasn't the ringleader but he was still culpable. Neither Montoya nor any of his family addressed the court on his behalf before the sentencing. Montoya, who was 14 at the time of the attack, confessed to police that he and some friends had gone to Johnson's house to steal her car. He gave police a two-hour, detailed statement about the attack, saying he was so high on marijuana he didn't know what he was doing. But jurors never got to hear about the bulk of the interview. Manzanares had ruled it inadmissible because the boy's mother wasn't present for about 90 minutes of the questioning. In the police interview, Montoya said he, Martinez and a third youth broke into Johnson's house through the back door by ripping off boards that covered the milk chute. Hernandez testified that Montoya told him the youths forced their way in through the front door. The teens stomped on Johnson's hands and wrists after she refused to give up the car keys, threatening to kill her if she wouldn't hand them over, Hernandez testified. Johnson was then dragged outside, beaten with a softball-size rock and left for dead. Her attackers fled in her newly purchased 1994 Lexus ES300. Montoya's fingerprint was found on the car. Prosecutors also said Montoya left behind the bright-orange Broncos jacket he was wearing that night and that his shoes left footprints in Johnson's blood. Deputy District Attorney Curt Alfrey said if Montoya and his accomplices had stopped the attack after beating Johnson into unconsciousness, she might have lived. But they dragged her out of the house and smashed her head with a large rock, he said. \\"The decision sealed her fate,\\" he said. \\"After everything that happened, they still stole the car.\\" Staff writer Cindy Brovsky contributed to this report.

Return to top ||||| A man sentenced to life in prison after he allegedly was coerced at age 14 into confessing to the infamous murder of a teacher has sued Denver and various police officers in federal court for 30 million, citing civil rights violations. Lawrence Rubin Montoya, 31, served 13 years, seven months and 13 days in prison “for a crime he didn’t commit” before his release in 2014 after his conviction was overturned in the death of Denver school teacher Emily Johnson. Montoya was sentenced to life in prison even though no physical evidence tied him to the scene of the crime, according to the lawsuit. New York City attorneys Jane Fisher-Byrialsen, David N. Fisher and Kaitlin F. Nares filed the 77-page lawsuit in Denver federal court late Tuesday seeking compensatory and punitive damages, economic losses and attorneys fees. They are requesting a trial by jury. Johnson was beaten to death after attending a 1999 New Year’s Eve party at Liquid nightclub. She returned home at 2:10 a.m. in a white Lexus that was stolen. A neighbor found her in her backyard barely breathing at 8:30 a.m. Jan. 1, 2000. She had been raped and severely beaten. She died of her injuries. Between 2:10 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., Montoya was at the home of his girlfriend at 4160 Ames St. and was not involved, the lawsuit says. Homicide detectives took Montoya to police headquarters at 8 p.m. Jan. 10, 2000, and interviewed him for 2½ hours, during which time he denied 65 times being in Johnson’s home or having anything to do with the murder. But after detectives Martin Vigil and Michael Martinez and former police Lt. Jonathan Priest used techniques including “false evidence ploy, manipulation, minimization, threats, false promises,” Montoya succumbed to the pressure and confessed falsely, the lawsuit says. According to the lawsuit, during the interview, detectives cornered Lawrence against the wall in his chair, got in his face, banged the table, yelled at him, stood over him, told him he was not going home, told him he was going to prison for life and that he should be afraid and that he should say goodbye to his mother. Montoya’s confessions were the sole basis for probable cause in his arrest on Jan. 11, 2000, the lawsuit says. Although Johnson’s attack was very violent, leaving blood all over her house and the yard, none of his blood, fiber, hair or palm prints were found at the scene, it says. “Having coerced Lawrence‘s confession and with no evidence, whatsoever, connecting Lawrence to Emily Johnson‘s assault and subsequent death, or the theft of her car, in concert or conspiracy, defendants maliciously and baselessly caused Lawrence to be arrested and prosecuted with the serious charges of felony murder, aggravated robbery, first degree burglary and aggravated vehicle theft,” the lawsuit says. He was sentenced to life without parole Nov. 3, 2000. After professing his innocence thereafter in a series of appeals, Montoya’s charges were dismissed on June 16, 2014. He pleaded guilty the same day to accessory after the fact, admitting he was in the stolen Lexus later in the day on Jan. 1, 2000, and did not go to authorities when other suspects told him they hit a lady with a rock, the lawsuit says. He had been inside the car for 20 minutes “joyriding” with several others who were not arrested in the murder, the lawsuit says. Nicholas Martinez, Luke Anaya and Lloyd Martinez and not Montoya murdered Johnson, the lawsuit says. ||||| DENVER (CBS4) – A man walked out of prison Monday after a court in Denver vacated his murder conviction. Lorenzo Montoya, 29, was convicted nearly 14 years ago in the murder of a Denver teacher. Now with a plea deal Montoya was set free after his lawyers say new evidence cast doubt on his guilt. Only CBS4 was on hand as Montoya hugged his mother as a free man. Montoya’s life sentence for the murder of 29-year-old Emily Johnson in 2000 was vacated in exchange for his pleading guilty to accessory to murder. Johnson was a special education teacher at Skinner Middle School in northwest Denver. “He was 14 at the time of the murder and was accused of accompanying 16-year-old co-defendant Nicholas Martinez, 30, in what began as an effort to steal Johnson’s car, but ended in her murder,” Lynn Kimbrough with the Denver District Attorney’s Office said. According to Kimbrough, “Johnson’s family, the original prosecutors on the case and others involved in the investigation, determined that allowing Montoya to plead guilty to being accessory was in the interest of justice.” Kimbrough said Johnson’s family said they wanted to “speak with Emily’s voice and heart, and that she would want Montoya to have another chance.” After the plea deal Montoya was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Since he already served nearly 14 years he was immediately released. Defense attorney Lisa Polanski had been working on Montoya’s case since 2011 when she took the case on pro bono. “He was falsely accused and wrongfully convicted,” Polanski told CBS4. “He didn’t trust the system at all.” The district attorney’s office refutes Polanski’s claim that Montoya was wrongfully convicted, however. “He declined a plea offer in 2000 that would have resulted in a 6-year sentence to the Youthful Offender System. Instead, he took his case to trial, as was his right, and he was found guilty of felony murder,” the district attorney’s office said in a statement. “The accusation was that he had been the lookout and knew that he was in the victim’s stolen car and that she had been attacked. In fact, Mr. Montoya admitted this.” In a 91-page petition for a new trial Polanski argued that the then 14-year-old’s attorney failed him and new evidence proved his innocence. “We had done some DNA testing on some physical evidence and found that it exonerated our client,” Polanski said. The district attorney’s office also disagreed with Polanski saying, “This is not a DNA exoneration case. There were no court proceedings that litigated any new DNA evidence.” “We always believed he was lookout,” Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey said. Morrissey says instead of a new trial Montoya agreed to plead guilty to accessory to murder since he admitted to being inside the Johnson’s stolen car the next day. “We felt that this was a just result in this situation,” Morrissey said. “This was essentially a compromise in order to get my client out free where he should be,” Palanski said. Montoya was one of the about 50 cases in Colorado of juveniles convicted to life behind bars — a sentence now deemed unconstitutional. Those inmates’ cases are currently awaiting a decision from the Colorado Supreme Court. |||||","completion":"In November 2000, Lorenzo Rubin Montoya Jr., a 15-year-old Denver teenager, was convicted of first-degree felony murder, robbery, auto theft, and burglary, resulting in a life sentence without parole. Montoya was found guilty for the murder of schoolteacher Emily Johnson after he and two other teens allegedly attacked her and stole her car. Shortly after the trial, Montoya confessed to several aspects of the crime while in jail. Although he was ineligible for the death penalty due to being under 18, Montoya received a heavy sentence due to the heinous nature of the crimes. In a dramatic turn of events, Montoya's original conviction was vacated in 2014 after new evidence cast doubt on his guilt, and his life sentence was changed to a 10-year sentence upon pleading guilty to being an accessory to murder. By this point, Montoya had already served nearly 14 years in prison and was subsequently released. Montoya's lawyers, who worked pro bono on his case since 2011, maintain that he was falsely accused and wrongfully convicted. The District Attorney's Office contends that while Montoya might not have directly killed Johnson, he was at least an accessory in the crime, thus justifying the amended conviction and sentence. Montoya's case highlights the complexities and nuances of the criminal justice system, particularly in situations where a young defendant's guilt is not entirely clear-cut. Society must grapple with the balance between administering appropriate punishment and providing opportunities for redemption for those convicted of such serious crimes at a young age."},{"prompt":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Andy Kelp seeks his brother-in-law to aid in a job for who? After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter. John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state. And, state C is in gaseous state. He needs to determine the properties of each state. In which state the distance between particles are smaller, state B or state C? Answer:","completion":"In this scenario, John is examining three states of matter: state A (solid), state B (liquid), and state C (gas). When comparing state B (liquid) and state C (gas), we can analyze the properties of each state based on the distance between their respective particles. The distance between particles is significantly affected by the state of matter. In the solid state, particles are held tightly together in a fixed, rigid structure, resulting in relatively small distances between them. The liquid state allows for more mobility, as particles are able to move and slide past each other within the confines of a fixed volume. While the distances between particles in a liquid state are still relatively small, they are larger than the distances in the solid state. In contrast, the gaseous state exhibits the greatest distance between particles. These particles move freely and independently, without any specific or fixed structure. Gas particles occupy the entire available space of their container, spreading out and expanding as necessary. Due to this lack of structure and increased freedom of movement, the distances between particles in the gaseous state are considerably larger than those found in the solid and liquid states. Based on this analysis, the distance between particles is smaller in state B (liquid) than it is in state C (gas). The particles in state B are more closely packed together compared to the particles in state C, which are dispersed more loosely throughout the available space."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas.

News article: What Obama's gun agenda really means for Americans This is a rush transcript from \\"Hannity,\\" February 4, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Our \\"campaigner in chief\\" pounds the pavement yet once again like it's election season. He is desperately trying to push through stricter gun control laws. \\"The anointed one\\" with his soaring rhetoric took his case today to the people of Minnesota and made one thing loud and clear about his gun control policies -- it's not a perfect solution. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There won't be perfect solutions, we're not going to save every life, but we can make a difference. That is our responsibility as Americans. That is what I'll do every single day as long as I've got the honor of serving as your president. HANNITY: Not a perfect solution. Now make no mistake about what Obama is doing today. It's a blatant move to undercut the NRA. He is trying to directly appeal to their membership, and as he spoke in front of the Minneapolis Police Department claiming gun owners support his common sense gun control measures. Now it's senseless arguments like this that literally do nothing to advance even his cause. OBAMA: If we still had a ten round limit on magazines, for example, the gunman who shot Gabby may never have been able to inflict 33 gunshot wounds in 15 seconds -- 15 seconds, 33 rounds fired. Some of the six people who lost their lives that day in Tucson might still be with us. HANNITY: All right, there is no way that he can draw that conclusion. Mr. President, that is what we call rampant speculation. Now the president is pressing for a ban on military-style firearms and universal background checks for gun buyers. By the way, something the NRA vehemently claims is nothing more than a way to punish good law abiding citizens. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \\"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\\") WAYNE LAPIERRE, EXECUTIVE V.P., CEO, NRA: It's a fraud to call it universal. It will never be universal. The criminals aren't going to comply with it. They could care less. You are not going to computerize the mental health records. Here's what's going to happen. We ought to quick calling it a universal check. The real title ought to be, the check on law abiding people all over this country. HANNITY: All right, two things to take away from his campaign today and what was nothing short of a stunt. One, what you are seeing is an opportunistic president attempting to push through legislation that may look good, but clearly does not need to make sense. Now number two, this is a president who continues to have misplaced priorities. Where is the same attention and intensity when it comes to the lack of jobs and 50 million Americans on food stamps? Now we learned last week that the economy actually was shrinking and unemployment is back up to 7.9 percent. And as all this news is pouring out, here is what the president is addressing. OBAMA: I am here today because the time has come for common sense, comprehensive immigration reform. OBAMA: My attitude is that gays and lesbians should have access and opportunity the same way everybo dy else does in every institution and walk of life. OBAMA: The only way we can reduce gun violence in this country is if the American people decide it is important, if you decide it is important. If parents and teachers, police officers and pastors, hunters and sportsman, Americans of every background stand up and say it's got to be different. HANNITY: Here, of course, with reaction, author and columnist, the one and only, Ann Coulter. By the way, did you see the picture of the president skeet shooting, which he finally revealed? Notice, first of all when you skeet shooting you shoot up. Number one, he is not even holding it right. ANN COULTER, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: No I think he has someone holding the clay for him. The great constitutional law scholar apparently believes the Second Amendment is because the framers of the Constitution really like skeet shooting. No, that is not what it is about. Waiting for the photos of him taking birth control pills to show him fighting the war on women. HANNITY: All right, let's go to what is interesting here. The president right now only wants to talk about -- gay scout masters, apparently accepting gay scout masters, gay marriage, gun control, watering down welfare requirements, abortion rights, war on women. Everything but the bad economy. Strategic, purposeful? COULTER: Yes, but I would like to concentrate on the lies being repeated on the op-ed page of The New York Times and editorials why the president himself, he says if we want to do something to reduce these gun shootings all we have to do is for the American people to want to do something like the hunters. No, we need the ACLU and the liberals who will not do anything about the mentally ill to be serious about stopping these shootings. This kid that was kidnapped in Alabama and finally released today, that was crazy man that took him. Everyone knew he was crazy. The American sniper, this great American male, more American shots at the enemy than any other military man, he was killed by a man with a history of mental problems. HANNITY: Oh by the way, he listens to conservative talk radio. COULTER: Connecticut, Aurora, Tucson, these are crazy people. That is the problem. Everything they are telling you about what they can do about guns is lie. The problem with universal background checks is we basically have universal backgrounds check now. Any licensed gun dealer is performing a background check. The buyer may not know or the gun show may not know, but if you are walking through a gun show, everybody is doing background checks. The only people who are not subjected to background checks are collectors, giving guns to their sons or selling one to their brother in law or something. The only way to enforce a universal -- the last 0.1 percent of guns that are transferred by collectors and so on is to have universal gun registration. That is an important point. For some reason, Wayne Lapierre is not making it so you're going to have to hear it from me. Universal background check means universal registration, universal registration means universal confiscation, universal extermination. That is how it goes in history. Do not fall for universal background checks. Point two of this thing about how in The New York Times editorial page today or yesterday and from the hearings last week, that a gun in the home is more likely to be used against the owner than to kill an intruder. Two points about that. The whole thing is a lie. That is because most ways a gun in the home is used to kill someone is suicide. That is more than 90 percent of those cases. You might say, having a gun they are going to commit suicide and they wouldn't have otherwise. No, that is false. Suicide rates do not go up with the availability of guns. The Japanese for example have no guns. They have twice the highest suicide rate. You see the same thing state to state. No matter what gun laws are, suicide rates have nothing to do with that. And finally, what we only count, a homeowner repelling an intruder if he murders him and kills him? How about he holds them until the police arrive. That doesn't count in the equation. That is why they are telling you in order to prevent Americans from self-defense, from protecting themselves, so only the government has a monopoly on guns. HANNITY: Let me ask you, because I think it fits with the narrative. If Obama talks about gay rights, if Obama talks about guns, immigration and climate control, then the media race to every Republican, \\"What do you think about what Obama said?,\\" and we don't focus on the economy. One other issue -- COULTER: Not only that just to follow up on your point right there. It's just that they are talking about it, they must demonize people that are legal gun owners and, \\"Obama, look at him. He cares about the children.\\" Screw you. You think we don't care about the children? You're the one who won't do anything about the mentally ill. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted, while Léon Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a \\"direct citation\\" of Ingres' portrait. Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, \\"Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference\\". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her \\"massive, monumental presence\\". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, \\"That's Madame Bertin!\\"The influence continued through the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of Ralph Vaughan Williams between 1952 and 1961. In 1975 Marcel Broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.

Article: In the past, if a person wanted to see the national treasures of a country, one had to go there in person. Therefore, very few people were able to enjoy some of history's most important and interesting artifacts . This has changed with an increase in the number of traveling museum exhibitions. King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more.

Context: There is disagreement about the origin of the term, but general consensus that \\"cardinalis\\" from the word cardo (meaning 'pivot' or 'hinge') was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \\"superior.\\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \\"title\\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.","completion":"Before 1059, a cardinal was eligible to become pope, as decreed by a synod in 769."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Jon Krakauer will release Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town on April 21. For his next book, Jon Krakauer looked into a series of campus rapes at the University of Montana after he learned that a close family friend had been raped by a man she trusted. Mr Krakauer announced Monday that he would release 'Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town' on April 21. The best-selling author says that the story 'makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault'. He has previously written narrative non-fiction about topical issues, including a biography of football player and soldier Pat Tillman. The book's release in April follows several years where sexual assaults and how they are handled by universities have gotten increased attention. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012, according to Mr Krakauer's website. The Colorado-based journalist says the new book 'chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula' with both the police system and their university. The book purportedly tells how one district attorney testified for an alleged rapist during university proceedings against him. She later left the prosecutor's office, becoming an attorney for the university's star football player who was accused on rape. The Department of Justice began an investigation into Missoula County in May 2012 after receiving complaints about the way officials handled rapes reported by University of Montana students. A June 2014 agreement ended the investigation, with the county agreeing to training and special prosecutors for sexual assault cases. The university itself has created a small sexual assault prevention department last year with a coordinator and three interns, according to the Montana Kaimin. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012. While Mr Krakauer's story focuses on Montana, the book's scope is more global. Missoula is described as 'a typical college town' and Mr Krakauer's website said that rape victims are 'deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken'. Mr Krakauer decided to write the book 'after learning that a young woman with whom he and his wife have a close relationship suffered intensely in secret for many years after she was raped by a man she trusted,' according to USA Today. Sexual assault and rape have become issues at campuses across the country, with victims speaking out against the way that universities dealt with their allegations. Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia University attended the State of the Union with New York Senator Kristen Gillbrand after carrying a mattress around to classes in protest against her alleged attacker's continued presence on campus. Mr Krakauer, pictured speaking in 2009, is the best selling author of works such as Into Thin Air and Into the Wild. President Obama sent a pre-recorded message to the Grammys on Sunday urging artists to advocate against sexual and domestic violence. Ninety-four colleges and universities were under investigation by the Department of Justice for their handling of sexual assault cases as of the beginning of this year. Mr Krakauer's book says that it 'cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape'. The writer's other works include Into the Wild, Under the Banner of Heaven and Into Thin Air, for which he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.

What is the title of this article: A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that 467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period. The majority of these were prime loans. Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998, but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all sub-prime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of sub-prime loans had some connection with CRA. In addition, an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in 2009, however, concluded that the CRA was not responsible for the mortgage loan crisis, pointing out that CRA rules have been in place since 1995 whereas the poor lending emerged only a decade later. Furthermore, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA, especially in the years 2005–2006 leading up to the crisis. Nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending.","completion":"Title: \\"The Role of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in Mortgage Lending: A Comprehensive Analysis of U.S. Lending Trends and the Impact on Subprime Loans from 1993-1998\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question In his Physics, book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue ad infinitum, there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular. Although Lucretius argued for the existence of vacuum in the first century BC and Hero of Alexandria tried unsuccessfully to create an artificial vacuum in the first century AD, it was European scholars such as Roger Bacon, Blasius of Parma and Walter Burley in the 13th and 14th century who focused considerable attention on these issues. Eventually following Stoic physics in this instance, scholars from the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the Aristotelian perspective in favor of a supernatural void beyond the confines of the cosmos itself, a conclusion widely acknowledged by the 17th century, which helped to segregate natural and theological concerns.

Article: Idris' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system in order to take advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.

Kim inherited some grassland, while Jane inherited a forest. They both took good care of their properties. But I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. What is an answer for this question: Which person inherited a parcel where fewer fires occurred? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Jane, who inherited the forest, has a parcel where fewer fires occurred.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: At the Academy Awards ceremony on March 27, 1957, Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her torrid, over-the-top portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a Texas oil tycoon in WRITTEN ON THE WIND. The 1956 potboiler, adapted from Robert Wilder's novel , was a veritable three-ring-circus showcasing alcoholism, greed, impotence and nymphomania. Malone's performance as Marylee Hadley , a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart, was representative of the movie as a whole. Mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the \\"lowest -common- denominator\\" melodrama, WRITTEN ON THE WIND is ultimately the work of one man, the incredibly gifted director Douglas Sirk, an émigré from pre -World War 2 Weimar Germany who left his European theater heritage behind to pursue a career in Hollywood. An extremely erudite man, Sirk made a name for himself in the 1950's as Universal Studios' reliable director of lavish soap operas, most notably with Ross Hunter's productions of MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION , ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS and IMITATION OF LIFE . Independent producer Albert Zugsmith offered Sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of Universal's demure entertainments and create a more adult , \\"sensational\\" product , hence the sultry WIND and its follow-up, 1957's TARNISHED ANGELS, both released under the Universal International banner. It's anyone's guess why Sirk didn't pursue loftier themes, but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities. WRITTEN ON THE WIND could be considered Sirk's epic soap opera ; indeed, it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous, perhaps more so. Robert Stack (not an actor typically known for over -emoting) nearly matches Malone in intensity with his offering of the weak- willed brother Kyle Hadley, a mere shadow of his patriarchal father. When he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride ( a beautifully leonine Lauren Bacall ) , Hadley goes off the deep end, escalating an already serious drinking problem with a \\"secret \\" gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb. Both brother and sister, as venal and unlikeable as they are, are presented as victims of their past, giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous ( and far more interesting than the 'good\\" side of the family, mainly Bacall and the impossibly handsome Rock Hudson , young Hadley's old boyhood friend and business associate, a surrogate son to the old man and Malone' s unattainable object of desire. ) Despite all the domestic co-dependency on display , it's not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed. With a real panache for pictorial composition and editing, director Sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened Technicolor cinematography imaginable : every single shot in this film is an eye-filling canvas of saturated colors, from the sight of a tank-like pink Cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion's front doors to the garish decor of a luxury Miami hotel , a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity. Action and dramatic scenes feature Sirk's adept use of tilted camera angles , shadowy lighting and cross-cut editing , shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious , drunken Malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase ; the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold. What you're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind, gussied up in lurid Technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mainly positive. The reviewer talks about the captivating performances, the amazing directing by Douglas Sirk, and the eye-catching cinematography. They mention that the movie is filled with intense emotions and dramatic scenes, making it very entertaining to watch. However, they also describe the story as over-the-top and exaggerated, calling it \\"trash of an enormously entertaining kind\\", which adds a slightly negative tone. Overall, the reviewer seems to enjoy the movie and its ability to keep the audience engaged."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Halberstadt is a town in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, the capital of Harz district. Located north of the Harz mountain range, it is known for its old town centre that was severely damaged in World War II and rebuilt in the following decades. - Israel Jacobson ( October 17 , 1768 , Halberstadt -- September 14 , 1828 , Berlin ) was a German - Jewish philanthropist and communal organiser . While he lacked a systematic religious approach , he is considered one of the heralds of Reform Judaism . - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\".

It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Reform Judaism (also known as Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) is a major Jewish denomination which emphasizes the evolving nature of the religion, the superiority of its ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones, and a belief in a continuous revelation not centered on the theophany at Mount Sinai. It is characterized by a lesser stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as of basically non-binding nature, and great openness to external influences and progressive values. The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates. Its greatest center today is in North America. - Abraham Geiger (24 May 181023 October 1874) was a German rabbi and scholar, considered the founding father of Reform Judaism. Emphasizing its constant development along history and universalist traits, Geiger sought to reformulate received forms and design what he regarded as a religion compliant with modern times. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The Harz is the highest mountain range in Northern Germany and its rugged terrain extends across parts of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. The name \\"Harz\\" derives from the Middle High German word \\"Hardt\\" or \\"Hart\\" (mountain forest), Latinized as \\"Hercynia\\".

Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment. - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic.

Article: Peter Jackson, currently one of the world's most well-known directors and the unofficial face of the entire nation of New Zealand, was born on October 31, 1961 in Pukerua Bay, New Zealand. He liked to take photographs, so a family friend bought the young Jackson a super 8mm camera. He has been a filmmaker even since. At age nine he even attempted to remake his favorite film, King Kong, using his own stop-motion effect. Unlike many of the filmmakers working today, Jackson never went to film school. Instead he created his own short films with the help of family and friends. He was turned down for a job at the National Film Unit, New Zealand's government agency that produces tourist films about the country. With that avenue closed, Jackson began working other jobs to support himself, while shooting shorts on the weekend. One of these weekend films, expanded from its original ten minutes length into a feature film. The project took four years to complete (1983-1987)and was called Bad Taste. After the success of Bad Taste, Jackson became recognized as a director and the door to fame and fortune was opened. He gave up his job at a local photographer's shop and became a well-known director of horror-movies. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is obviously a huge landmark in Jackson's career, not only did the films become some of the most commercially successful of all time, _ His digital effects company, WETA Digital, became one of, if not the most respected effects company in the world; similarly, Jackson has also expressed an interest in returning to his roots and directing some lower-budget splatter films again.

Well, that's sort of what happened in a far away icy place called Antarctica. Some researchers from New Zealand found a really really old fruitcake, that's a cake made with pieces of fruit in it. They think the cake was brought there by a man named Robert Falcon Scott and his team in 1911. The cake was kept inside a tin, like a lunch box, and as the place is super-cold almost all the time, the cake never got spoiled. The cake still looks new, but it smells a bit of old butter. But no one is going to try a bite of it, because people working with old things like this don't taste them, that's an important rule they have.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Question: suppose \\"earth doesnt have a volcano\\" happens, how will it affect magma transforms into a volcano above the earth. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If the hypothetical situation \\"earth doesn't have a volcano\\" were to happen, it would significantly affect the way magma transforms into a volcano above the earth, as well as influence the second effect mentioned: the gases coming to a head and pushing molten magma to the surface. In this scenario, without the presence of any volcanoes on Earth, the process of a volcanic eruption would be fundamentally altered. Volcanoes serve as natural conduits for magma to rise from the Earth's mantle to its crust and eventually erupt as lava. Without these conduits, the movement of magma to the surface would become restricted and other geological processes would need to take charge for the release of magma and pressure. Without volcanoes, one option is that the pressure of the gases and magma beneath the Earth's crust could build up until weak points or fissures in the crust are formed. In this case, magma could still be forced to the surface, although the result might not resemble the volcanic eruptions we are familiar with today. This could lead to less frequent and less predictable explosive events, as these weak points would not be as established as the volcanic conduits we have today. In terms of the second effect mentioned, where gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface, the perturbation caused by the absence of volcanoes would have a \\"less\\" effect. Without the presence of volcanoes or volcanic conduits, the gases would have a reduced ability to accumulate and be focused at specific points of release. This would complicate and diminish the pressure-driven process that forces magma to the surface. Gases would still be produced within the mantle, but without any specific release points, the distribution of gases would be more widespread beneath the Earth's crust. This would lead to a reduction in localized pressure, thus having a less apparent effect on the pushing magma to the surface. To summarize, a situation where the Earth doesn't have any volcanoes would have a significant impact on the process of magma transforming into a volcano and the effect of gas pressure forcing magma to the surface. The absence of volcanoes would lead to less ability for gases to accumulate and push molten magma to the surface, disrupting the natural volcanic eruption process and forcing alternative geological processes to take place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. Paragraph: The ecologist moved from Aspen, where there was no air pollution, to Seattle which experienced a lot of air pollution.

Frying the paneer cubes is the most logical next step to proceed with the Kashmiri style paneer curry recipe. Frying will help provide a crispy and firm texture to the paneer, which is essential for the preparation of a delicious and flavorful curry. To continue with the recipe, follow the steps below: 1. Heat a sufficient amount of oil in a frying pan over medium heat. 2. Once the oil is hot enough, gently add the paneer cubes into the pan and make sure they are well separated. 3. Fry until the paneer cubes turn golden brown on all sides. Be careful not to over-fry, as this may make the paneer chewy. 4. Once the paneer cubes are fried, remove them from the pan and place them on paper towels to drain excess oil. Now that you have prepared the paneer, the next steps to make the Kashmiri style paneer curry are: 5. In a separate pan, heat some oil and add whole spices such as cloves, green cardamom, and cinnamon. Cook for a minute to release the flavors of the spices. 6. Add finely chopped onions to the pan and fry until they turn golden brown. 7. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute. 8. At this point, add the main Kashmiri red chili powder, which offers the curry its distinct red color and is less spicy compared to other varieties. Mix well. 9.

Article: The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at the University of Virginia said Monday that it is moving forward with a possible lawsuit against Rolling Stone magazine in the wake of the now-retracted \\"Rape on Campus\\" article. \\"After 130 days of living under a cloud of suspicion as a result of reckless reporting by Rolling Stone magazine, today the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi announced plans to pursue all available legal action against the magazine,\\" the fraternity said in a statement. The fraternity hasn't made a formal decision yet on when to file a suit, a spokesman said. Rolling Stone declined to comment on the frat's statement. Its announcement came one day after the magazine published a damning external review of the editorial processes that resulted in the article's publication. The Rolling Stone article had alleged that a freshman student named Jackie had been gang raped during a Phi Kappa Psi frat party in September 2012. But soon after the article was printed last November, contradictions and discrepancies in Jackie's account emerged. The frat came out and denied that a party even took place on the night of the alleged attack. In December, the magazine apologized for the article and asked the Columbia University Journalism school to review what went wrong. Related: Can UVA fraternity actually sue Rolling Stone? One of Columbia's main conclusions was that the writer of the article, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, and her editors should have been much more forthcoming in her contacts with Phi Kappa Psi. If Rolling Stone \\"had given the fraternity a chance to review the allegations in detail, the factual discrepancies the fraternity would likely have reported might have led Erdely and her editors to try to verify Jackie's account more thoroughly,\\" the review said. According to the review, \\"none of the editors ever discussed with Erdely\\" whether frat officials had been given enough detail about the charges. She \\"never raised the subject with her editors.\\" In a statement on Monday, Stephen Scipione, the president of the Phi Kappa Psi chapter, said \\"this type of reporting serves as a sad example of a serious decline of journalistic standards.\\" \\"A lot of people threaten defamation and don't follow through with a lawsuit,\\" HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson said on CNN on Monday afternoon. \\"In this case, it's hard to argue that there were not tangible, recognizable reputational injuries.

Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s.

Scroll down until you find the link to the kernel version number you want to install, then click it to open its page. As of August 2018, the newest kernel is version 4.18. You can find it at the very bottom of the page under the v4.18 link. Usually the top list of kernel (.deb) files will work for your computer, but if you see a heading that contains files which seem better suited to your computer than the top heading, you may want to use its files instead. Each heading on the page should say \\"Build for [architecture] succeeded\\" where \\"architecture\\" refers to your computer's system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). Click each kernel file's link to do so . You'll need the \\"headers\\" file marked for all versions, the \\"image\\" file with \\"generic\\" in its name (avoid the \\"low latency\\" versions of these files), and the \\"modules\\" file with \\"generic\\" in its name. For example, to download the necessary files for kernel 4.18, you would click the following links: linux-headers-4.18.0-041800_4.18.0-041800.201808122131_all.deb linux-image-unsigned-4.18.0-041800-generic_4.18.0-041800.201808122131_amd64.deb linux-modules-4.18.0-041800-generic_4.18.0-041800.201808122131_amd64.deb Click the black Terminal icon on the left side of the screen. This will open the Terminal window. You can also press Ctrl+Alt+T to open Terminal. Type in cd Downloads and press ↵ Enter. If your default \\"Downloads\\" location for your web browser differs from the \\"Downloads\\" folder, replace \\"Downloads\\" with the path to the folder into which your kernel files downloaded. If you have any .deb files not related to the kernel installation in this directory, either move them or delete them before proceeding. Type in sudo dpkg -i *.deb and press ↵ Enter. Type in the password you use to log into your computer, then press ↵ Enter. You won't see any characters or stars appear while typing. This may take a few minutes. Once you see the \\"Downloads\\" directory tag reappear next to your name at the bottom of the window, you can proceed.

Widows, who were often allowed much control over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs.

A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower. - Tertiary education, also referred to as third stage, third level, and post-secondary education, is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education. The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as institutions that teach specific capacities of higher learning such as colleges, technical training institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories, centers of excellence, and distance learning centers. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as \\"further education\\" in the United Kingdom, or \\"continuing education\\" in the United States. - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving. - Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training. In some countries, only primary or basic education is compulsory, but secondary education is included in compulsory education in most countries. In post-Soviet countries it is also known as general education or general middle education. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college. - National Higher Education Fund Corporation ( Malay : Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional ) , abbreviated PTPTN is an authority responsible for giving study loans to students pursuing tertiary education in Malaysia .

Russian forces are monitoring the ceasefire along a key access road in northern Syria that leads to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, reports say. Some 250,000 civilians are trapped there. UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said if the truce held, aid deliveries \\"should be taking place very, very soon\\". He said the UN was waiting for the Syrian government to authorise deliveries and he hoped the people of Syria could look forward to \\"no bombs and more trucks\\". Since the truce came into effect at sunset on Monday, accusations have been made against both rebels and government forces for sporadically violating it. But there have been no reports of civilian deaths so far. The Russian military claims US-backed groups have violated the ceasefire more than 20 times. including killing two government troops on the Castello road, which leads to rebel-held Aleppo. The Russian foreign ministry called on the US \\"to deal with their clients\\". Russia has deployed reconnaissance equipment in Aleppo to detect and suppress ceasefire violations. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said pro-government forces had shelled two villages near Aleppo and an area near Damascus. It earlier said it had seen reports of aerial bombardment of some villages in Hama province. The Syrian government says it will not allow aid, particularly \\"from the Turkish regime\\", to be delivered to Aleppo without prior co-ordination with it and the UN, state media report. The UN says its trucks will not move until peace is assured. \\"We need to enter an environment where we are not in mortal danger,\\" Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA) said. The head of rebel-held Aleppo's city council told Reuters news agency that residents there were in desperate need of fuel, flour, wheat, baby milk and medicines. US Secretary of State John Kerry called on Friday for the Castello road to be demilitarised and said the US would work with Russia to free the route for aid convoys to reach Aleppo. The Syrian army has said the truce will be applied throughout Syria for seven days, but that it reserves the right to respond decisively to any violation by armed groups. A number of rebel factions have given a guarded welcome to the deal but expressed reservations about its implementation. A statement from 21 opposition factions including the Free Syrian Army said they were \\"fully aware of the trap being set to make us sink in a quagmire of concessions or lead us to infighting that divides our ranks and disunites us\\". They said they opposed the targeting of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (known until recently as the Nusra Front) which recently split from al-Qaeda \\"as this would weaken the military power of the revolution and strengthen the Assad regime and its allies\\". If the truce holds for seven days, a key part of the deal is that the US and Russia will carry out co-ordinated air strikes on militant groups - including so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. The deal, described by Mr Kerry as the \\"last chance to save a united Syria\\", was struck on Friday in Geneva after months of talks between Russia and the US. It requires both sides to allow unhindered access for humanitarian aid. The number of deaths recorded since the beginning of the conflict in March 2011 has now risen past 300,000, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. However, it said it estimated the full death toll to be about 430,000. More than 4.8 million have fled abroad, and an estimated 6.5 million others have been displaced within the country, the UN says. Jihadist groups like so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham face the joint might of the Russian and US air forces Moderate rebels and civilians in the areas they hold will no longer face the threat of indiscriminate air strikes such as barrel-bombing although the Syrian air force will not be grounded completely; aid deliveries will be allowed to areas currently under siege President Assad will be in a stronger position as the US and Russia engage two of his most effective military opponents while moderate rebels observe the truce with his forces February 2012: Syrian government \\"categorically rejects\\" an Arab League plan calling for a joint Arab-UN peacekeeping mission June 2012/January 2014/January 2016: Three failed UN-sponsored peace conferences in Geneva September 2013: Kerry and Lavrov negotiate a deal to strip the Syrian government of its chemical weapons in return for the US backing away from air strikes.

News. But that didn't stop Tila Tequila from trying to make the story about her. \\"I don't want to talk about the funeral,\\" Tequila tells us. \\"I wasn't allowed to go and I am so upset. I can't sleep and I am on suicide watch.\\" While Tequila may be the only one on suicide watch, she wasn't the only one not invited to the service, which is shaping up to be a private affair possibly taking place tomorrow. Several of the heiress's Hollywood pals, including Paris Hilton and former gal-pal Courtenay Semel, didn't make the guest list. Tequila, nominally Johnson's fiancée, also addressed the theory brought up on Johnson's 911 call that the socialite may have taken her own life. \\"It was an accident, for sure,\\" Tequila said. \\"She was so happy and wasn't ready to die.\\" Although autopsy results are still weeks away, Tequila believes Johnson's death last Monday was related to diabetes. \\"She gave me a book and told me what to do if something like that happened to her in the middle of the night,\\" Tequila said. \\"She knew if she wasn't treated then she could die.\\" Tequila also insisted, \\"Casey would want me to take care of [Johnson's daughter] Ava.\\" And she is still stewing about the visit paid by Nicky Hilton and Bijou Phillips earlier this week to collect Johnson's two dogs, a poodle named Zoe and a Yorkie named Elvis, along with various belongings. \\"They all lied to me,\\" Tequila said. \\"I just want the dogs back and make sure they are OK…I want it all back.\\" At the time, Tequila said she feared Hilton and Phillips were going to put the dogs to sleep. However, sources tell E! News that the dogs have been seen by a veterinarian and are in good shape. On Tuesday, expect Tequila to sound off some more when she appears on Larry King Live. \\"There is a lot of stuff I want to say,\\" Tequila said. \\"I don't want to bash anyone.\\" We'll see. _______ Take a look back at Casey Johnson's life in our gallery. ||||| After tweeting that she hadn't slept for four days straight following the death of fiancée Casey Johnson, the internet's favorite oversexed pocket-celebrity, Tila Tequila, went AWOL for two days, only to return by announcing \\"I HAVE NO FRIENDS!\\" Mulholland Drive on Meth appears to be approaching the Lord of the Flies-like dénouement where everyone forms a circle around the most-reviled character and destroys her completely.* (Or allows her to self-destruct, depending on whether or not there is a difference.) ** Tila disappeared from Twitter for two days following a much-discussed trip to the doctor, prompting some (okay, just me) to wonder whether a medical professional had tossed her into rehab or some other institution. But then, the anti-heroine resurfaced Sunday with 68 tweets and new blog posts. The tweets told the sad story of why Tila is incapable of staying off Twitter in her time of grief: Then, our tragic figure took to her official blog on Joe Francis-sponsored soft-core porn purveyor Tila's Hot Spot Dating and penned a missive entitled \\"TILA TEQUILA'S COMPELLING & SAD LIFE STORY!\\" Like Tila's Twitter, her blog is illegible and kind of frightening to experience firsthand, so here is an abbreviated guide and translation: Tila: Well last night I was on Twitter and I was just tweeting about random things and somehow one Tweet into the next it lead me into writing a mini auto-biography through 7 hours of Tweeting!!!!!!! [...] Everyone who read it was moved to tears and today a lot of people kept asking me where they could find that story. Translation: My compulsive oversharing has reached the tipping point where I am compelled to get off Twitter and get on my blog. My supernatural sense of self-importance has yet to diminish. Tila: Imma Ninja! Im serious! That's why they sent me away to Juvenile Boarding school...cuz Some DUDE tried 2 fight me & I beat him up. I got sent 6 months to juvie. But once I got sent to Juvie it was scary. Everyone was segregated & I had 2 find a new \\"gang\\" 2 chill wit 2 back me up in there & ...And so I rolled with the Mexicans.

I went from gang-banger, juvenile criminal 2 changing my life around & now living the dream in HOLLYWOOD! If I can do it SO CAN U! Translation: This lady had a rough life. That she clawed her way into Hollywood and onto MTV is actually pretty impressive, and accounts for my weird and deeply irrational soft spot for Tila, even as she proves time and again that she deserves very little sympathy. I guess she'll make for a fascinating profile subject some day (in that \\"fascination with the abomination\\" way) but not until she takes it down a notch or twenty-seven. Tila: Now u guys kinda know why I try so hard 2 help others. Translation: I have no sense whatsoever of my public image. She goes on to tell terrifying stories about an ad hoc abortion, gangland murders, and other \\"fucked up\\" scenes from her teen years, some of which are more believable than others—one of which involves a corpse mummified in duct tape—and all of which she plans to include in a new memoir. Tila had another cause to celebrate at the end of her two-day Twitter hiatus: Larry King booked her for Tuesday. But then her arch nemeses, Casey Johnson's loved ones, protested and Larry seems to have de-booked her, opting for interviews on the White House gatecrashers instead. Tila says it's a conspiracy: * This is horrifying in many ways, not least of which being that there is apparently nobody to respond to Tila's cry for help, which reminds me of a certain other recent Hollywood flameout. Over Christmas, Tila says she made amends with her estranged sister, and there's that brother she's a surrogate for. What happened to them? ** Is it possible that Tila is perfectly sane, and this is just how her mind works, and there is no cause for alarm? Or is something very bad about to happen? At what point does rubbernecking veer into some sort of ethical obligation? ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Casey Johnson, the heiress to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, was not laid to rest today at the family's burial plot in New Jersey, contrary to widespread reports.

The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me.

At the age of six months she was acquired, along with her sister, by John Ashley, a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders. She became known as \\"Mumbet\\" or \\"Mum Bett.\\" For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued for her freedom. While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great-grandchildren was W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the founder of the NAACP, and an important writer and spokesperson for African American civil rights. Mumbet's tombstone still stands in the Massachusetts cemetery where she was buried. It reads, in part: \\"She was born a slave and remained a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years.

Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season to the Steelers, the Vikings flew to Lambeau Field for the highly anticipated Week 8 divisional rematch with the Green Bay Packers, as quarterback Brett Favre made his return to his former team. In the first quarter, the Packers scored the game's first points as kicker Mason Crosby made a 37-yard field goal following a miscue by Vikings center John Sullivan (Favre audibled for another play but Sullivan snapped the ball before Favre completed his audible). Minnesota responded with a 1-yard touchdown from running back Adrian Peterson. In the second quarter, the Vikings added onto their lead as Favre completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell (another former Packer) nailing a 41-yard field goal. Minnesota picked up where they left off in the third quarter as Favre hooked up with rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 51-yard touchdown pass, yet Green Bay started to rally as Crosby booted a 26-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Aaron Rodgers finding tight end Spencer Havner on a 16-yard and a 5-yard touchdown pass. The Vikings answered in the fourth quarter with Favre connecting with tight end/fullback Jeff Dugan on a 2-yard touchdown pass. The Packers tried to come back as Rodgers completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings (with a failed 2-point conversion), but Minnesota pulled away with Favre finding wide receiver Bernard Berrian on a 16-yard touchdown pass. With their first season-sweep of the Packers in four years, the Vikings went into their bye week at 7-1, and took a commanding two and a half game lead in the NFC North over the second-place Packers.

When you smoke cigarettes, they contain harmful chemicals and toxins, including carbon monoxide, which compete with oxygen for binding sites on hemoglobin in red blood cells. This reduces the amount of oxygen that is available to be transported around the body. If a person smokes fewer cigarettes, the level of carbon monoxide and other harmful chemicals in their bloodstream would be reduced. This would allow for more oxygen to bind to hemoglobin, thus increasing the amount of oxygen being delivered to the body's cells. As a result, the body's organs and tissues would function more efficiently and effectively, leading to improved overall health and well-being. In conclusion, smoking less would have a positive effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the body, as it would lead to a decrease in harmful chemicals that compete with oxygen for binding sites on hemoglobin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I normally get my nails done by my manicurist on Fort Apache. However, this was right next to my work and I wanted to get it over with and try something new. **BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER** I left this place feeling disappointed and grossed out. 1)They reuse their nail filers and buffers. 2) The guy did a really uneven coat (some areas had the color and the other areas you saw my nail) so I told him I didn't like it. He removed it with the mechanical buffer thing. I didn't realize it until I got home and felt a stinging when I was cutting onions but he ended up buffing off my skin too! It wasn't just one finger too! 3) A client came in and was waiting for my manicurist. While I was picking a new color (he blamed it on the polish for the uneven job) I hear him telling the client that he was behind because I didn't like what he did. Which made me feel rushed and annoyed. 4) After I picked my color, he rushed through my gel manicure, put my hand under the UV light and rolled his chair over to the client that was waiting. He took off her gel manicure then came back to me to finish off my manicure. 5) He used his fingernail to remove the polish at the edge of the nail by my skin - f'ing gross 6) I watched him when he went to the other client and he used the same supplies he used on me on her. He did not use any new or sanitized items. And that was only my manicure experience ... Lesson of the day: Never cheat on your nail lady.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What aside from the sharpness of vision can aid in hunting prey?\\" Context: \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Aside from the sharpness of vision, other factors that can aid in hunting prey include the ability to detect ultraviolet light, the use of the nictitating membrane for eye lubrication and maintaining clear vision, wide visual fields or binocular vision for depth estimation, and adaptations in the avian ear for improved hearing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First of all I don't understand how it can be called a \\"15 gallon\\" humidifier when it really only holds 4 gallons - can anyone explain this? Also, we have also had problems with knowing when to refill it until the humidifier starts making a funny noise (and this surely isn't good on the machine to constantly let it run out of water). Also, we have had a funny substance running out of the machine almost from the beginning of use, and today while wiping up the \\"junk\\" I noticed that it is green now. ???? Anyway - the reason I rated it a '2' is because it is nice looking and does run 'fairly' quietly when it is full of water. Overall, our family has been very disappointed in this humidifier. Answer: The answer is:","completion":"There is a negative tone to this product review. The reviewer has shared several issues they have faced with the product, starting with the confusion regarding the capacity of the humidifier. They mention calling it a \\"15-gallon\\" humidifier when it only holds 4 gallons, which indicates that they feel misled by the labeling or description of the product. Another problem the reviewer has faced is not knowing when to refill the humidifier, which leads to it running out of water and making a strange noise. This not only causes them inconvenience but also raises concerns over the lifespan of the machine if it is being continuously operated without water. The reviewer also brings up a hygiene concern, with the humidifier emitting a strange, green substance from the beginning of its usage. This is concerning for them, as it likely questions the safety and cleanliness of the product. The reviewer does mention two positive aspects of the product, which are its nice appearance and the relatively quiet operation when full of water. However, these positives are outweighed by the multiple negative points discussed. In conclusion, the overall tone of the review is negative, as the reviewer expresses disappointment with the product and outlines several problems they encountered while using it. The rating of '2' also highlights their dissatisfaction with the humidifier's performance."},{"prompt":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: James Hart (Timothy Bottoms) starts his first year at Harvard Law School in a very bad way.

A paleontologist named Zack takes his nephew Ricky and niece Jade on a fossil hunt. While alone, Ricky is met by a talking raven, who turns into an Alexornis named Alex. He tells him of a story set in the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago. Patchi is the smallest in a litter of Pachyrhinosaurus hatchlings, and is often bullied by his older brother Scowler. Their father Bulldust is the leader of the Pachyrhinosaurus herd. Alex, who is Patchi's mentor, tries to help Patchi impress a female Pachyrhinosaurus named Juniper, but her herd migrates south without him. Bulldust moves his herd south as well, but when they try to pass through a forest, they are forced to flee when a storm strikes and a fire erupts. Taking advantage of the chaos, a pack of Gorgosaurus attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family while their leader Gorgon fights and kills Bulldust. Afterwards, Patchi's herd (now led by Bulldust's rival Major) combines with Juniper's as they continue their migration. There, Gorgon's pack attacks them again. In the ensuing chaos, Patchi, Scowler, and Juniper fall into a river and are swept downstream to the ocean, with Alex following them from above. At a beach, Scowler follows a herd of Edmontosaurus to find food, callously leaving Patchi and Juniper behind. The two make their way through a forest and eventually are able to find their herd and Scowler.","completion":"Bulldust is the father of Patchi and Scowler, who are Pachyrhinosaurus hatchlings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Who Framed Roger Rabbit Movie plot: In 1947, \\"toons\\" act out theatrical cartoon shorts as with live-action films; they regularly interact with real people and animals and reside in Toontown, an animated portion of Los Angeles. Private detective Eddie Valiant and his brother, Teddy, once worked closely with the toons on several famous cases, but after Teddy was killed by a toon, Eddie lapsed into alcoholism and vowed never to work for toons again. One day, R.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoon Studios, is concerned about the recent poor acting performances of one of his biggest stars, Roger Rabbit. Maroon hires Valiant to investigate rumors about Roger's voluptuous toon wife Jessica being romantically involved with businessman and gadgets inventor, Marvin Acme, owner of both Acme Corporation and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at the underground Ink &amp; Paint Club, Valiant secretly takes photographs of her and Acme playing patty-cake in her dressing room, which he shows to Roger. Maroon suggests to Roger that he should leave Jessica, but a drunken Roger refuses and flees. The next morning, Acme is discovered dead at his factory with a safe dropped on his head, and evidence points to Roger being responsible. While investigating, Valiant meets Judge Doom, Toontown's Superior Court judge, who has created a substance capable of killing a toon: a toxic chemical known as \\"The Dip\\". Valiant runs into Roger's toon co-star, Baby Herman, who believes Roger is innocent and that Acme's missing will, which will give the toons ownership of Toontown, may be the key to his murder. He then finds Roger hiding in his office, who begs him to help exonerate him. Valiant reluctantly hides Roger in a local bar where his ex-girlfriend, Dolores, works. Later, Jessica approaches Valiant and says that Maroon had forced her to pose for the photographs so that he could blackmail Acme.

Write the above sentence using proper case.","completion":"In our waste reduction efforts, we target several levels: production, product, and consumer. At our bakeries in Belgium, for example, we have introduced regular analyses to ensure our flour has the right baking properties. Waste reduction is a crucial element for sustainable living and reducing our environmental footprint. By focusing on production, product, and consumer levels, a comprehensive approach to waste management can be implemented, with benefits spanning across the entire supply chain. At the production level, waste reduction can be achieved through optimizing manufacturing operations, focusing on resource efficiency, and reducing the amount of waste generated during the manufacturing process. This may include using advanced technology to monitor production and minimize resource consumption, eliminating unnecessary processes, and ensuring that equipment runs at optimal efficiency. Implementing lean manufacturing principles and embracing a circular economy approach can also contribute to waste reduction. In terms of the product, businesses can actively work towards reducing waste by designing their products to have a longer lifespan, be more easily repairable, and use fewer materials, resulting in a lower overall environmental impact. By choosing environmentally friendly materials, using less packaging, and implementing eco-design principles, companies can develop products that contribute to waste reduction efforts and promote a more sustainable lifestyle for consumers. Lastly, at the consumer level, waste reduction can be promoted through awareness campaigns, education, and incentives to encourage consumers to make more sustainable choices. Consumers can be educated on proper recycling practices, reducing food waste, embracing minimalism, and making conscious efforts to purchase and use products that have less environmental impact. By offering incentives and fostering a culture of sustainability, businesses can help consumers make choices that contribute to the overall goal of waste reduction. One excellent example of waste reduction efforts at a local level is demonstrated by bakeries in Belgium. By conducting regular analyses of their flour, these bakeries ensure that it has the appropriate baking properties, thus minimizing any potential waste that could be generated due to unfavorable baking results. This practice not only contributes to waste reduction but also maintains a high level of quality and consistency in the products they offer. In conclusion, waste reduction efforts that focus on production, product, and consumer levels can significantly contribute to a more sustainable future. By implementing best practices at every stage, businesses can play an essential role in reducing waste, promoting environmental awareness, and ensuring that consumers have access to eco-friendly products and information needed to make environmentally conscious choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: The courtesans for the following movie plot: In four elegant brothels, called \\"Flower Houses\\", in fin-de-siÃ¨cle 19th-century Shanghai (Qing dynasty), several affairs are described. Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea occur more than once, and dishes of food are served and hot towels prepared in several scenes. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang Enclave (èè³é) brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang Enclave (å¬é½é) brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren Enclave (å°ä»é) brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing Enclave (æ±åèé) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as \\"Aunties\\". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as \\"flower girls\\", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (possible through a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social status. The silent Master Wang leaves the courtesan Crimson in favor of Jasmine, with whom he fell madly in love in only 10 days, after (allegedly) 2Â½ years with Crimson. He offers to settle Crimson's debts. Wang sees himself with multiple ties and between hardening fronts. The dependencies turn out to be reciprocal.

Where can a finger be warm? - glove - ring - cake batter to taste add weight to scale - nose - hand The best answer is","completion":"While all the mentioned options hold some truth, the most accurate and appropriate answer among them is using a glove to keep a finger warm. Gloves are specifically designed to provide warmth, insulation, and protection to fingers and hands during cold weather or when handling cold objects. Moreover, gloves come in various materials such as wool, leather, and synthetics, which offer varying degrees of warmth, comfort, and versatility. Now, let us discuss the other options and ascertain why gloves are superior for warmth. 1. Ring: Although a ring adorns fingers and may occupy a small surface area of the finger, it does not help in maintaining the warmth of the entire finger. A ring can be made from different materials, such as gold, silver, or platinum, which may have conductive properties, but they do not offer substantial insulation. Therefore, a ring cannot compete with gloves when it comes to providing warmth. 2. Cake batter: Certainly, cake batter can be warm due to the ingredients, such as eggs and milk, which are often incorporated at room temperature. When dipping a finger into cake batter, it may feel warm momentarily, but this is not a suitable solution for keeping fingers comfortable, especially in cold conditions. Additionally, the use of cake batter is limited to occasions when baking, and its warming property is not persistent. 3. Weight on a scale: This option is slightly unclear in terms of keeping a finger warm. Perhaps by adding a weight to a scale and holding the finger firmly on the weighing platform could give temporary warmth through the contact. However, using a weight on a scale is not a practical way to maintain warmth and protect fingers from the cold. 4. Nose: The human body emanates heat, and therefore, touching one's nose with a finger can certainly feel warm. Nonetheless, placing a finger on or in the nose continuously in order to keep it warm is impractical and can be considered unhygienic. 5. Hand: As mentioned earlier, the human body produces heat, so clasping fingers within the palm of the same or another person's hand can give a certain degree of warmth to the finger. However, this method lacks the insulation and long-lasting warmth that gloves provide. Furthermore, holding fingers in hand may not be feasible when one needs to use their hands for other tasks. In conclusion, while all the above-listed options involve some contact with warmth, gloves are undeniably the most effective and practical choice for keeping fingers warm. Gloves offer insulation, protection, and retain heat for an extended period, making them an ideal solution in comparison to options such as rings, cake batter, weights on scales, noses, or hands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Contractor behind HealthCare.gov to testify extra testing could not have saved site A top executive with CGI Federal, one of the contractors paid millions to create the ObamaCare website, says “no amount of testing” could have prevented the site’s problem-plagued start. Senior Vice President Cheryl Campbell’s remarks are part of prepared testimony she will give before a Republican-led House hearing Thursday on the insurance-marketplace site. They also appear to challenge new claims by the administration that a lack of adequate testing was part of the problem. The House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing is the first since the site’s disastrous Oct. 1 launch -- marked by crashes, slow response times and its inability to let customers make purchases. In the prepared testimony, Campbell argues that with a system “this complex with so many concurrent users, it is not unusual to discover problems that need to be addressed once the software goes into a live production environment.” “No amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature,” she adds, according to the prepared testimony. Campbell said issues with HealthCare.gov have continued to improve over the past two weeks, but additional challenges are occurring as more users get past the registration screen and buy insurance -- including “data assurance issues.” She said such problems can be fixed through “tuning, optimization and application improvements.” The testimony comes as the Obama administration offered new details and explanations on Wednesday. The administration said the system didn't get enough testing, especially at a high user volume. It blamed a compressed time frame for meeting the Oct. 1 deadline to open the insurance markets. Basic \\"alpha and user testing\\" are now completed, but that's supposed to happen before a launch, not after. The Health and Human Services explanation identified some bugs that have gotten little outside attention. For example, technical problems have surfaced that are making it hard for people to complete the application and plan-shopping functions. That's a big concern because those stages are further along in the signup process than the initial registration, where many consumers have been getting tripped up. The problems are being analyzed and fixes are planned, the department said. The explanation, posted online in a department blog and accompanying graphic, identified other broad areas of problems and outlined fixes underway but in most cases incomplete: -- Unexpectedly high consumer interest that overwhelmed the system in its initial days. Equipment has been added to handle the load and system design has been improved. More fixes are in progress. -- Lack of a way for consumers to browse their health plan options without first having to set up a user account. A partial fix is in place. -- Incorrect or duplicate information in enrollments is being delivered to insurance companies. Some software fixes that should help address the issue have been completed, others are underway. -- Difficulties for consumers trying to create user accounts, including drop-down menus that didn't work. Design changes and software fixes should address the situation. On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will line up contractors, including CGI Federal, the lead developer of the website, and QSSI, which designed a back-room operation known as the federal data services hub.

After the performance, Novak is mobbed by well-wishers, and a student reporter questions him about his favorite composers. Novak lists some famous ones, then adds, \\"And, of course, Hollenius.\\" Novak returns to his dressing room, Christine enters and their eyes meet in his mirror. The couple embraces while Christine cries, \\"I thought you were dead. I saw them kill you.\\" Karel and Christine return to her apartment. Karel becomes suspicious of the rare artwork on display and the fur coat hanging in the closet. Christine has told Karel that she is living a precarious existence as a pianist but this conflicts with the evidence in the apartment. They marry, but the composer Alexander Hollenius (Claude Rains) makes a dramatic entrance at their wedding reception. It is evident he is jealous, and the stress leads him to break a wine glass without deliberate intent. Hollenius soon gives Novak a manuscript score of his new cello concerto, which Novak agrees to perform at its premiere. It becomes apparent to Christine that a cellist in the orchestra, Bertram Gribble (John Abbott), is being tutored in the solo part by Hollenius. Suspecting the sabotage of her husband's career, she unsuccessfully attempts to bribe Gribble into not co-operating. A friction develops between Novak and Hollenius, and the composer angrily breaks off a dress rehearsal on the grounds of Novak's temperamental behavior. On the evening of the premiere, Christine visits Hollenius, who threatens to tell Novak of their love affair. Distraught, Christine shoots him dead. Another conductor, Neilsen, takes the place of the absent Hollenius, and the performance is a great success. While well-wishers wait, Christine confesses everything to her husband, and they leave the concert hall...","completion":"Can't answer"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it When did researchers discover eating a lot of fruit can reduce the risk of an aortic aneurysm? - After conducting a 13-year study. - After developing diabetes. - After going on a low crab diet. - not enough information Answer:","completion":"After conducting a 13-year study."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Firm A does not require large initial costs, but firm B and firm C require large initial costs. Firm B managed to increase its market share, but firm C failed to increase its market share. But I can use this background: A firm with high fixed costs requires a large number of customers in order to have a meaningful return on investment. This is where economies of scale become important. Since each firm has large initial costs, as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost (what they initially invested) is divided among a larger number of customers. Therefore, in industries with large initial investment requirements, average total cost declines as output increases over a much larger range of output levels. What is an answer for this question: Which frim's average total cost would decline, firm B or firm C? Answer:","completion":"Firm B's average total cost would decline. This is because Firm B managed to increase its market share, allowing it to spread its high fixed costs over a larger number of customers.

Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.

Solve 0 = 233994*k - 234048*k + 3510 for k.","completion":"To solve the given equation, 0 = 233994*k - 234048*k + 3510, for k, we need to simplify and isolate the variable k. Let's follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms The equation has two terms containing the variable k: 233994*k and -234048*k. We start by combining these terms. 0 = (233994 - 234048) * k + 3510 Note that 233994 - 234048 = -54. Now, we can simplify the equation as: 0 = -54 * k + 3510 Step 2: Isolate the variable k We want the variable k by itself, so we will work on isolating it. To do that, we need to reverse the operations applied to k in order. Currently, k is being multiplied by -54 and then added to 3510. We can reverse this by first subtracting 3510 from both sides and then dividing by -54. Subtract 3510 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 3510 = -54 * k + 3510 - 3510 -3510 = -54 * k Now, divide both sides of the equation by -54: (-3510) / (-54) = (-54 * k) / (-54) 65 = k Step 3: Check the solution We can always verify our solution by substituting the value of k back into the original equation and verifying that both sides balance: 0 = 233994 * k - 234048 * k + 3510 0 = 233994 * 65 - 234048 * 65 + 3510 Now perform the calculations: 0 = 15209610 - 15209640 + 3510 0 = -30 + 3510 0 = 0 As both sides are equal, our solution is correct. Thus, the solution of the given equation, 0 = 233994*k - 234048*k + 3510, is k = 65."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize: The Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes galleon sank off Portugal's coast near the straits of Gibraltar in 1804 with more than 500,000 silver coins. Spain won a five-year legal dispute to claim ownership for the treasures found by a US firm. Only a small portion of the treasure, estimated to be worth 500m (Â£310m; 385m euros) has been displayed. A block of encrusted silver coins stuck together after centuries under water, two gold tobacco boxes and a bronze pulley were among some of the items shown. After it has been fully catalogued - a process that began when the treasure arrived from Florida in February - the silver treasure will be put on display in Spain's museum of underwater archaeology in Cartagena. So far, experts have counted 574,553 silver coins and 212 gold coins, as well as other items. The metals were mined and the coins minted in the Andes, from places that are now in Bolivia, Chile and Peru. Spanish officials say that they never intend to sell the treasure. \\"It's invaluable,\\" Elisa de Cabo, the culture ministry's deputy director of national heritage, said according to the Associated Press. \\"How would you put a price on the Mona Lisa?\\" Obtaining the ship's haul was the culmination of a long legal fight. Ms de Cabo said Spanish authorities are still trying to convince a US judge that the American company that found the wreck, Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration, should also pay Spain's legal costs. The company has said in statements that it had spent 2.6m salvaging, transporting, storing and conserving the treasure.","completion":"A long time ago, in 1804, a big ship called Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes sank in the ocean near Portugal with lots of silver and gold coins. After many years, people from the United States found the ship and the treasures. But the people in Spain said the treasures belonged to them. So, they went to court and, after five years, Spain won. Now, there are many coins and other things like gold boxes and bronze parts in the treasure. And guess what? They are worth so much money, around 500 million! But the people in Spain don't want to sell them. They think the treasure is so precious, just like the famous painting, the Mona Lisa. Soon, they will show the silver treasure in a special museum in Spain. But before that, they need to write down everything they have found.

Movie title: She's the One Movie plot: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\". One day, Mickey picks up Heather in his cab and goes up to her apartment to retrieve a television that belonged to him...

A better, detailed and long answer to the question would be: The South Bronx, a region located in the southeastern part of the Bronx borough in New York City, is geographically defined by its natural borders consisting of rivers and parks. The eastern edge of the South Bronx is formed by the Bronx River, a 23-mile long freshwater river that flows through the borough. This river originates in Westchester County and enters the Bronx near the New York Botanical Garden, which is located in the northern part of the Bronx. It then meanders through the South Bronx, passing parks, and residential neighborhoods before ultimately emptying into the East River. Historically, the Bronx River played a significant role in the industrial and urban development of the area. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the river was used for transportation and as a source of power, propelling the growth of the various manufacturing industries that flourished in the region. Unfortunately, the rapid urbanization and industrial activities led to pollution and degradation of the river, which consequently affected the surrounding neighborhoods. The South Bronx has faced numerous economic and social challenges, including high poverty rates and crime. However, recent revitalization efforts have been made to improve the conditions in the area. These initiatives include investments in affordable housing, new businesses, and infrastructure improvements. Additionally, projects like the Bronx River Greenway and the Bronx River Alliance have focused on restoring and protecting the river, transforming it into a recreational and natural asset for the community. So, in conclusion, the river that forms the eastern edge of the South Bronx is the Bronx River, which not only serves as a geographical marker for the area but also as a representation of the neighborhood's past and potential future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] I am facing a new situation today: Ryan explored two lakes; Big lake, and Arrow lake to the south. Arrow lake had a river flowing into it, while Big lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity. Many divers drowned in Arrow lake because of temperature shock. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which lake had less occurrences of divers drowning? The answer is:","completion":"Big Lake. Step 1: Understand the background information The background article explains that thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature, can occur in lakes when there are specific conditions. For example, in lakes where cold fresh water enters a warmer sea, the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, causing the temperature to rise as the diver descends. In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water, which can lead to convection currents. Step 2: Analyze the new situation In the new situation, Ryan explored two lakes: Big Lake and Arrow Lake. Arrow Lake had a river flowing into it, which is a condition that can cause a thermocline with a temperature increase as the diver descends. Big Lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity, which can lead to convection currents. Many divers have drowned in Arrow Lake due to temperature shock. Step 3: Apply background knowledge to the new situation From the background information, we know that a thermocline can cause sudden temperature changes in a lake. In Arrow Lake, the river flowing into it likely caused a thermocline, resulting in a temperature increase as divers descended. This temperature shock likely contributed to the frequent drowning incidents. On the other hand, Big Lake has underwater geothermal activity, which leads to convection currents. While there might be temperature differences between the surface and deeper parts of the lake, convection currents tend to distribute the temperature more evenly, reducing the likelihood of sudden temperature changes that could cause temperature shock for divers. Step 4: Answer the question Based on the information provided and our understanding of thermoclines, Big Lake is the lake with fewer occurrences of divers drowning because it has a lower likelihood of sharp temperature changes due to convection currents caused by geothermal activity. On the contrary, Arrow Lake has a thermocline caused by the river flowing into it, which resulted in temperature shock and drowning incidents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is some data: Bakewell pudding SERVING_TEMPERATURE \\"Warm (freshly baked) or cold\\"; Bakewell pudding SERVED \\"Warm or cold\\". Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"This data provides information about Bakewell Pudding, a popular English dessert. It is a sweet treat that originated in the town of Bakewell, in the heart of the beautiful Peak District in Derbyshire, England. This dessert is made with a unique combination of flaky pastry, a layer of jam, and a delicate filling made from ground almonds, sugar, butter, and eggs. Here, the attributes of the dessert, such as serving temperature and the ways it can be served, are highlighted. Let me elaborate further: 1. Serving Temperature: The data specifies that Bakewell Pudding can be enjoyed either at the temperature it is freshly baked, which is typically warm, or cold. The deliciousness of the dessert is not primarily dependent on the serving temperature, so individuals can prefer either option, and this versatility appeals to a wide range of taste preferences. Freshly baked, the pudding gives off a rich aroma of butter and almonds, and when served warm, it provides an indulgent and comforting experience. On the other hand, when served cold, the pudding has a firmer texture and allows the different elements, like the pastry and almond filling, to meld together harmoniously. 2. Ways to Serve: Bakewell Pudding can be served in different ways to suit tastes and occasions. According to the data, it can be presented either warm or cold, which gives consumers the flexibility to decide how they want to enjoy it. Here are some suggestions for serving Bakewell Pudding: A. Warm: - Fresh out of the oven: For those who love to indulge in freshly baked treats, Bakewell Pudding can be enjoyed straight from the oven. This allows for the warmth and aroma of the pastry to create a cozy, inviting experience. - With a scoop of ice cream: Pairing warm Bakewell Pudding with a scoop of ice cream creates a delightful contrast in temperatures and adds richness to the overall dessert. A popular choice for ice cream flavors would be vanilla, but you can also try other flavors, such as caramel or even berry-flavored ice creams to complement the jam layer. B. Cold: - As a standalone treat: Bakewell Pudding is delicious all on its own, even when enjoyed cold. The pastry, jam, and filling each offer distinct flavors and textures to create a satisfying and moreish dessert. - With a side of whipped cream or custard: To enhance the creamy texture and add a touch of indulgence, cold Bakewell Pudding can be served with a side of whipped cream or custard. This addition further highlights the depth of flavors in the pudding while providing a smooth and velvety consistency. In summary, the data informs us that Bakewell Pudding is a versatile dessert that can be enjoyed at different temperatures and served in various ways. Regardless of whether it is warm or cold, this classic English dessert remains a delightful and delicious experience for all to relish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Charlotte's father, Elbourne, hires D, a dhampir, to find her and rescue her, and alternatively, kill her humanely if she's been turned into a vampire. He offers D 500,000 as a down payment, and offers him 10mil if he carries out the job. D has Elbourne double the payment, and agrees to search for Charlotte. At the same time, Charlotte's older brother hires another group of vampire hunters, the notorious Marcus brothers, composed of the leader Borgoff, a hulking man named Nolt, a blade master named Kyle, a physically disabled psychic named Grove and a woman named Leila who hunts vampires because of a personal grudge rather than for monetary gain.

Here is an article: “Une Femme Mariée” has long been the missing link in Jean-luc Godard’s early filmography. Released late in 1964, rarely screened in this country, and hard to find on video, the French New Wave director’s eighth feature (in four years!) has represented an unseen gap between the playful “Bande a Part” (1964) and the future-is-now dystopia of “Alphaville” (1965). Its title anglicized as “A Married Woman,” the film is touring the nation’s art houses in a digitally restored print ahead of a May Blu-ray release, and it arrives at the Kendall Square Cinema looking like a seductive, inscrutable masterpiece. Why should you see it? Not only is “Woman” the most sensual entry in Godard’s first decade — maybe in his career — but it serves as a pivot-point between the genre games of his immediate past and the cultural critiques to come. And, like all of those movies, it’s hung up on women, their mercurial mystery, their shallowness and depths. Macha Méril plays Charlotte, the femme mariée of the title, a pretty, airheaded Parisienne zigzagging between a husband, Pierre (Philippe Leroy), and a lover, Robert (Bernard Noël). She’s an enigma to both and an insecure void to herself, and Godard films their various entanglements in and out of bed as a series of beautiful, isolated body parts. The cinematographer was Raoul Coutard, Godard’s right hand in the early days (Truffaut’s, too), and the restored black-and-white photography in “A Married Woman” is stunning in the way it captures the silvery opacity of a woman’s skin. The images are erotic yet empty, alluring and withholding; it’s a world of surfaces because that’s what Charlotte thinks matters. For the first time in a Godard movie, though, we feel the vapid consumer culture crowding in, as the heroine obsesses over women’s magazines and the proper bust size. Bra ads and heavy-breathing headlines increasingly dominate the screen; sex is on everyone’s minds and lips and album covers. Charlotte lives strictly in the present but there’s no place to hide there; the soundtrack is filled with her whispered uncertainties and Beethoven string quartets. Beauty in this movie is squeezed out of modern life until it fills the cracks between the characters’ feelings. Plenty of filmmakers after Godard have mimicked his abstract/intellectual approach to cinema, and they’ve generally failed — Terrence Malick is just the latest to crash on the rocks. To see “A Married Woman,” then, is to revisit an improvisational energy unlike any other, the way there have been millions of Dylan imitators but only one Dylan. What sounds like pretentiousness seemed in the young Godard’s hands the only possible way to make movies. At times, it still does. Aspects of this film look ahead to the work to come — the grand romantic disenchantment of 1965’s “Pierrot le Fou,” the pop Marxism of “Masculin Feminin” (1966), even the sociopolitical apocalypse of “Weekend” (1967). But “A Married Woman” exists in a valedictory half-light all its own. In the final shots, the lovers’ disconnected hands part once and for all, and it’s as though Godard were bidding farewell to love itself. Written and directed by Jean-luc Godard.

Given the following context: The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side.

Please answer the following question: When the seasons change from the summer to the fall , the amount of daylight will decrease, and when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun. Given these facts, how does the amount of daylight change in a location as the season there changes to fall among the following options: - uncontrolled - colors - reduce - increases - depends on the hemisphere - temperature - stays the same - decreases A:","completion":"As the seasons change from summer to fall, the amount of daylight in a location will generally decrease. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the Sun, which affects the distribution of sunlight across the planet's surface throughout the year. During summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun. This results in more direct sunlight and longer daylight hours for places in the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, the South Pole is tilted away from the Sun during this time, meaning less direct sunlight and shorter daylight hours for locations in the Southern Hemisphere. As the Earth continues its orbit and transitions from summer to fall, the axial tilt changes, and the angle of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface becomes less direct. This causes the amount of daylight to gradually decrease in a location as the season progresses. This is most noticeable around the time of the autumn equinox, which typically occurs around September 22nd in the Northern Hemisphere and March 20th in the Southern Hemisphere. On the equinox, day and night are approximately equal in length all around the planet. By the time the seasons fully transition from summer to fall, the amount of daylight in a location is significantly less than it was at the peak of summer. This is true for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, though the specific change in daylight hours will depend on the latitude of the location. Areas closer to the poles will experience more significant differences in daylight hours between seasons, while areas near the equator will see smaller fluctuations in the amount of daylight. In summary, as the seasons change from summer to fall, the amount of daylight in a location generally decreases due to the Earth's changing axial tilt and its orbit around the Sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group. In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy. Although it is banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups.","completion":"Based on the context provided, the full name of the person who changes their song last minute in the talent contest is Edna Buxton. Born as an heiress to a steel fortune, Edna enters the talent contest and ultimately follows her passion for music, changing not only her song but also her wardrobe for the competition. Despite her mother's disapproval, this decision propels Edna into a career as a successful singer and songwriter. As her career takes off, Edna begins working with Joel Milner, who rebrands her under a new stage name, Denise Waverly, and creates a blue-collar persona for her. This change proves to be crucial, as it opens up doors for Denise in the music industry, allowing her to create a hit song for the Stylettes and eventually become a songwriter at the Brill Building in New York City. In addition to collaborating with multiple artists, Edna Buxton, now known as Denise Waverly, fosters a fruitful partnership with the talented but arrogant Howard Caszatt, culminating in the creation of a song titled \\"Unwanted Number\\". Even though this song deals with a controversial topic—in this case, a young girl's unwanted pregnancy—it garners attention from influential disc jockey John Murray, who applauds Denise for her creativity and originality, subsequently sparking the craze for girl groups in the music scene during that time period. Thus, Edna Buxton, who later adopts the stage name Denise Waverly, is the individual who changes her song at the last moment in the talent contest, setting her on a trajectory for success as an influential singer, songwriter, and catalyst for the girl group phenomenon in the mid-1960s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer is:","completion":"Alex behaved this way primarily due to his upbringing and lack of discipline. His parents spoiled him, making him accustomed to getting what he wanted without facing any consequences. As a result, he may have developed a sense of entitlement and a belief that his desires should always be accommodated. This could have led Alex to exhibit domineering behavior in preschool. In preschool, where children interact with peers, teachers, and aides, Alex likely attempted to replicate the power dynamics he experienced at home. He tried to govern every person because he was used to having control and receiving preferential treatment. The unfamiliar environment and expectations of the preschool may have prompted him to assert his dominance more forcefully, in an attempt to recreate the control he had with his parents. Furthermore, his lack of discipline may have hindered his ability to understand and adhere to social norms and boundaries. Without proper guidance from his parents or prior experience in adhering to rules, Alex might not have been aware of the appropriate ways to interact with others, leading to his attempts to govern his classmates, aides, and teachers.

Cameron's expression of care for their friendship with Casey could indicate that they value personal connections and emotional bonds, which might contribute to their happiness. Being open about their feelings and thoughts may also suggest that Cameron is a communicative and emotionally expressive person. Such qualities could make them appear happy or content, especially when interacting with people they care about. However, it's essential to consider other aspects of Cameron's personality, emotions, and characteristics to provide a more accurate and comprehensive description. People can exhibit a range of emotions and traits, with happiness being just one among many. To give a well-rounded description of Cameron, it would be helpful to gather more information about their interests, values, habits, and experiences in various life situations.

Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Please answer this question : Which fruits' moisture would not be absorbed from within, basket A fruits or basket B fruits? Answer:","completion":"The moisture would not be absorbed from within the basket B fruits, as Greg only used the basket A fruits to make candied fruits. The basket B fruits were just kept on the kitchen top and were not placed in heated sugar syrup for the candying process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Sometime after 4 p.m. on December 6, 1989, Marc Lépine arrived at the building housing the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a hunting knife. Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.\\" He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost. Before leaving the room, he wrote the word shit twice on a student project.Lépine continued into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where...

High, cold ice clouds such as Cirrus or Cumulonimbus show up bright white, lower warmer clouds such as Stratus or Stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3–11.5 µm) and the near-infrared channel (1.58–1.64 µm), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a fog satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.

Information: - An ascus (plural asci; from Greek \\"skós\\" 'skin bag') is the sexual spore-bearing cell produced in ascomycete fungi. Asci usually contain eight ascospores, produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division. However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. \\"Monosporascus cannonballus\\"), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. \\"Tympanis\\") with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some \\"Cordyceps\\", also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term ocular chamber, or oculus, refers to the epiplasm (the portion of cytoplasm not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the \\"bourrelet\\" (the thickened tissue near the top of the ascus). - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - In formal nomenclature. When formally naming a taxon, uncertainty about its taxonomic classification can be problematic. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, stipulates that \\"species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations\\", but ranks higher than the genus may be assigned \\"incertae sedis\\". - Dikarya is a subkingdom of Fungi that includes the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, both of which in general produce dikaryons, may be filamentous or unicellular, but are always without flagella. The Dikarya are most of the so-called \\"higher fungi\\", but also include many anamorphic species that would have been classified as molds in historical literature. Phylogenetically the two phyla regularly group together. In a 1998 publication, Thomas Cavalier-Smith referred to this group as the Neomycota. - Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \\"ascus\\" (from Greek: (\\"askos\\"), meaning \\"sac\\" or \\"wineskin\\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi. - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Coryneliella is a genus of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum . The relationship of this taxon to other taxa within the class is unknown ( incertae sedis ) , and it has not yet been placed with certainty into any class , order , or family . This is a monotypic genus , containing the single species Coryneliella consimilis . - An ascospore is a spore contained in an ascus or that was produced inside an ascus. This kind of spore is specific to fungi classified as ascomycetes (Ascomycota). Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Povenmire was born in San Diego, California on September 18, 1963, and grew up in the city of Mobile, Alabama. A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; by the time he was ten, his work was displayed in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that \\"every drawing he [Jones] did was beautiful to look at and had so much energy in it\\". Povenmire later became a director on Family Guy, starting with the season two episode, \\"Road to Rhode Island\\". Creator Seth MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom. Povenmire recalled that MacFarlane would tell him \\"We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags. Do whatever you want. I trust you.\\" Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him \\"have [...] fun.\\" Povenmire brought realism and material from his own experiences to the visual direction of Family Guy. For \\"One if By Clam, Two if By Sea\\" (August 1, 2001), several characters demonstrate Fosse-like moves in prison. To correctly depict the moves, Povenmire asked color artist Cynthia MacIntosh, who had been a professional dancer, to strike poses so he could properly illustrate the sequence. In the episode \\"To Love and Die in Dixie\\" (November 15, 2001), Povenmire drew on his childhood in the Deep South to create and sequence a background scene in which the redneck character nonchalantly kicks a corpse into the nearby river. \\"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\\" (January 17, 2002), a Family Guy episode which Povenmire directed, won the Emmy Award for Best Song. Creator MacFarlane, the recipient of the award, noted that Povenmire deserved to have received the award for the contribution the visuals made to the episode's win. Povenmire jokingly responded \\"That's a nice sentiment and all, but did he offer to give me his? No! And it's not like he doesn't already have two of his own just sitting in his house!\\" Povenmire was nominated for an Annie Award for Directing in an Animated Television Production for the episode \\"PTV\\" (November 6, 2005) but lost out to a fellow Family Guy director Peter Shin, who had directed the episode \\"North by North Quahog\\". Povenmire and several others were also nominated for their work on \\"PTV\\" in the Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) category at the Primetime Emmy Awards. Povenmire also received the same nomination for \\"Road to Rhode Island.\\" During Family Guy's brief cancellation, Povenmire was offered a job as storyboard director of the series SpongeBob SquarePants. He wrote various musical numbers for the series, including \\"The Campfire Song Song\\" in \\"The Camping Episode\\" (April 3, 2004).

Davey Gillen, a new IRA prisoner, arrives; he is categorised as a \\"non-conforming prisoner\\" for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked with only a blanket. His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards are seen snickering as they are handed to the prisoners who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot police are seen coming into the prison on a truck. They line up and beat their batons against their shields and scream to scare the prisoners, who are hauled from their cells, then forced to run the gauntlet between the lines of riot police where they are beaten with the batons by at least 10 men at one time.

A:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation of having more water available will directly affect the process of freezing ice cubes. If more water is available, you can fill up more ice cube trays and produce more frozen ice cubes, given that there is enough space in the freezer to accommodate the additional trays. The perturbation will not have an indirect effect on the freezing process itself, as the factors affecting the water freezing, such as temperature and time, will remain the same. However, adding more trays with water to the freezer might slightly increase the time required for all the trays to freeze completely, because the freezer will need to distribute the cold air and chill the additional trays.

As he gets settled in he reflects on the turn of events in a flashback of his time working at Saint Benedict's Academy, a prestigious preparatory school. Twenty-eight years earlier, a younger Mr. Hundert is enthusiastic about the start of the school year. His class turns out to be a strict yet inspiring lesson for the freshmen. They include laid-back Louis Masoudi, introverted Martin Blythe, and studious Deepak Mehta. Hundert inspires his students to study hard in order to become one of the three contestants for The Emperor's Club and be crowned \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\", an academic competition between top three students of his class regarding the Classics. When the headmaster explains the contest to the students, he mentions that Blythe's father was once a \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\". Hundert's orderly world is shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, walks into his classroom late. Bell is the cocky son of a senior U.S. senator who possesses none of Hundert's principles. After Sedgewick plays the class clown, Hundert asks him to name a single Roman Emperor. When Bell cannot, Hundert has the other students perfectly recite the line of succession of the Roman Empire. Hundert also makes a trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with Senator Bell. Bell's father is uninterested in his son's character development, telling Hundert just to teach Bell so he can graduate. In a phone call, Senator Bell chastises Sedgewick for wasting his fatherâs time and money. After seeing him chastened, Hundert tries to become a mentor to Bell in order to make him a better man.

Problem:Question: What year was the company that imported calico prints to England founded? Passage 1:In the 18th century, England was famous for its woollen and worsted cloth. That industry, centred in the east and south in towns such as Norwich, jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701 only of cottonwool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to . This was due to commercial legislation to protect the woollen industry. Cheap calico prints, imported by the East India Company from Hindustān (India), had become popular. In 1700 an Act of Parliament passed to prevent the importation of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused demand to switch to imported grey cloth instead—calico that had not been finished—dyed or printed. These were printed with popular patterns in southern England. Also, Lancashire businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, known as fustian, which they sent to London for finishing. Cottonwool imports recovered though, and by 1720 were almost back to their 1701 levels. Again the woollen manufacturers, in true protectionist fashion, claimed that the imports were taking jobs away from workers in Coventry. The Woollen, etc., Manufactures Act 1720 was passed, enacting fines against anyone caught wearing printed or stained calico muslins. Neckcloths and fustians were exempted. The Lancashire manufacturers exploited this exemption; coloured cotton weft with linen warp were specifically permitted by the 1736 Manchester Act. There now was an artificial demand for woven cloth. Passage 2:After education at Canterbury Boys' High School (where he was a contemporary of former Liberal Australian prime minister John Howard), Windschuttle was a journalist on newspapers and magazines in Sydney. He completed a BA (first class honours in history) at the University of Sydney in 1969, and an MA (honours in politics) at Macquarie University in 1978. He enrolled in a PhD but did not submit it; instead he published it under the title The Media with Penguin Books. In 1973, he became a tutor in Australian history at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Between 1977 and 1981, Windschuttle was lecturer in Australian history and in journalism at the New South Wales Institute of Technology (now the University of Technology, Sydney) before returning to UNSW in 1983 as lecturer/senior lecturer in social policy. He resigned from UNSW in 1993 and since then he has been publisher of Macleay Press and a regular visiting and guest lecturer on history and historiography at American universities. In June 2006, he was appointed to the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Australia's non-commercial public broadcaster. Passage 3:Quinn emigrated from Canada with a falsified passport and entered the adult entertainment industry in the late 1980s, while she was underage by using a fake ID.

Quinn began performing in adult films at the age of 16 after Boyer introduced her to agent Jim South. Quinn misrepresented her birth year as 1968, which would have made her 22 at the time of her adult film debut. Her first scene was in the film Space Virgins, and it was a five-person group sex scene with two men and two other women, besides Quinn.

Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Cross-country skiing. Yes or no? Answer: The activity is popular in many places with large snowfields, primarily Northern Europe , Canada , and Alaska . Question: what are the different types of cross country skiing Answer:","completion":"Cross-country skiing, also known as Nordic skiing, is a popular winter sport that involves traversing diverse snow-covered landscapes using skis and poles. It has deep roots in the snowy regions of Northern Europe, Canada, and Alaska, and has since expanded to snowy locales across the globe. Cross-country skiing is not only an enjoyable recreational activity but also serves as a low-impact and effective form of exercise with numerous health benefits. There are several different types of cross-country skiing, each with its unique techniques, equipment, and styles. Some of the most common types include: 1. Classic Cross-Country Skiing: This is the most traditional and well-known form of cross-country skiing. Classic skiing involves a forward and backward gliding motion in a set track with parallel grooves, allowing the skier to move efficiently over the snow. The technique relies on diagonal strides, double poling, and herringbone movements for uphill climbs. Classic skis are typically longer and narrower than other types of cross-country skis, with a grip zone for traction during diagonal strides. 2. Skate Skiing: Also known as freestyle skiing, skate skiing is a more recent development in cross-country skiing and involves a lateral V-shaped push-off with each ski, similar to ice skating. The technique requires more energy and power than classic skiing but can achieve higher speeds and is often used in races. Skate skis are generally shorter, lighter, and have a stiffer flex than classic skis, with no grip zone as the entire ski relies on the edges for propulsion. 3. Ski Touring: Ski touring is a form of cross-country skiing that focuses on exploring backcountry trails and off-track terrain rather than groomed trails. This type of skiing often requires wider skis with metal or synthetic grip zones for better grip on untracked snow, as well as climbing skins for steep ascents. Ski touring often places greater emphasis on survival skills, navigation, and proficiency in various snow conditions. 4. Telemark Skiing: Telemark skiing is a hybrid of cross-country and alpine skiing that employs a free-heel binding system, allowing the skier to perform deep knee bends and lunges during downhill turns while maintaining the ability to glide in cross-country terrain. The technique is named after its origin in the Telemark region of Norway and is known for its fluid and graceful movements. Telemark skis are usually wider than traditional cross-country skis, providing added stability and control for downhill turning. 5. Skijoring: Skijoring is a form of cross-country skiing in which a skier is pulled by an animal, typically a dog or a horse. This type of skiing emphasizes the partnership between the skier and the animal, coordinating their movements and speed. Skijoring skis can be either classic or skate ski equipment, depending on the specific preferences of the skier and the requirements of the terrain. Each of these cross-country skiing styles offers different challenges and appeals to a broad array of enthusiasts. Whether one is seeking an intense workout, a serene wintertime nature experience, or an adrenaline-fueled adventure, the diverse world of cross-country skiing has something to offer for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mrs. Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London, England. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby and Judy (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) at university.

Summarize this article: Use a cleanser with some warm water and a soft washcloth to cleanse your face. Gently massage the cleanser into your skin to remove makeup, dirt, and impurities. Rinse well with warm water, then splash some cold water on your face when you finish. Then, blot your face dry with a clean towel. Pour some toner on the pad until it feels damp but not overly soaked. You could also use a cotton ball for this step if it’s all you have on hand. However, cotton pads will soak up less product than cotton balls, which will help conserve your toner. Use the cotton pad to gently wipe the product over your face, neck, and décolletage. Avoid the eye area and be careful not to get product on your lips. Pay particular attention to crevasses and difficult-to-reach areas including the brows, sides of the nose, near the ears, and hairline. The toner will help remove the impurities that the cleanser couldn’t reach, as well as any cleanser residue or salt, chlorine, or chemicals found in tap water. Because a spray application can only dilute impurities, not remove them, you should always use a wiping toner first. However, if you like the refreshing feeling of a misted toner, you can make it an additional toning step after using a wipe toner. Since most toners are water-based, they absorb into the skin fairly quickly. Make sure to let the toner sink in completely before applying other products--this will help your skin retain moisture and protect against impurities. If you use any acne treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide, or additional moisturizers, make sure to apply those to your face after toning. Using the toner beforehand will cleanse the skin fully and allow the acne and moisturizer products to sink more deeply into the skin. Generally, you should apply toner once in the morning and once at night. In the morning, the toner will help remove any sebum produced during the night and balance your skin’s pH. At night, the toner will help complete your cleansing routine by removing any dust, makeup, or impurities that the cleanser missed, as well as any oily residue left over from your cleanser. If your skin is especially dry, you may want to start by using toner only once a day at night. Excessive use of toner may dry your skin out more. If you find your skin getting particularly dry, consider investing in a formula for dry skin to minimize dehydration.

The last riddle he ever gives Oskar is proof that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar who is told \\"If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding\\". On September 11, 2001, Oskar and his classmates are sent home from school early while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, although Oskar is present to answer this call, he is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the building collapses. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, \\"So do I\\". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. He vows to find what the key fits. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to meet each of them to see if they knew his father. He first meets Abby Black (Viola Davis), who has recently divorced her husband. She tells Oskar she did not know his father. One day, Oskar...

Then they asked me to have a family trip. On our trip, we turned on the TV at the motel and saw the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. Seeing it falling down, I said to my kids: \\"I'm going to Afghanistan\\".

In these field clinics surrounded by frightening shoots or deadly bombs, we were eventually serving 27,000 patients a month in a very busy schedule. Tired and nervous, I gradually had a sense of achievement, a sense of purpose, and my depression went away. In the years to follow, I went to Indonesia after the tsunami, Pakistan after the earthquakes, Sudan after the civil warm and Iraq after more and more bombs.

We once set up movable clinics in an area with 19,000 _ , and it was supposed to hold 13,000 originally.

While visiting Arlington National Cemetery last month, Lindsey Stone thought it would be amusing to snap a photo of herself \\"disrespecting\\" the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by flipping it off and pretending to make noise. She later uploaded the photo to her Facebook page, thinking her friends would get a kick out of it as well. To her chagrin, many of the comments she received were decidedly unsupportive of her shenanigans, so she decided to try and nip the outrage in the bud by posting a mea culpa of sorts. \\"Whoa whoa whoa... wait,\\" Stone wrote on October 20th. \\"This is just us, being the douchebags that we are, challenging authority in general. Much like the pic posted the night before, of me smoking right next to a no smoking sign. OBVIOUSLY we meant NO disrespect to people that serve or have served our country.\\" The uproar seemed to die down for a minute, but soon enough the photo found its way to someone with enough time to take the indignation to the next level. A Facebook page called \\"Fire Lindsey Stone\\" was created less than a day ago and has already amassed over 4,000 likes. Started by a former servicemember, the page calls for Stone to be terminated from her job at LIFE, a Cape Cod-based nonprofit that houses adults with learning disabilities. \\"Let her employer know how much of a waste of oxygen this disrespectful person is,\\" wrote the page's creator, who notes that Stone's trip to Arlington National Cemetery was paid for by the organization. Unable to ignore the flood of comments from irate anti-Lindsey Stone activists, LIFE released the following statement a few minutes ago: On Nov. 19 at approximately 6 p.m., we became aware that one of our employees had posted an offensive, inappropriate photograph on her personal Facebook page. The photo was taken at a national historic site in October by a fellow employee during a trip to Washington, D.C. attended by 40 residents and eight staff. The photo has since been removed from Facebook, and both employees have been placed on unpaid leave pending the results of an internal investigation. This photograph in no way reflects the opinions or values of the LIFE organization, which holds our nation's veterans in the highest regard. We are proud to have veterans serving on our staff and board of trustees, and we value their service. The men and women who have selflessly fought and sacrificed their lives to protect the rights and lives of Americans deserve our utmost respect and gratitude. We are acutely aware that this photo has done a disservice to veterans and we are deeply saddened that it was taken and shared in a public medium. The most important question that must now be asked is \\"does Lindsey Stone deserve to have her future employment imperiled — at LIFE or elsewhere — because of an admittedly dumb photo posted in jest on her personal Facebook page?\\" On Fark, where the topic has incited heated debate, one user decried America's \\"out of control military worship.\\" Another user retorted that it wasn't military worship \\"to show a little goddamn respect once in a while.\\" Meanwhile, Stone has deleted all of her Facebook posts save for a few friend requests. It seems unlikely that she will issue another statement, but, at this point, would the Internet even care what she had to say?

UPDATE: Women fired after photo outrage Lindsey Stone was visiting the Tomb of the Unknowns last month on a business trip when she posed for a picture next to a sign that reads “silence and respect.” In the photo, Stone is pretending to yell and she’s showing her middle finger. The photo, taken by co-worker Jamie Schuh, went viral and sparked anger among veterans. “I can understand why veterans would be all upset over this,” says Edward LeBlanc who was in the Air Force for 20 years and served two tours in Vietnam. “It’s disrespectful, she’s telling us to go “F” ourselves and I don’t think that’s real bright and good for anybody.” Some angry comments were posted on the Facebook page of their employer, Living Independently Forever, Inc.,(LIFE) a non-profit organization in Hyannis that helps adults with disabilities on Cape Cod. The uproar forced the organization to post this statement Tuesday afternoon: “On Nov. 19 at approximately 6 p.m., we became aware that one of our employees had posted an offensive, inappropriate photograph on her personal Facebook page. The photo was taken at a national historic site in October by a fellow employee during a trip to Washington, D.C. attended by 40 residents and eight staff.

We are acutely aware that this photo has done a disservice to veterans and we are deeply saddened that it was taken and shared in a public medium.” Stone and Schuh would not comment on camera, but released a statement late Tuesday night: “We sincerely apologize for all the pain we have caused by posting the picture we took in Washington DC on Facebook. While posted on a public forum, the picture was intended only for our own amusement. We never meant any disrespect to any of the people nationwide who have served this country and defended our freedom so valiantly. It was meant merely as a visual pun, intending to depict the exact opposite of what the sign said, and had absolutely nothing to do with the location it was taken or the people represented there. We never meant to cause any harm or disrespect to anyone, particularly our men and women in uniform. We realize it was in incredibly poor taste, and are deeply sorry for the offense we have caused. We would also like to apologize to LIFE, Inc. It is an amazing organization that provides invaluable services to adults with learning and developmental disabilities. We are beyond remorseful that our actions have caused them such undue public scrutiny. The disrespect implied by our picture has nothing at all to do with LIFE’s mission statement or values. We regret having caused any suffering to the staff members, residents, families and friends. Again, we very sincerely apologize to everyone who took offense to the photo. We realize that it was an ignorant and distasteful thing for us to do, but we truly meant no harm. We are deeply sorry. – Lindsey Stone and Jamie Schuh” Lindsey’s father Peter spoke with WBZ-TV about the incident. “She had no intention of upsetting or offending anyone,” says Peter Stone. “It was poor judgment and she regrets every part of it.” Peter says Lindsey loved her job, but there are consequences for every action. “That was a private page,” he says. “She was goofing around and it got taken off the page.” “She is very, very sorry for what she did,” says her mother Jeanne, “and she never meant it to be disrespectful to anybody.” Sarah Wunsch, a Staff Attorney with the ACLU of Massachusetts does not think the women should not lose their jobs over the photo. “Other people have the right to say, ‘I think she’s a jerk or she’s disrespectful.’ I suppose they have the right to call for her to be fired,” says Wunsch. “But it doesn’t mean the employer should give into that.” “Offensiveness shouldn’t be the standard for what gets to be able to be said, because what’s offensive to you may not be offensive to me and vice versa,” says Wunsch. Lindsey’s father says he understands why people are offended. “I don’t think she was reacting to the site (Arlington Cemetery), she was reacting to the sign,” he says. “I’m appalled myself.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Lindsey Stone, who thought it would be amusing to take a disrespectful photo at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery and post it on her Facebook page, faced significant backlash from the public.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” What is Meade promoting to change the situation. Pick the correct answer from the following options: - an initiative on the ballot to amend the state's constitution. - not enough information - a proposal on prison reform. - a national debate.

Movie title: Counter-Attack Movie plot: In 1942, both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union are gathering forces and supplies in one particular sector of the Eastern Front for a major attack. The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man. An eighth German soldier, thought to be dead, wakes up and attacks. In the struggle, the lone lantern is extinguished and Elenko is stabbed in the shoulder. However, Kulkov kills him and regains control of the situation. Oddly, Elenko is certain that one of the Germans tried to help her in the darkness. Kulkov decides to try a ploy. He orders the magician to go around the corner of the main room out of sight of the others. He knocks the German out and then fires one round, making the rest think he has exacted... A:","completion":"In the movie Counter-Attack, it is the Soviets who launch the offensive by sending a small paratrooper unit led by Colonel Semenov behind enemy lines. Their main objective is to attack a German divisional headquarters, capture an officer for interrogation, and gather intelligence on the Germans' plan for their major attack on the Eastern Front. This offensive is essential to the overall plot, as it fuels the tension and conflict between the characters throughout the film. Contributing to the intrigue and suspense in the story is the construction of an underwater bridge by the Soviets, intended to conceal their movement and preparations from the Germans. Meanwhile, the Germans are amassing forces in the same sector, suggesting an imminent face-off between the two sides. The film's title, \\"Counter-Attack,\\" implies that the plot revolves around the theme of strategic maneuvers and actions undertaken by both parties in response to the actions and advances of their adversaries. The movie features an interesting blend of characters, including a resourceful paratrooper named Alexei Kulkov and Lisa Elenko, a local partisan guide. Their efforts, combined with the help of other characters like the partisans led by Kostyuk, make for an engaging and thrilling story. As Kulkov's mission progresses and he gets trapped with the captured German soldiers, the plot thickens, and the audience is left to wonder who among them is the elusive disguised officer. To better determine whether investing in this film proposal is worthwhile, consider the following factors: 1) Genre and audience appeal: Counter-Attack is a war film set during World War II, with a focus on the Eastern Front. The movie offers suspense, action, and drama - elements which have proven to appeal to a broad range of audiences. Moreover, the World War II setting has historically been popular in the film industry. 2) Cast and crew: A strong cast is essential to bring the movie to life, from actors such as George Macready, Marguerite Chapman, and Paul Muni to others who can successfully portray the diverse characters in the script. The crew, including the director and cinematographer, should have experience in creating war films to ensure a high-quality final product. 3) Budget and expected revenue: You should assess the financial aspects of the film proposal to ensure it aligns with your investment goals. This would include expenses like production, marketing, and distribution, as well as potential box office revenues and profit margins. If the project offers a good return on investment, it could be a viable option. 4) Current market trends: Consider the current state of the film industry and audience preferences to determine if this movie proposal is likely to succeed. War films are typically well-received, but it's essential to analyze contemporaneous market trends, competing titles, and international appeal when making your decision. Ultimately, Counter-Attack boasts a gripping plot, compelling characters, and an intriguing historical backdrop, which are key ingredients in creating a successful and engaging film. Assessing the factors mentioned above can help you make an informed decision as you contemplate whether to invest in this film proposal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. - Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province. - An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration). Since \\"the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law\\", the term \\"official language\\" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government. - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - La Sarre is a town in northwestern Quebec, Canada, and is the most populous town and seat of the Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality. It is located at the intersection of Routes 111 and 393, on the La Sarre River, a tributary of Lake Abitibi. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. - Abitibi-Témiscamingue is an administrative region located in southwestern Québec, Canada, along the border with Ontario. It became part of the province in 1898. It has a land area of 57,674.26 km (22,268.16 sq mi). The region is divided into five regional county municipalities (\\"French\\": municipalité régionale de comté, or MRC) and 79 municipalities. Its economy continues to be dominated by resource extraction industries. These include logging, mining all along the rich geologic Cadillac Fault between Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda, as well as agriculture. - Villa rustica (countryside villa) was the term used by the ancient Romans to denote a villa set in the open countryside, often as the hub of a large agricultural estate (\\"latifundium\\"). The adjective \\"rusticum\\" was used to distinguish it from an urban or resort villa. The \\"villa rustica\\" would thus serve both as a residence of the landowner and his family (and retainers) and also as a farm management centre. It would often comprise separate buildings to accommodate farm labourers and sheds and barns for animals and crops. In modern British archaeology, a \\"villa rustica\\" is commonly (and misleadingly) referred to simply as a \\"Roman villa\\". - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - The Canada 2011 Census is a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population on May 10, 2011. Statistics Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, conducts a nationwide census every five years. In 2011, it consisted of a mandatory short form census questionnaire and an inaugural National Household Survey (NHS), a voluntary survey which replaced the mandatory long form census questionnaire; this substitution was the focus of much controversy. Completion of the (short form) census is mandatory for all Canadians, and those who do not complete it may face penalties ranging from fines to jail time. - Statistics Canada, which was formed in 1971, is the Government of Canada government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. Its headquarters is in Ottawa. - Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. - Ville is the modern French word of Latin origin now meaning \\"city\\" or \\"town\\", but the first meaning in the Middle Ages was \\"farm\\" (from Gallo-Romance < Latin \\"villa rustica\\") and then \\"village\\". The derivative suffix \\"-ville\\" is commonly used in English in names of cities, towns and villages. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality (Abitibi West) is a regional county municipality located in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec. Its seat is La Sarre. - The term regional county municipality or RCM (\\"municipalité régionale de comté, MRC\\") is used in Quebec to refer to one of 87 county-like political entities.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training. After reading the above, is \\"1999\\" the correct answer to the question \\"On what date did Abu Zubaydah say, \\"The time for training is over.\\"?\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"1999\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"On what date did Abu Zubaydah say, \\"The time for training is over.\\"?\\" because it happened on November 30, 1999, as mentioned in the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: \\"Which English-born conductor worked with orchestras in Cincinatti, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Hollywood, New York and Houston, and collaborated with Walt Disney to produce the film \\"\\"Fantasia\\"\\"?\\"","completion":"The English-born conductor who worked with orchestras in Cincinnati, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Hollywood, New York, and Houston, and collaborated with Walt Disney to produce the film \\"Fantasia,\\" was Leopold Stokowski. Born in London on April 18, 1882, Stokowski grew up to become one of the most renowned and influential conductors of the 20th century, working with some of the most prestigious orchestras in the world. Leopold Stokowski began his musical studies at a young age, starting with the piano and violin. He attended the Royal College of Music in London and later studied at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1909, he moved to the United States, where he began working as an organist and choir director in New York City. His career as a conductor began in earnest when he was appointed the conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in 1909. In 1912, Stokowski moved on to become the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, a position he held until 1938. Under his leadership, the Philadelphia Orchestra became one of the most highly respected orchestras in the world. Stokowski introduced many innovations and changes to the traditional orchestral setup, including changes to seating positions, emphasizing the importance of the lower string sections, and encouraging the use of \\"free bowing,\\" which allowed musicians more freedom of expression. Stokowski also had a notable career with the San Francisco Symphony, where he served as the principal guest conductor from 1950-1963. He founded the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra in 1945, which was specially created for the prestigious outdoor music venue in Los Angeles. Additionally, Stokowski conducted the New York City Symphony from 1944-1945 and held the title of Music Director for the Houston Symphony from 1955-1961, further adding to his illustrious career as a conductor throughout the United States. Leopold Stokowski's collaboration with Walt Disney on the animated movie \\"Fantasia\\" is perhaps one of his most famous and enduring accomplishments. Released in 1940, \\"Fantasia\\" features eight animated segments set to classical music, which were performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Stokowski's direction. Stokowski not only conducted the music for the film but also served as a musical consultant and helped to shape the overall creative vision for the project. He even appeared in the film as a live-action sequence, sharing an on-screen handshake with Mickey Mouse during the iconic \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" segment. Throughout his career, Stokowski was a champion of new music and was known for presenting world premieres of several important 20th-century compositions. He was also an advocate for bringing classical music to wider audiences, and his work on \\"Fantasia\\" is a prime example of this mission. Leopold Stokowski passed away on September 13, 1977, in Nether Wallop, Hampshire, England, but his legacy as a distinguished conductor and orchestrator continues to influence the world of classical music to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After rejecting the motion, the Praetor and remaining senators are disintegrated by a device left in the room by a military-aligned senator. Meanwhile, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E prepares to bid farewell to first officer Commander William Riker and Counselor Deanna Troi, who are being married on Betazed. En route, they discover a positronic energy reading on a planet in the Kolaran system near the Romulan Neutral Zone. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Commander Worf, and Lieutenant Commander Data land on Kolarus III and discover the remnants of an android resembling Data. When the android is reassembled it introduces itself as B-4. The crew deduce it to be a less-advanced, earlier version of Data. Picard is contacted by Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway and orders the ship on a diplomatic mission to nearby Romulus. Janeway explains that the Romulan Empire has been taken over in a military coup by Shinzon, who says he wants peace with the Federation and to bring freedom to Remus.

Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor.

The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A Lightning Rod on U.T. Board, Regent Is Not Deterred On Feb. 12, Gene Powell, the chairman of the University of Texas System Board of Regents, sent a note to Francisco G. Cigarroa, chancellor of the U.T. System, about the newest regents appointed by Gov. Rick Perry. The new members “all have extensive experience in higher education and all of them are hard core conservatives. And none of them are shy. We will see no ‘break in’ period from these individuals,” he wrote. \\"If I read some of the stuff about me that I read in the paper, I'd be against me,\\" said Alex Cranberg, regent of the University of Texas System. Expanded coverage of Texas is produced by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news organization. To join the conversation about this article, go to texastribune.org. It was an early hint of the changes afoot at the U.T. board and the tense months — some of the most tumultuous in institutional memory, with the regents seemingly pitted against the flagship university in a highly public spat — that lay ahead. Of that new crop of board members, none have received more scrutiny than Alex Cranberg. Sitting in the student center at the University of Texas campus in Austin in early June, Mr. Cranberg, the 56-year-old chairman of Aspect Holdings, a lucrative energy company based in Denver, said the time had come to “push a reset button” on the relationship between the regents and the leadership of the university. Individuals who encountered Mr. Cranberg as an undergraduate student at U.T. — he received a degree in petroleum engineering in 1977 — remember him as a spirited debater who enjoyed challenging others and being challenged in return. And it may not be what he expected, but he has certainly been challenged lately. Suspicion has surrounded Mr. Cranberg from Day 1. First, there was the speed with which he became a regent — one of the most prestigious appointments a governor can bestow upon a Texan. Mr. Cranberg received the nod just two weeks after registering to vote in the state following a move from Colorado for personal reasons. “Frankly, I’ve got a lot going on and would not have moved specifically for this job,” he said. Then there were his associations. Mr. Cranberg is a longtime friend of Jeff Sandefer, the Austin energy investor who wrote a controversial set of seven proposals for changing higher education and has promoted them with Mr. Perry’s aid. “I don’t expect anybody to tell me what to do and have me do it,” Mr. Cranberg said. Of all the regents, Mr. Cranberg was the one closest to Rick O’Donnell, a fellow former Coloradoan and an associate of Mr. Sandefer who had publicly questioned the value of academic research. The U.T. System’s hiring of Mr. O’Donnell as a special adviser to the board was one of the sparks that lit the statewide controversy. (Mr. O’Donnell’s employment was terminated after 49 days, during which he was “unfairly attacked,” Mr. Cranberg said.) At the height of the debate, Mr. Cranberg was widely considered by critics in the Legislature and the academic community to be the ringleader of a bloc of regents who were influenced by Mr. Sandefer and others aiming to, among other things, stage an attack on academic research and coordinate an ouster of U.T.’s president, William Powers Jr. Most recently, after a request for extensive data on all the faculty members in the system, Mr. Cranberg was accused by the same groups of trying to micromanage the universities. “If I read some of the stuff about me that I read in the paper, I’d be against me,” said Mr. Cranberg, who denied all the details of what he called a “caricature.” When Mr. Cranberg heard that his data request was overwhelming the small staff at the University of Texas-Pan American, he asked the university’s president, Robert S. Nelsen, to write a grant proposal for him to personally finance. “It surprised me very much,” Mr. Nelsen said. “It was a very generous offer on his part.” When asked if other universities shared concerns publicly expressed by many in Austin about the data, Mr. Nelsen said: “I know my faculty are concerned and my staff are concerned. We’re not worried, but we would like a better idea of what the data will be used for.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Article:","completion":"Article: Title: Matching Culinary Delights with Liquor: A Comprehensive Approach In the realm of gastronomy, the mastery of combining flavors goes beyond merely pairing food with an appropriate wine. Integrating spirits and liquors into the cooking process effectively open up a whole new world of culinary possibilities. That is why we are diving into the art of matching your favorite foods with choice liquors – a process offering an explosive burst of flavor. To start, the key to any successful culinary adventure is considered measurement and selection of ingredients. Whether it is baking or cooking savory dishes, every ingredient needs to be measured out to create a harmonious interplay of flavors. The same meticulous approach applies when incorporating liquors into your cooking, considering the potent flavors they bring. The involvement of alcoholic beverages in cooking isn't a new concept; chefs worldwide have been using wine, beer, and spirits to enhance their dishes' flavor profiles for centuries. However, when it comes to integrating liquors, not any alcohol will do, and here's why: the 'proof' of a liquor matters significantly. Unlike wines or beers, liquors are intensely flavored, providing a concentrated burst of flavor that can easily overpower a dish if not checked. Opt to choose an 80-proof liquor, or a liquor that is 40% alcohol by volume. This provides just enough alcohol to bring out the flavors without making the dish taste too strong or boozy. Matching the alcohol percentage properly allows the cook to control the flavor and balance of the dish. Now, when it comes to pairing your liquor with the type of food you are cooking, this is where personal preference and a little bit of culinary creativity come into play. For instance, darker liquors such as bourbon, rum, or cognac pair perfectly with rich, hearty dishes like stews, roasts, or even decadent chocolate desserts. On the other hand, clear liquors like vodka, gin, or silver tequila are brilliant at providing a crisp contrast to seafood dishes, or in invigorating a simple serving of fresh fruits. Remember, the essence of pairing food and liquor isn't about overpowering or masking the food's taste. The liquor should complement and accentuate the flavors within your dish. Consider the ingredients you use, the methods of your cooking, and then choose a liquor that enhances these elements instead of fighting against them. It is this synergy between food and liquor that allows for an unforgettable culinary experience. In conclusion, measuring out your ingredients carefully, choosing the right proof of liquor, and pairing it thoughtfully with your food is the secret to an exquisite taste experience. It's a subtle art that when done right, lets you navigate through undefined culinary territories, and explore a world of flavors you never thought possible. From lending a rich depth to your sauces or adding a hint of surprise to your desserts, the proper use and pairing of liquors in cooking can elevate your food to a novel and extraordinary culinary level. By blending traditional cooking techniques with the exciting worlds of spirits, you open the door to bolder, more flavorful gastronomic adventures. So why wait? Unleash your culinary creativity today with the exquisite combination of food and liquor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house? ? The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The old house that was situated near the church in the garden of the present house was the manor of Belton, which belonged to the Pakenham family before it was sold to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. This house remained largely unoccupied as the Brownlow family preferred their other residences elsewhere."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Finally, he got in the car and drove off. Mom & I had just turned around and sat down at our picnic table when all of sudden here was Dad pulling back into the driveway.

In my young life, I’d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. “Mom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I’m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..” The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt.

New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980 by vocalist and guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. New Order were formed in the demise of their previous post-punk band Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year. Their integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. The initial release as New Order was the single \\"Ceremony\\", backed with \\"In a Lonely Place\\". These two songs were written in the weeks before Curtis took his own life. With the release of Movement in November 1981, New Order initially started on a similar route as their previous incarnation, performing dark, melodic songs, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers. The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis' death. Hook commented that the only positive thing to come out of the Movement sessions was that producer Martin Hannett had showed the band how to use a mixing board, which allowed them to produce records by themselves from then on. More recently, Hook indicated a change of heart: \\"I think Movement gets a raw deal in general really - for me, when you consider the circumstances in which it was written, it is a fantastic record.\\" New Order visited New York City again in 1981, where the band were introduced to post-disco, freestyle and electro. The band had taken to listening to Italian disco to cheer themselves up, while Morris taught himself drum programming. The singles that followed, \\"Everything's Gone Green\\" and \\"Temptation\\", saw a change in direction toward dance music. The Hacienda, Factory Records' own nightclub (largely funded by New Order) opened in May 1982 in Manchester and was even issued a Factory catalogue number: FAC51.

The girl was attending the wrong game and realized her mistake ..","completion":"The most probable reason that can be inferred from the given scenario is option (a). The girl had gotten intoxicated and had used profanity while at the game. The details present in the statement point to this explanation. The narrator mentions that their surprise was majorly due to the group of college-aged individuals situated in the second row of the locale, specifically drawing attention to their drinking habits. It is reported that not only had they evidently consumed alcohol, but their conversation was also dotted with profanities, indicating unruly behavior. Out of this group of individuals, a particular girl was escorted out eventually. Though no specific reason is explicitly stated, a logical deduction from the given details would indicate that her removal from the premises was likely due to the inappropriate actions described, which commonly refer to public intoxication and usage of obscene language in a public setting such as a game arena, where such behavior is generally not tolerated in the interest of maintaining a pleasant environment for all attendees. The other options do not find direct or indirect correspondence in the statement. The dissatisfaction with the announced attendance of the game (option b) or attending the wrong game (option d) are not referred to at all. The option c, \\"None of the above choices,\\" is also inappropriate since the behavior of intoxication and use of profanity is indicated in the story. Therefore, by analyzing the given information, we can conclude that option (a) is the most plausible reason for the girl's removal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brett tends to get sick more than his brother Brian as","completion":"his immune system is relatively weaker, which can be attributed to several factors that play a significant role in determining one's susceptibility and response to infections and illnesses. This disparity between the two siblings has been observed and documented by the family from early childhood, and despite numerous efforts to boost Brett's immunity, the phenomenon remains consistent even as they grow into adulthood. The genetic constitution of an individual is a factor that greatly contributes to their immune strength and their ability to ward off infections. In Brett's case, it is possible that certain gene variations or genetic traits he inherited from his parents could have potentially led to a less robust immune function as compared to Brian, who might have inherited a more favorable set of genetic markers. Unfortunately, there is often little that can be done to alter one's genetic predispositions, since they are essentially hardwired into our DNA. Furthermore, environmental factors such as exposure to various pathogens and allergens during early childhood might have played a part in shaping Brett's immune response as he grew older. Lack of exposure to microbes at a tender age or an overly hygienic environment may lead to a less mature immune system. On the other hand, Brian might have experienced just the right amount of exposure, allowing his immune system to develop optimally and reliably. Lifestyle choices also have a significant impact on immune function. Brett's diet, exercise habits, and stress management could also contribute to his heightened susceptibility to illnesses. A diet lacking in essential nutrients, vitamins and antioxidants is generally associated with weaker immunity. Regular exercise helps maintain robust immune homeostasis, while chronic stress has been shown to negatively impact immune function. If Brett's lifestyle habits are less than ideal, this could place him at a further disadvantage in comparison to his brother who may be more conscientious about his health and overall well-being. Moreover, gut health has increasingly been recognized as a key factor in determining the overall immune response of an individual. If the balance of Brett's gut microbiome is less than ideal, this could be another contributing factor to his weaker immune system. The presence of an unbalanced gut flora can lead to increased permeability of the gastrointestinal tract, creating increased vulnerability to infections. It's essential to note that the strength of one's immune function is not solely dictated by any single factor; rather, it is the complex interplay between genetics, environment, and lifestyle that ultimately determines the overall immune capacity. In conclusion, the reason why Brett tends to get sick more often than his brother can be attributed to a variety of factors including genetic predisposition, differences in early life exposure and environmental influences, as well as contrasting lifestyle choices and their implications on gut health and immune homeostasis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But many years ago, there were millions of rats in Newtown. They attacked the cats and dogs. Sometimes a lot of them knocked down a man or woman walking home at night. The rats were very big in size and they hurt many people. The government ordered everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they did not kill many. Then the government decided to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats every day. A government officer put all the dead rats in a big pile . Sometimes a man brought hundreds in one day. After two weeks there were not many rats in the city, but people still brought many rats to the government office. The government officer thought that people were stealing dead rats from the pile. He ordered his men to dig a deep hole and put the rats in it. Soon there were no more rats, and the government did not pay any more money. From the passage we can see that the government officer _ . A) was a very rich man B) was clever C) was afraid of rats D) liked to live in a clean house","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the passage step by step: 1. Newtown had a rat problem, and the government initially asked people to kill the rats. The response was not sufficient. 2. The government decided to pay people for each dead rat, which resulted in increased activity and thousands of rats being killed daily. 3. A government officer was responsible for collecting and disposing of the dead rats. 4. Eventually, the officer thought people were stealing dead rats from the pile to earn more money. 5. The government officer ordered his men to dig a deep hole to bury the rats, preventing theft. 6. After some time, there were no more rats and the government stopped paying. From these steps, we can conclude that the government officer: A) was a very rich man - There is no information about the officer's personal wealth. B) was clever - The officer identified a potential problem (rat theft) and found a solution (burying them), ending the rat issue. C) was afraid of rats - There is no mention of the officer's fear of rats. D) liked to live in a clean house - There's no information about the officer's personal preferences.

If you are having trouble getting enough fiber from your diet alone, then taking a fiber supplement may help to improve your IBS symptoms. Choose bulk forming laxatives because they are the least likely to irritate your bowels. The recommended daily amount of fiber is between 25 to 35 grams. If you are not getting this amount of fiber from food sources, then you can supplement with fiber. Fiber supplements are available as powders, capsules, and biscuits. Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for use. Always take fiber supplements with a full glass (8 ounces) of water. Probiotics may also be helpful for treating your IBS symptoms. Probiotic supplements contain good bacteria that can help to regulate your digestion. Try taking a probiotic for about a month to see if it helps you. A typical dose is between one to two billion colony forming units (also known as CFUs) per day. Make sure that you follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions. Some doctors will recommend a higher dosage for their patients. Check with your doctor for a specific dose recommendation. When choosing a probiotic, make sure that the package provides the name and contact information of the manufacturer, the scientific names of the bacteria strains included in the probiotic, a \\"best by\\" date that states how many of the bacteria will be alive when the product expires, information about how to store the product, and dosage instructions. Avoid any products that make claims that the product will cure or treat a disease or condition. Peppermint oil capsules have been found to be effective for children with IBS. Peppermint capsules seem to reduce the abdominal pain that is common with IBS sufferers. Try taking peppermint oil capsules for a couple of weeks to see if it helps to soothe pain associated with your IBS. A suggested dosage is to take one to two coated 0.2 mL peppermint oil capsules. You can take up to three doses per day. Keep in mind that some people experience heartburn from taking peppermint capsules. Summary:","completion":"Fiber is kind of like a super cleaner for our bodies. It helps to make sure everything runs smoothly in our tummy and can help us if we sometimes have a tummy upset, that's what IBS is. Fiber is found mostly in fruits, veggies, grains and nuts, but sometimes we might not get enough from these, so we might need a bit of extra help from fiber we get in a bottle or a packet - these are called supplements. Just like we need to drink lots of water when we eat lots of fiber foods, we need to do the same if we take fiber supplements. So, always drink a big glass of water when you take them. There are also little good guys, called probiotics, that live in our tummies. They help us digest our food and keep our tummy happy. We can get more of these good guys by taking something called a probiotic supplement. Peppermint oil capsules are kind of like little bodyguards in your tummy.

Bob Dylan, Denzel Washington cited in social media tributes to Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter Updated APR 21, 2014 5:37a ET The news that Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter had died triggered swift reaction Sunday, largely from those recalling the boxer's wrongful murder conviction as immortalized in music by Bob Dylan in 1975 and on the screen in a 1999 movie starring Denzel Washington. Carter spent 19 years in prison for three murders in Paterson, N.J., following convictions in 1966 and 1976. Carter was freed in November 1985 when the convictions were set aside. Although never a world champion, Carter went 27-12-1 with 19 knockouts -- including stopping Emile Griffith in the first round in 1963. The murder convictions derailed his middleweight career and eventually triggered activism by numerous legal experts and celebrities on his behalf. Here's a sampling of reactions Sunday, including a link to Dylan's song (Advisory: The lyrics include language that some may find objectionable): We a lost a great man today, Rubin \\"hurricane\\" Carter, the boxer who was wrongfully accused and became a symbol for racial injustice.

If you live in a cold weather area and you are leaving during a time when inclement weather is a possibility, you want to make sure your pipes are well insulated. Frozen pipes can cause significant damage to your home, and if no one is there to check them after cold weather it may go unnoticed until you return. Go into areas where pipes are at a greater risk of freezing, like the attic and the basement, and check their insulation. Consider hiring a plumber to inspect your pipes if you are worried about their insulation. A neighbor that is checking up on your house should test the faucets while you’re away. If there is no water coming from the faucets, your pipes may be frozen. Ask them to contact you immediately if this happens while you’re away. Before you leave, unplug the appliances in your home that are non-essential, like your microwave, a stereo, a coffeemaker, and lamps you won’t leave on. This protects your home in the event of a power surge or an electrical fire. This is also an energy efficient way to reduce your electrical consumption while you’re away. Before you leave, check that each door and window are securely locked. Having locks installed will do you no good if they are not locked while you are gone! Go through every room of your home and apartment and check that each window and entry door is secure. It is also helpful do a perimeter of your house from the outside. Look for any window screens that look loose or unsecured. This is a good way to keep your electricity and natural gas costs low while you’re away. Adjust the temperature on the thermostat and turn down the temperature on your water heater. You don’t want to turn your thermostat completely off. Depending on your area’s climate, 55 degrees is a good limit for the winter and 80 degrees for the summer. You can also consider monitoring your heat from afar. The most cost-effective way to monitor your heat while you are away is to install a wireless thermostat that you can monitor and program from your mobile phone or device while you are on vacation. Garage doors are an easy way for intruders to enter your home. Manual garage doors can be secured with a clamp or padlock to prevent them from being opened. Turn off your automatic garage door opener if you have one. This will prevent someone with a universal remote from opening the door while you’re away. Summary:","completion":"1.

Updating one's status while in the air indicates that the person is connected to the internet and is sharing their current situation with others, implying an overall positive or enjoyable experience. This may lead some people to perceive the tweet as slightly leaning toward the positive sentiment. Status updating can also suggest that the person is satisfied with the flight's connectivity and services, which might evoke a notion of satisfaction and contentedness.

King Intharacha of Ayutthaya forced the former Kingdom of Sukhothai to recognize his authority in 1410. The king then invaded Lan Na in 1411, seizing Chiang Rai but failing to capture Chiang Mai and Phayao. In the latter battle the two sides may have used early cannons. In 1424 King Borommarachathirat II ascended the throne of Ayutthaya. After a seven-month siege, he captured Angkor by treachery in 1431.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What happened to Rochester during the siege that was made worse by heat and flies? , can you please find it? It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

Paragraph : The full box is harder to move because it has greater mass and therefore greater inertia. Question: Sally is pulling two wagons. The red wagon is full of sand, and the blue wagon is empty. The wagon that will be easier to pull is the red wagon or blue wagon? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the blue wagon will be easier to pull as compared to the red wagon. This is due to the concept of inertia, which is the resistance of an object to a change in its state of motion. The red wagon is full of sand, making it heavier and giving it a greater mass than the empty blue wagon. As a result, the red wagon has a higher inertia, meaning it will be more resistant to changes in its motion. In other words, it will be more difficult to start moving, stop moving, or change its direction. On the other hand, the blue wagon is empty and therefore has a smaller mass. This means that its inertia is lower, so it will be more responsive to changes in its motion, and pulling it would require less effort.

On 17 March 1991, Armenia, along with the Baltic states, Georgia and Moldova, boycotted a nationwide referendum in which 78% of all voters voted for the retention of the Soviet Union in a reformed form. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where did the Armenians living in Baku escape to during the January 1990 massacre?","completion":"During the January 1990 massacre, also known as the Baku pogrom, Armenians living in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, faced violent attacks, which forced almost all of the 200,000 Armenians to flee the city. The Armenians primarily escaped to Armenia, seeking refuge from the violence and persecution they experienced in Baku. They settled in different parts of Armenia, sometimes in the homes of fellow displaced Armenians from Azerbaijan or in temporary accommodations provided by the Armenian government and relief organizations. The events of the Baku pogrom marked a tragic milestone in the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which was fueled by ethnic tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: An enchantress, disguised as an old beggar, offers a rose to a young prince, Adam, in exchange for shelter in his castle from the cold, but Adam refuses. For his arrogance, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and places a spell on the castle. She gives him a magic mirror that enables him to view faraway events, along with the enchanted rose that she had offered. To break the spell, the prince must learn to love another and earn her love in return before the rose's last petal falls on his 21st birthday. If he fails, he will remain a beast forever.Ten years later, a young bookworm girl named Belle is bored of her village life and seeks excitement. Because of her nonconformist ideals, she is ridiculed by everyone except her father Maurice (an odd inventor), the town bookseller, and a vain muscular hunter named Gaston. Despite being popular with the townsfolk, Gaston is determined to marry Belle. She repeatedly rejects his advances.Maurice and his horse Phillipe get lost in the forest while traveling to a fair to present his newest invention, a wood-chopping machine. After being chased by a pack of wolves, he comes across the Beast's castle. Inside, he meets LumiÃ¨re the candlestick, Cogsworth the clock, Mrs. Potts the teapot, and her son Chip the teacup. However, the Beast quickly discovers and detains Maurice. After Phillipe leads Belle to the Beast's castle, she offers to take her father's place. Over her father's objections, the Beast accepts Belle's offer. While Gaston sulks over Belle's rejection, Maurice returns to town but is unable to convince the others to save Belle from the Beast.The Beast sulks in his room when Belle refuses to have dinner with him that night. Despite this, LumiÃ¨re offers her a meal. While he and Cogsworth also give her a tour of the castle, she wanders into the forbidden West Wing. When the Beast inadvertently chases her into the forest by frightening her in frustration, Belle encounters the pack of wolves. After the Beast is injured while fending them off, Belle thanks him for saving her life. He begins to develop feelings for her while she nurses his wounds and he delights her by showing his extensive library. While the two begin to bond in the Beast's castle, in the village Gaston pays Monsieur D'Arque to send Maurice to the town's insane asylum if Belle refuses Gaston's proposal again.Sharing a romantic evening together, Belle tells the Beast she misses her father. He lets her use his magic mirror to see him. She sees Maurice dying in the woods trying to reach the castle. The Beast lets her go out to save him and he gives her the mirror to remember him by. She finds Maurice and brings him home. As Gaston is about to bring Maurice to the insane asylum, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by showing the Beast with the mirror. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston convinces the villagers that the Beast is a man-eating monster and leads them to the castle to kill him.Having stowed away into Belle's baggage, Chip helps Maurice and Belle escape from confinement. Gaston fights the Beast while the servants fend off the villagers. The Beast initially is too depressed to fight back, but perks up after seeing Belle return to the castle.

Here is an article: In the 450 days between his inauguration and his accident, Mr. Corzine notified Mr. Codey that he would be away for all or part of 111 days, and would sleep out of state on 77 nights, according to letters from Mr. Corzine’s chief of staff, Tom Shea, recording the transfer of power. And many of Mr. Corzine’s overnight visits to Manhattan, where his companion, Sharon Elghanayan, lives, are not included in the tally, because of a memo in April 2006 from Zulima V. Farber, who was then the attorney general. “We do not believe that, in the circumstances you describe, an occasional, overnight stay in New York City following a workday in New Jersey and a return to this state in the morning constitutes an absence of the governor that would trigger the devolution of gubernatorial power,” Ms. Farber wrote in response to an inquiry from Mr. Corzine’s legal counsel. “The enlightened view was, use a commonsensical approach,” Ms. Farber, herself one of four people who have served as acting governor during Mr. Corzine’s absences, said in a recent interview. “My memory is that it was a combination of distance and time,” she continued, “so even going out to Long Island by plane, or if the governor goes to Manhattan for dinner, might be O.K.” In contrast to Mr. Corzine, his recent predecessors typically left the state during their first year in office for only a dozen or two dozen days, according to interviews with former governors, their chiefs of staff, and political scientists. Many said new governors typically had little time to travel, as they scrambled to establish a government, pass a budget and strengthen relationships with legislators and other state officials. Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of the investment bank Goldman Sachs who lives in Hoboken, has been away so much that several friends and fellow Democrats said they had urged him to spend more time in New Jersey. Last summer, Page Six, a gossip column in The New York Post, began, “The Garden State whispers are getting louder that New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine needs to learn how to stay at home.” In a recent interview, Anthony Coley, Mr. Corzine’s communications director, made no apologies for the boss’s absences. “Wherever Jon Corzine goes, his work goes with him,” Mr. Coley said. “Jon Corzine burns the candle at both ends,” he said. “He’s a seven-day-a-week type of governor.” Mr. Coley added: “He brings a level of gravitas and business expertise that a lot of people don’t have in his position. So one of his roles as governor, as marketer-in-chief, is to promote his state abroad.” But with Mr. Corzine now facing an extended rehabilitation, his mobility and his approach to his job are likely to change. It will be harder for Mr. Corzine to go on trade missions — like the one to Israel that had been planned for April 14 — or to travel great distances for vacation. “The accident will certainly have an impact on planned trade missions and other officially connected events that occur out of state,” Mr. Coley said. Mr. Corzine, with a net worth valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, has long been accustomed to ducking out of town or out of the country — often on private jets. In his globe-trotting he resembles other wealthy politicians like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who sometimes escapes to a home he owns in Bermuda, and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who has been criticized for being out of the state frequently — about one day in five — and not disclosing his whereabouts. Speaking of Mr. Corzine, Bruce Afran, a Princeton lawyer and a government watchdog, said: “He’s the kind of politician who invests his money in the office, and not the kind of politician who rose up through work in the state. I’m sure his travel reflects that. He’s still thinking in terms of being a corporate executive.” Mr. Afran, who said he generally agrees with Mr. Corzine on issues but who has filed ethics complaints against the governor and others, added: “I think a governor in the end has to commit himself to being here, and hopefully when he recovers, we’ll see more of that, because that’s the only way to solve policy problems.” But several politicians and political scientists said that while Mr. Corzine’s trips were surprisingly numerous, they were not cause for concern given the modern-day communications conveniences of cellphones and BlackBerrys. Others said it was good for the state’s leader to venture far to promote its interests and image. “You’ve got to find a balance,” said former Gov. Christie Whitman, who was out of town perhaps a dozen days in her first year but increased her travel as her national political profile rose, both to give speeches and to participate in trade missions. “You don’t want to miss anything, but you also need to get away once in a while and get some perspective.” In most states, succession is an afterthought, because power is transferred to a lieutenant governor, who, in many cases, was elected on the same ticket with the governor. But when Gov. Jerry Brown of California was spending a lot of time out of state in seeking the 1980 Democratic nomination for president, his lieutenant governor, Mike Curb, a Republican, nominated judges and eased air pollution regulations, leading Governor Brown to sue. The California Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Curb’s actions were constitutional. Under the New Jersey Constitution, the line of succession begins with the Senate president and proceeds to the Assembly speaker, the attorney general and then the transportation commissioner. The general guideline has been that an overnight stay or a day trip beyond the New York metropolitan area triggers succession, according to Michael P. Torpey, who was chief of staff to Mrs. Whitman. During March 2006 and again last August, Mr. Corzine left the state four times. He also spent half of last December out of town, and about a third of this February. The letters from Mr. Shea to Mr. Codey, standard in form, do not mention Mr. Corzine’s destination. But according to news reports, Mr. Corzine traveled to Telluride for five days last July after surviving a crisis over the budget that resulted in a government shutdown. A few weeks later, he was in Italy when the authorities revealed that they had thwarted a terrorist plot in Britain to blow up flights to the United States. Mr. Corzine cut short his vacation and returned home. Mr. Codey said that in 2004-5 while he was acting governor for 14 months after the resignation of Gov. James. E. McGreevey, he left the state for about a dozen days. Similarly, Mr. McGreevey seldom left during his first year, Mr. Codey said, other than to go to Canada to see his daughter from his first marriage. Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean occasionally visited his family’s home on Fishers Island, off the North Fork of Long Island. But in his first year, 1982, he suffered a herniated disk and at one point ended up governing from a bed at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. W. Cary Edwards, who served as Mr. Kean’s chief counsel and attorney general, said that Mr. Kean sometimes worked too much before his hospitalization. “We kept saying, ‘Tom, get out of here!’ ” Mr. Edwards recalled. “There’s a need to pull the plug once in a while to just relax and take care of yourself.” An article on Sunday about the frequency of Jon S. Corzine’s out-of-state travel during his tenure as governor of New Jersey referred erroneously in some copies to the time he has spent outside the state. In the 450 days from his inauguration to his traffic accident on April 12, he was away for all or part of 111 days, not 115, and he spent about a third of February — not half of March — out of state. The article also rendered incorrectly comments on the matter from Zulima V. Farber, then the New Jersey attorney general, in an April 2006 memo. She wrote, “We do not believe that, in the circumstances you describe, an occasional, overnight stay in New York City following a workday in New Jersey and a return to this state in the morning constitutes an absence of the governor that would trigger the devolution of gubernatorial power.” The erroneous version said “circumstance” instead of “circumstances” and omitted the words “and a return.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A29 of the New York edition with the headline: The Governor Of New Jersey Often Wasn’t In New Jersey.

Michel Voss had gone to his niece immediately upon his return from his walk, intending to obtain a renewed pledge from her that she would be true to her engagement. But he had been so full of passion, so beside himself with excitement, so disturbed by all that he had heard, that he had hardly waited with Marie long enough to obtain such pledge, or to learn from her that she refused to give it. He had only been able to tell her that if she hesitated about marrying Adrian she should never look upon his face again; and then without staying for a reply he had left her. He had been in such a tremor of passion that he had been unable to demand an answer. After that, when George was gone, he kept away from her during the remainder of the morning. Once or twice he said a few words to his wife, and she counselled him to take no farther outward notice of anything that George had said to him.

If you’re upset about a situation that recently occurred, take some time to blow off steam before talking to your spouse about it. Initiating this conversation when you’re emotional may not get you the results you desire. Wait until you’re calm. To manage anger or frustration, go for a walk around the block. Do some light stretches. Or take several deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Pull your spouse aside once you’re calm and explain the situation. This can be a tough predicament since your spouse may feel torn between you and their parents. Avoid coming off as accusatory by using “I” statements. You might say something like, “I feel helpless when your mother comes over and brings the kids candy. I have asked her not to, but she keeps doing it.” Discussing difficult matters regarding family can create tension. However, if you and your spouse can’t get on the same page, you’ll have a hard time getting your in-law to change their behavior. Remember that you both want the same things—to live your life without being controlled by your in-law. Stay focused on the common ground between you to avoid a rift. You should approach your in-law about the issue as a unified front. Keep the issues happening with your in-law separate from your relationship with your spouse. Don’t blame your spouse for their parent’s behavior. After you’ve shared your feelings about your overbearing in-law, take an objective approach. Take a step back and get a clearer view of the situation. What's happening that you don't want to happen? What needs to happen to make the situation better? For instance, you both agree that your mother-in-law needs to respect your parenting decisions whenever she’s in your home.

In order to determine the output, position-wise addition is performed among the inner lists. This is how we calculate it: - The first elements of each inner list are 45, -66, and -2. Summing these gives 45 - 66 - 2 = -23. - The second elements are -46, 81, and 87. Their sum is -46 + 81 + 87 = 122. - The third elements are 19, -75, and -15. Their sum is 19 - 75 - 15 = -71. Repeat this process for all elements.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko? English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii.

Step 2: Detail Charnley's first try Josh Charnley opened the scoring in the first half with a stunning display of skill and tenacity. The Warriors were pressing hard on Salford's defensive line when Charnley found a gap in their armor, capitalizing on it with swift footwork and pin-point accuracy to touch down for the first try of the match. Step 3: The opposition strikes back The Red Devils were quick to retaliate, as they continued to showcase their fighting spirit. They refused to be cowed by the early setback and managed to level the score with a well-orchestrated play, putting pressure on the Warriors' defense.

Pollution comes in many ways. We see it, smell it, drink it and even eat it. Man has been polluting the earth. The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problems was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in one place, man moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world. Air pollution is still the most serious. It's bad for all living things in the world, but it is not the only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills our fish and pollutes our drinking water. Noise pollution makes us angry more easily. Many countries are making rules to fight pollution. They stop people from burning coal in houses and factories in the city, and from putting dirty smoke into the air. Pollution by SO2 is now the most dangerous kind of air pollutions. It is caused by heavy traffic. We are sure that if there are fewer people driving there will be less air pollution.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: John is trying to buy a house. Today, he saw two houses, house A and house B. House A was build in the 1920s. It has lead plumbing pipes and lead based paint. House B was build recently. It does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead based paint. But I can use this background: Many chemicals that were once commonly used were later found out to be harmful to the environment , to human health, or both. The element lead was once a common additive to gasoline and to paint. Plumbing pipes were once typically made of lead. Only since the 1970s has the danger of lead become apparent. It causes brain damage and small children (who often chewed on objects painted with lead-based paint) are particularly susceptible. The use of lead in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes is now banned and new materials are being developed to replace the hazardous lead components. What is an answer for this question: Would house A less likely or more likely cause brain damage than house B? A:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to consider the risks associated with living in each of the houses and the presence of lead in their construction. Step 1: Identify risks associated with each house - House A: Built in the 1920s, lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint. - House B: Built recently, no lead plumbing pipes or lead-based paint. Step 2: Analyze the risks relative to the background information - The background explains that lead causes brain damage, particularly in small children who may chew on objects painted with lead-based paint. - Lead was commonly used in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes until its dangers became apparent in the 1970s. Step 3: Assess the likelihood of brain damage in each house - House A has both lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint, presenting clear risks to the occupants. - House B, being built recently, adheres to modern regulations and does not utilize lead in its construction, which makes it safer concerning lead-related health issues. In conclusion, House A would be more likely to cause brain damage than House B due to the presence of lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The former officer, who decided to cultivate lavender in the wild terrain of Elena in Northern Bulgaria, was also appointed as the president of an organization established by growers of ether and other medicinal plants. Let me elaborate further on what this might entail for clarity. The statement seems to come from a news source or an article discussing the ventures of a former officer in Bulgaria. This individual has decided to start cultivating lavender in a wild or undeveloped terrain situated in a place called Elena, located in Northern Bulgaria. Lavender is known for its soothing fragrance and robust nature, making it a popular choice for cultivation. It would indeed be an intriguing task to grow lavender in a potentially challenging environment, given that wild terrains typically require significant work to develop into productive areas of cultivation. In addition to embarking on this project, the second part of the statement informs us that the former officer was appointed the president of an organization. This organization has been established by other growers who specialize in growing ether and various medicinal plants. Ether is a volatile compound often used in medicine and other industries. In the medicinal arena, plants have been used for centuries due to their healing properties. Assuming this officer is involved in both cultivating lavender and leading an organization dealing with ether and medicinal plants production indicates that they are significantly involved in agriculture, particularly in the area of medicinal and aromatic plants. He is likely to use his leadership skills to manage and coordinate the activities of the organization, create avenues for sharing knowledge, blend different experiences, and champion the interests of the growers. From this, it seems that the former officer has successfully transitioned into a significant role within the agricultural sector, specifically dealing with essential and medicinal crops. His position as the president of an organization also elicits a sense of respect and trust from other growers, seeing that he has been bestowed with the responsibility to oversee not just his own venture, but the ventures of other growers dealing with ether and medicinal plants as well. His pursuits will possibly contribute enormously to the progression of medicinal agriculture in Northern Bulgaria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He attended Brookline High School (a 1991 graduate), and played baseball for the Brookline High School Warriors, but dreamed of working for the Red Sox. Epstein attended Yale University where he lived at Jonathan Edwards College. He served as sports editor of the Yale Daily News. On October 12, 2011, Epstein agreed to a five-year contract worth 18.5 million with the Chicago Cubs. On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Epstein's official title with the Cubs would be President and that San Diego Padres general manager Jed Hoyer would take the GM position with the Cubs. On October 23, 2011, he took out a full-page ad in The Boston Globe, thanking Red Sox fans and the team's owners for their support. Two days later, the Cubs officially introduced Epstein as president of baseball operations. While the Red Sox were already a winning team when Epstein was hired in Boston, the Cubs were coming off a fifth-place finish in the National League Central and had a depleted farm system. The Cubs finished in last place in the National League Central for the first three years of Epstein's presidency, as the focus was to acquire young talent rather than maximize short-term competitiveness. After a three-year, top-to-bottom rebuild, the Cubs clinched a playoff berth in 2015; their first since 2008. They advanced to the National League Championship Series, where they were swept by the New York Mets. Epstein re-signed with the club on September 28, 2016, with a five-year contract estimated to be worth up to 25million. The Cubs finished the 2016 season with a 103-58 record, the best in the MLB and their best since the 1910 season. In the playoffs, they defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS. The Cubs proceeded to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, winning their first pennant since the 1945 season and sending them to the World Series.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the person that Pink Floyd hoped that their erratic behavior would be a passing phase? Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\\".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring off into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime \\"See Emily Play\\" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing...

No. The given sentence does provide some valuable information about Thales, a pre-Socratic philosopher, and his non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. However, it does not directly answer the question, \\"What question were Greek philosophers trying to answer?\\" To address that question, let us delve deeper into the thoughts and concerns of ancient Greek philosophers: Greek philosophers aimed to answer several fundamental questions about the nature of existence, knowledge, and morality. Broadly, their inquiries fell into several categories: 1. Metaphysics - Philosophers sought to understand the nature of reality and being. They explored questions such as, 'What is the basic substance of the universe?' and 'How do objects come into existence and change?' Thales believed that the primary substance of the universe was water, while others like Anaximenes posited air and Anaximander suggested the boundless or infinite (Apeiron). Democritus, on the other hand, claimed that everything was made of minute, indivisible particles called atoms. 2. Epistemology - Philosophers questioned the nature and scope of human knowledge, trying to answer questions like, 'What can we truly know?' and 'How do we acquire knowledge?' Empiricism, which suggests that all knowledge comes from sensory experience, was popular among philosophers like Aristotle. In contrast, Rationalism, as proposed by Plato, posits that certain knowledge can be acquired through reason alone, independent of sense experience. 3. Ethics - Philosophers attempted to define the principles of right and wrong behavior. They asked questions such as, 'What is the good life?' and 'How should one act to achieve happiness and virtue?' For instance, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics emphasizes the role of virtue and moral character in achieving happiness. Meanwhile, Epicurus championed the pursuit of simple pleasures to achieve a state of tranquility (ataraxia) and freedom from fear and pain. 4. Political philosophy - Theorizing about the nature of government and the appropriate relationship between individuals and their governments also concerned many Greek philosophers. Plato's Republic envisions an ideal society ruled by philosopher-kings, while Aristotle's Politics examines the strengths and weaknesses of different types of governments (monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy) and highlights the importance of a stable, moderate regime. In conclusion, ancient Greek philosophers sought to answer a wide range of questions, spanning metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and political philosophy. The sentence about Thales does not explicitly address such broader concerns, so it does not provide a valid answer to the question, \\"What question were Greek philosophers trying to answer?\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Complete the following sentence. The spoon was too hot to touch after sitting in the soup, as the","completion":"The spoon was too hot to touch after sitting in the soup, as the soup had transferred all its heat to the metal of the spoon, causing it to reach an elevated temperature. When we immerse a spoon in a hot liquid like soup, heat transfer occurs between the spoon and the soup. This heat transfer is caused by the difference in temperature between the spoon and the soup. The heat energy from the hot soup is transferred to the colder spoon until they achieve thermal equilibrium, which means they end up with the same temperature. The primary heat transfer method in this process is conduction. Conduction is the transfer of heat through a solid material, such as metal or ceramic. It occurs when heat energy is passed from one molecule to another, causing the material to become hotter as the molecules vibrate more. In the case of a spoon in a hot soup, the metal spoon is an excellent conductor of heat, as the metal's molecules are closely packed together. When the soup heats the metal, the energy moves through the metal rapidly, heating the spoon uniformly. As a result, the heat transfer from the soup to the spoon is relatively quick and efficient. However, this makes it difficult to touch the spoon after it has been sitting in the hot soup for a while. Given that the soup has transferred all its heat to the spoon, the temperature of the spoon can become too high for the human skin to tolerate, leading to a sensation of burning or pain when trying to touch it. One solution to avoid burns or discomfort when using a spoon in hot liquids is to use a spoon made from a different material with lower thermal conductivity. For example, utilizing a wooden or plastic spoon could slow down the heat transfer process, making it safe to handle even after being immersed in hot soup. While they might not be as efficient at conducting heat, these alternative materials provide a greater level of safety and comfort for the user."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? A FSBO contract should contain a clear description of any homeowner’s association restrictions on the property. Such restrictions might affect, for example, lawn maintenance or a fence that the buyer wishes to build on the property. Easements refer to another person or landowner’s interest in the property or a portion of the property. One example of an easement is a driveway that two adjoining properties historically have shared. FSBO contracts regularly contain a provision stating that the Buyer is taking title to the property \\"subject to any zoning restrictions.\\" A zoning law that affects a particular parcel of property typically restricts how the owner can use the property. In other words, if a property is zoned residential, the Buyer cannot expect to buy the property and turn it into a store. Another common easement provision includes utility easements. It is common for contracts to include a clause that, for example, \\"permits utility companies to continue using those portions of the property that are necessary for the existing utility services to remain operable.\\" A contract provision relating to another type of easement might state as follows: \\"The property has a 'right of way' running through the southeast section of its grounds, which is clearly marked and allows the adjoining landowner to enter and exit his property as needed.\\" Some disclosures about real estate are required by federal law, and some are required by state law. These disclosure requirements vary greatly from one state to the next. Some states require that you disclose only those defects of which you already have personal knowledge. Other states require a seller to actively search the property for any hidden defects so that they can be disclosed to the buyer. Common examples of defects that may be subject to disclosure are zoning issues, flooding, leaky pipes, and leaky roofs. Some sellers have an inspection done to make sure there are no problems or disclosures to make before putting the house up for sale. Probably the most common disclosure comes from the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. This federal law applies only to houses being sold that were built prior to 1978. The seller must disclose to a buyer about the possibility of lead-based paint being used in the home. Most state laws provide for a specific standardized disclosure form to be filled out by the seller and given to the buyer. Both parties typically must sign and date the disclosure form. It is usually presented by the seller at the closing of the sale. The contract should contain detailed information about any contingency, or an event that can make the contract invalid if it occurs. The buyer would be free to walk away from the contract without penalty if the contingent event occurs. There are some common contingencies that many contracts contain. HSBO contracts are often contingent on the outcome of an inspection of the property. This type of contingency should outline the timeframe in which the inspection should occur. It also should set out which party is responsible for the costs of the inspection. This type of provision can refer to a general home inspection, or a specialized inspection, such as one that tests radon levels. An example of a contingency provision clause in a FSBO contract is as follows: \\"Buyer shall pay for a house inspection, to be conducted before closing. Renegotiation of the agreement will occur only if a major defect, which will cost more than 500.00 to remedy. If the defect would cost less than 500.00 to remedy, then the Buyer shall be responsible for the costs of remedying that defect.\\" Another common contingency involves the ability of the buyer to get financing. Again, this type of contingency should describe the timeframe that the buyer has to find adequate financing. It may even give details such as the amount of financing that is needed and the name of the mortgage company or financial institution providing the financing. The contract also may contain a contingency based on the ability of the seller to obtain suitable housing. Sometimes, the seller wants to make sure that he or she has another place to live before the property is sold and possession given to the buyer. As a result, FSBO contracts may contain a contingency provision like this. The contract should contain information about what happens if either party terminates the contract, which might happen for a variety of reasons. For instance, the contract might provide that if the buyer terminates the contract, the seller will be entitled to receive the earnest money paid by the buyer. This provision might also detail the potential remedies for a party when the other party has defaulted on the contract, such as seeking relief through the court system. For instance, the contract might contain the following provision: \\"If Buyer breaches this Agreement or otherwise fails to purchase the property as agreed, Seller shall retain the earnest money paid by Buyer as liquidated damages or seek specific performance of the Agreement, at his discretion.\\" This provision allows the Seller to either keep the earnest money paid and terminate the contract, or proceed to file a lawsuit against Buyer claiming a larger amount of damages than the earnest money that was paid. Likewise, a FSBO contract might contain the following clause in favor of the Buyer: \\"If Seller fails to deliver title to the property to Buyer at closing as contemplated by the Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and the Buyer shall be entitled to a refund of any earnest money paid.\\" This provision gives the Buyer a specific remedy if the Seller fails to perform the terms of the contract.

Since the policeman and the thief both begin running at the same time, we can assume that they are running in a straight line. We will use the relative speed concept to solve this problem. The relative speed is the difference between the speed of the policeman and the speed of the thief, since they are running in the same direction. Relative Speed = Speed of Policeman - Speed of Thief Relative Speed = 10 km/hr - 8 km/hr Relative Speed = 2 km/hr Now, let's convert the given distance (150 meters) into kilometers to match the units of the speeds. 150 meters = 0.15 km Time taken to cover the distance can be calculated by dividing the distance by the relative speed. Time = Distance / Relative Speed Time = 0.15 km / 2 km/hr Time = 0.075 hours Now, let's calculate the distance covered by the thief during this time. Distance covered by the thief = Speed of thief * Time Distance covered by the thief = 8 km/hr * 0.075 hr Distance covered by the thief = 0.6 km Now, let's convert the distance back to meters. 0.6 km = 600 meters So, the thief will have run 600 meters before he is overtaken by the policeman.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the man who clashes with Robert? Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.

Dirk Bezemer in his research credits (with supporting argument and estimates of timing) 12 economists with predicting the crisis: Dean Baker (US), Wynne Godley (UK), Fred Harrison (UK), Michael Hudson (US), Eric Janszen (US), Steve Keen (Australia), Jakob Brøchner Madsen & Jens Kjaer Sørensen (Denmark), Kurt Richebächer (US), Nouriel Roubini (US), Peter Schiff (US), and Robert Shiller (US). Examples of other experts who gave indications of a financial crisis have also been given. Not surprisingly, the Austrian economic school regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble that could not forestall the disregarded but inevitable effect of an artificial, manufactured laxity in monetary supply, a perspective that even former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in Congressional testimony confessed himself forced to return to. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What did Raghuram Rajan speak of?","completion":"Raghuram Rajan spoke of the \\"Great Moderation\\" during the period leading up to the financial crisis of 2007-08. The Great Moderation refers to a period of economic stability with low inflation and steady growth, which was believed to be a result of improved macroeconomic policies. Rajan was among the few mainstream economists who predicted the crisis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

BARCELONA, Spain -- Barcelona's Argentina striker Lionel Messi will be out of action for six weeks after tearing a muscle in his left leg during Tuesday night's 1-0 Champions League victory over Celtic. Messi is helped off the pitch after injuring his left thigh during Tuesday's 1-0 victory over Celtic. The Catalan club confirmed on Wednesday that Messi will miss both legs of Barcelona's Champions League quarterfinal encounter. It will also be a race against time for the 2007 World Player of the Year runner-up to be fit for the semifinals if Barcelona get past an opponent who will be named after the draw on March 14. Messi picked up the injury after 34 minutes during Barcelona's victory over the Scottish side, which booked their spot in the last eight by easing through 4-2 on aggregate. It is third time in the last three years that Messi has had the same injury, the last occasion being on December 15 against Valencia, which ruled him out of the 'El Clasico' derby the following week against Real Madrid. In addition to his chronic problems with his left thigh, Messi has had four other significant injuries in the last two years which have caused him to miss a month or more. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard has been forced to defend the club's medical services in the wake of Messi's latest injury. \\"To doubt that they are doing their best is an insult. The medical staff and the club in general are working to prevent these sort of problems. They are working hard but there is always a player that can be injured,\\" said Dutchman Rijkaard. Messi's injury reopens the door for Thierry Henry to claim his place in the starting lineup. The Frenchman has rarely impressed since his big-money move from Arsenal to the Spanish giants last summer. Rijkaard also has other options to replace Messi on the right flank in the shape of Portuguese international Deco or teenage Mexican winger Giovanni Dos Santos. E-mail to a friend.

In 1997, Rachel is honoured by her daughter Sarah during a release party in Tel Aviv for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck. In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel—infamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II—and bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as a married couple from Argentina and Rachel becomes a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. At a doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in an ambulance. They attempt to leave by train, but Vogel awakens and sounds the horn of the van where he is being held, alerting guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents have no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction.

By changing all capital letters to lower case letters, the text conversion results in the following: \\"barbell bar with star collars 165 cm by emiliano a cruz on 05.09.2012\\" This text conversion has taken place by following a specific process, which can be explained more thoroughly. In the given text, there are a few capital letters that need to be transformed into lower case letters, primarily located at the start of each word or letter accompanied by a period. English language rules dictate that the first letter of each distinct word (excluding conjunctions and some prepositions) should typically be capitalized. However, the request you made was to convert all text into lower case. To do this, each capital letter has been substituted with its corresponding lower case counterpart. For instance, the first letter of the text, 'B,' has been replaced with 'b'; the second word, 'Bar,' has been transformed into 'bar'; and so on. The capital letters in the name of the individual, \\"Emiliano A Cruz,\\" have also been converted to lower case characters, resulting in \\"emiliano a cruz.\\" The numbers and symbols within the text, including \\"165 cm\\" and \\"05.09.2012,\\" do not have different cases and do not require any conversion. Therefore, they remain the same during the lower case transformation.

(CNN) -- A freight train went off the rails outside Casselton, North Dakota, in the last week of December, spilling a load of crude oil and creating an impressive explosion that prompted officials to evacuate the small town. No one was hurt, but cell phone videos of the fireball were given wide exposure in the media. Here was \\"an airborne toxic event,\\" a phrase Don DeLillo famously used in his novel \\"White Noise,\\" a theatrical catastrophe born of the most quintessential American screw-up: a railroad crash. In addition to its use as shorthand for a failed government initiative or a friend who really ought to quit drinking, train wrecks occupy a contradictory place in the American cultural memory. They are as much celebrated as they are feared, and frequently memorialized in art and song.

From the lower floors of the building, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving through windows with the least chance of serious injury . The second floor windows are usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed, or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked into the room. On a second or third floor, the best windows for escaping are those which open onto a roof . From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely, dropping onto stones might end in injury. Question: From the beginning, we know that it is important to _ . Options: A: know the way to escape a fire B: put out a fire in a burning house C: jump out of a burning house D: keep the door closed","completion":"From the beginning, we know that it is important to A: know the way to escape a fire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The place of the date definitely sets the tone for the date. If you are trying to be more romantic and lavish, reserve a table at a fancy restaurant.","completion":"If you prefer to keep things more casual and relaxed, choose a location such as a coffee shop, park, or a local event. One important element is to consider the girl's preferences – you may want to ask her if there are any places that she particularly likes or has wanted to visit. Keep in mind that the date location should make both of you feel comfortable and excited. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to impress a girl on a first date: 1. Plan ahead: Once the location has been chosen, plan the finer details of the date. This includes the mode of transportation, the time you'll be meeting, and any additional activities that might take place. Planning will not only help you to be more organized but will also show the girl that you put thought into making the date special for her. 2. Dress to impress: Pay attention to your appearance and dress appropriately for the chosen venue and activities. Dressing well demonstrates that you respect your date and the occasion. Also, make sure to practice good hygiene by showering, shaving (if needed), and using pleasant scents moderately. 3. Show up on time: Punctuality is a sign of respect. Arriving on time shows her that you value her time and are excited to see her. If something unexpected happens and you're running late, make sure to communicate this to her as soon as possible. 4. Be confident and engage in meaningful conversations: Confidence is attractive, so believe in yourself and try to be your genuine self during the date. Ask open-ended questions to get to know her better and share interesting stories about your life. Focus on common interests and be an active listener. This will help to create a connection between the two of you. 5. Be polite and considerate: Open doors for her, pull out her chair, and offer to pay the bill. These small acts of chivalry show that you respect her, and she may appreciate your courteous manners. 6. Pay compliments and show genuine interest: Compliment her genuinely on her appearance, laugh, or something she has mentioned. This shows that you are paying attention to her and appreciate the qualities that make her unique. 7. Be attentive to her body language and cues: Reading her body language can help you determine if she is comfortable or whether you need to change the topic of conversation or pace of the date. 8. Avoid oversharing or talking about yourself too much: While it's essential to share your interests, make sure you are also giving her a chance to do the same. Balanced conversation will allow both of you to get to know each other and develop a connection. 9. End the date gracefully: As the date comes to a close, let her know that you enjoyed your time together, and if you genuinely want to see her again, express your interest in scheduling a second date. Remember, always be respectful and ensure she gets home safely. 10. Follow up: If you had a great time and would like to see her again, follow up with her within a day or two. This shows her that you are still thinking about her and would like to maintain contact. Impressing a girl on a first date comes down to being genuine, showing interest in her, and creating an enjoyable atmosphere. By following these recommendations, you should have a greater chance of making a positive impression and building a potential connection for a long-term relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This dog was far from predictable and the last thing I needed was him jumping out and running off with someone's kid. I would probably have to put the chain back on him.

Does \\"The Menzies Government entered Australia's first formal military alliance outside of the British Commonwealth with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States in San Francisco in 1951.\\" correctly answer the question of Which areas were involved in the ANZUS Treaty?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The Menzies Government entered Australia's first formal military alliance outside of the British Commonwealth with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in San Francisco in 1951.\\" correctly answers the question of which areas were involved in the ANZUS Treaty. The main countries involved are Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (hence the name ANZUS, which stands for Australia, New Zealand, United States). The ANZUS Treaty, signed on September 1, 1951, represents a response to the escalating global tensions during the Cold War and was intended to establish a collective defense system between the three participating countries. The Treaty was signed in San Francisco, where the founding conference for the United Nations took place several years earlier. The main reasons behind the establishment of the ANZUS Treaty were to ensure regional stability and shared commitment to defense in the Pacific Ocean. The Treaty was particularly significant for Australia and New Zealand because it marked a shift from their traditional reliance on the British Commonwealth for defense and security towards a new partnership with the United States. The ANZUS Treaty contains 11 articles, with Article IV at its core. This article states that in case of an armed attack on any of the Treaty's members, the other parties of the Treaty shall consult together and determine the necessary actions to maintain the collective defense and security in the Pacific region. However, the Treaty itself does not guarantee any automatic military responses, thus leaving room for flexibility and independent decision-making by the member states. The Treaty has been invoked only once in its history, following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. In this case, Australia and New Zealand offered their support to the United States in the subsequent military intervention in Afghanistan and the broader war against terrorism. Despite the overall successful cooperation between the three countries, there have been some changes and challenges to the Treaty. The most significant one was the partial termination of the Treaty's application to New Zealand in 1986 because of New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy. Although the Treaty has not been formally abrogated, cooperation between New Zealand and the United States took a more informal and separate route, while the Australia-US alliance has continued to prosper within the framework of the ANZUS Treaty. In conclusion, the ANZUS Treaty is a significant tripartite agreement between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, formed in 1951 to establish a collective defense system in the Pacific region. The Treaty marks an important shift in the security partnerships of Australia and New Zealand from their traditional reliance on the British Commonwealth to a new alliance with the United States. It remains a vital part of defense policy for the Pacific region and the participating countries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seed germination and establishment: Before the plant roots can begin to grow, the seed must germinate and establish itself in a suitable location. This is the initial step that leads to plant growth and ultimately to the processes mentioned in the given sequence. 2. The plant roots begin to grow: Once the seed has germinated and established, the roots start to grow and penetrate the rock. 3. Break apart the rock: As the plant roots grow and expand, they exert pressure on the rock and cause it to crack and break apart. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock: Plant roots release acids and other substances that help dissolve parts of the rock, further loosening and breaking it down. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces: As roots continue to grow and acids keep dissolving rock, the rock is broken into smaller and smaller pieces. 6.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1 . Policy . It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration laws. Under our laws, the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is at a designated port of entry at an appropriate time. When an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else, that alien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment under section 1325(a) of title 8, United States Code. This Administration will initiate proceedings to enforce this and other criminal provisions of the INA until and unless Congress directs otherwise. It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. It is unfortunate that Congress’s failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law. Sec . 2 . Definitions . For purposes of this order, the following definitions apply: (a) “Alien family” means (i) any person not a citizen or national of the United States who has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States, who entered this country with an alien child or alien children at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained; and (ii) that person’s alien child or alien children. (b) “Alien child” means any person not a citizen or national of the United States who (i) has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States; (ii) is under the age of 18; and (iii) has a legal parent-child relationship to an alien who entered the United States with the alien child at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained. Sec . 3 . Temporary Detention Policy for Families Entering this Country Illegally . (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary), shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any criminal improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their members. (b) The Secretary shall not, however, detain an alien family together when there is a concern that detention of an alien child with the child’s alien parent would pose a risk to the child’s welfare. (c) The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, upon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law. The Secretary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be responsible for reimbursement for the use of these facilities. (d) Heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, make available to the Secretary, for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry, any facilities that are appropriate for such purposes. The Secretary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be responsible for reimbursement for the use of these facilities. (e) The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores v. Sessions, CV 85-4544 (“Flores settlement”), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings. Sec . 4 . Prioritization of Immigration Proceedings Involving Alien Families . The Attorney General shall, to the extent practicable, prioritize the adjudication of cases involving detained families. Sec . 5 . General Provisions . (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that ends the administration’s policy of separating migrant families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, abandoning the president’s previous stance that only Congress can fix the problem. “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office, flanked by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Vice President Mike Pence. “I think anybody with a heart would feel strongly about it. We don’t like to see families separated.” Story Continued Below Yet Trump said that he wanted to continue enforcing a strong policy at the border, an issue he campaigned on: “We are keeping a very powerful border and it continues to be a zero tolerance. We have zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally.” And the president continued to say that the underlying issue remains one for Congress to fix, titling the document an “executive order affording Congress an opportunity to address family separation.” Administration officials also said that children who have already been separated from their parents won’t immediately be reunited, even if the parents remain in federal custody.

Another spokesman later said Wolfe had misspoken. “It is still very early and we are awaiting guidance,” Brian Marriott, the HHS division’s senior director of communications, said in a statement. “Our focus is on continuing to provide quality services and care to the minors ... and reunifying minors with a relative or appropriate sponsor as we have done since HHS inherited the program. “Reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of UACs“ — unaccompanied alien children — “and the administration is working towards that for those UACs currently in HHS custody.\\" The executive order came after Trump and his team faced harsh criticism from lawmakers, activists, religious leaders and former first ladies over the separation of children from their parents in custody, which was panned almost universally as cruel and damaging to the kids’ well-being. It was a remarkable shift from a president who is typically reluctant to bow to outside pressure. He often doubles down on his existing stance when confronted with criticism. With cable news flashing images of migrant children held in cages and lawmakers’ offices facing a flood of angry phone calls, the president was under increased pressure to come up with a speedy solution. White House aides came to the conclusion on Wednesday that Congress was unlikely to act quickly to resolve the crisis, even though they sent signals that Trump would be willing to sign a narrow, stand-alone fix without other immigration-related provisions. The decision to end the separation policy via executive action appeared to have happened quickly, and some in the White House were left in the dark. Key members of the White House legislative affairs team, which had been working with Hill lawmakers in a bid to find a legislative fix, were left out of the loop and hadn't seen text of the executive action as of early Wednesday afternoon, according to two people familiar with the issue. Nielsen and Justice Department officials went to the White House Wednesday morning to work with administration lawyers to draft the order. The action will direct the Department of Homeland Security to keep families together and will instruct the Department of Defense to help house the families because many of the detention centers are at capacity, according to a person familiar with the matter. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was slated to go to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to brief lawmakers on the administration’s plans. Trump and his top aides, led by Nielsen, have been saying that the law requires them to separate children from parents who were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. Nielsen and Trump repeatedly tried to blame Democrats for the situation at the border, saying that nothing could be done without a legislative resolution. But the separations were the direct result of a DOJ decision in April to prosecute border-crossers as criminals — a change Sessions described as “zero-tolerance.” The separation policy has been applied to most families detained at the border, with children handed over to federal welfare agencies after their parents are taken into custody by U.S. marshals. Nielsen, who had expressed skepticism about moving forward with a zero-tolerance policy without action from Congress, has nonetheless become the public face of the crisis after defending the administration’s position during a tense briefing at the White House on Monday. On Tuesday night, protesters confronted her at a high-end Mexican restaurant in Washington. Nielsen won’t abandon her demands for a legislative solution that would deal with family separations and accomplish Trump’s broader immigration agenda, according to a senior administration official. “We’re still going to be pushing Congress to address this,” the official said. “That’s obvious and that’s not changing.” The official said Nielsen was “a key player” in the talks at the White House on Wednesday morning, and had spent hours there. But the move appeared to take some Homeland Security Department officials by surprise. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement legal team wasn’t clued into the decision, according to a former DHS official with knowledge of the situation. “It sounds like they blindsided everybody,” this person said. “What changed in the last 12, 24 hours? … Either you believe that, operationally, this is what you need to be doing, or you don’t.” ICE declined to comment, and several DHS component agencies did not immediately respond to related requests. The executive action may not put an end to the question of how migrant children are handled at the border. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is already suing the administration on behalf of separated families, said prolonged detention of asylum seekers even as a unit would be unacceptable. “What we don’t want to see happen is we’ll keep the child and parent together but we’re going to detain them for a long time,” said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the nonprofit’s Immigrant Rights Project. “We don’t want to see a situation where they’re building more and more detention facilities. Public outcry over the family separations reached new heights on Wednesday after The Associated Press reported that the administration is placing babies and toddlers in “tender age” shelters. The story capped a grim 24 hours that stood out as a low point even for a White House that long ago grew accustomed to operating in a perpetual state of crisis. On Tuesday night, shortly before the AP story broke, Trump attended a 100,000-plus-per-person fundraiser at his hotel in Washington. Before that, he met with House Republicans at the Capitol, where he sounded off on everything from trade to fighter jets, while only briefly acknowledging the outcry over the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. Yet on Wednesday, Trump announced he’d delay the annual congressional picnic at the White House, planned for Thursday. “I said, you know, it doesn't feel right to have a picnic for Congress when we're working on doing something very important,” he said in a meeting with lawmakers at the White House. “It didn’t feel exactly right to me.” During the meeting, Trump said he hoped his action would be “matched by legislation.” Behind the scenes, White House officials have grown increasingly concerned about the fallout from the policy. Trump, for his part, seemed to vacillate between doubling down on the policy and complaining that Democrats are using the issue to sabotage him politically, and signaling to aides that he wants the issue resolved. “It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something — it never ends!” The president also retweeted a tweet by Darrell Scott, a pastor and Trump supporter, that declared, “Once the mid terms are over, liberals won’t talk about detained or separated illegal immigrant children until 2020. #itsallpolitics.” poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201806/3051/1155968404_5799817983001_5799805714001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" Earlier Wednesday morning, Trump again defended his border security policies, while bashing the news media. The tweet came one day after the president revived the divisive anti-immigration rhetoric that defined his presidential campaign, warning Tuesday on Twitter that immigrants would “infest“ the United States. “The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration,” he wrote on Twitter. “Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the Dems will do anything not to change them & to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!” The swirling controversy has sparked tensions inside the White House and among Trump’s allies, again laying bare the divide between the president’s hard-line advisers, including policy aide Stephen Miller, and more moderate influences. Trump told lawmakers on Tuesday that his daughter and adviser Ivanka — who was widely criticized after posting a photograph of herself cuddling with her infant son amid the crisis — had about the separations. Ivanka Trump tweeted on Wednesday, after the executive order was signed: “Thank you @POTUS for taking critical action ending family separation at our border. Congress must now act + find a lasting solution that is consistent with our shared values;the same values that so many come here seeking as they endeavor to create a better life for their families.” A White House official said on Wednesday that first lady Melania Trump had also been arguing behind the scenes, including in direct conversations with her husband, to end the family separation policy. But others close to the president had encouraged him to double down on the policy, arguing that border security was one of the central pillars of his campaign and is deeply popular with his conservative base. “It’s a mess,” one former White House official said. One Republican former Department of Homeland Security official who has ties to the Trump administration and asked for anonymity to talk about the policy put it bluntly: “I’m ashamed of what they’re doing.” The White House faced a wave of damaging stories about the family separations — from leaked audio of children crying to the revelations about the high cost of detaining children alone. The AP story, which detailed “play rooms of crying preschool-age children in crisis,” struck a particular chord, prompting MSNBC host Rachel Maddow to break down in tears on her Tuesday night television show. Trump’s critics also pounced on an offensive comment by Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, on Fox News. When Democratic strategist Zac Petkanas referenced a report that a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome was among the children who had been separated from her family at the border, Lewandowski could be heard saying, “Womp, womp,” later adding that immigrants give up rights when they cross the border illegally. Lewandowski is still firmly in Trump’s inner circle as an informal adviser and recently joined Vice President Mike Pence’s political action committee. In response to criticism of his remarks, Lewandowski complained Wednesday on Twitter that there was “lots of Fake News today” and argued he simply “mocked a liberal who attempted to politicize children as opposed to discussing the real issue which is fixing a broken immigration system.” While some in Trump’s inner circle have defended the policy, lawmakers in both parties have condemned it. Even the pope has weighed in, telling Reuters that he agreed with recent comments by U.S. Roman Catholic bishops who called the policy “immoral.” During her dinner at a Mexican restaurant on Tuesday night, one protester asked Nielsen, “How can you enjoy a Mexican dinner as you’re deporting and imprisoning tens of thousands of people who come here seeking asylum in the United States?” Nielsen left the restaurant and a DHS spokesman later said: “While having a work dinner tonight, the secretary and her staff heard from a small group of protesters who share her concern with our current immigration laws that have created a crisis on our southern border. The secretary encourages all — including this group — who want to see an immigration system that works, that contributes to our economy, that protects our security, and that reflects our values to reach out to members of Congress and seek their support to close the terrible immigration loopholes that have made our system a mess.” Ted Hesson, Rachael Bade, Eliana Johnson, Josh Gerstein and Stephanie Murray contributed to this report. ||||| (CNN) President Donald Trump on Wednesday reversed his debunked argument that he had no authority to stop separations of undocumented immigrant families at the border, signing an executive order to keep parents and kids together. \\"We're signing an executive order. I consider it to be a very important executive order. It's about keeping families together, while at the same time being sure we have a very powerful, very strong border,\\" Trump said. Trump's climbdown came after he faced intense pressure from across the political spectrum and from religious, political and world leaders to halt the separations, which produced days of heartrending news coverage of crying children -- some of whom were kept in cage-like detention centers. The President claimed, though, that he isn't backing down. \\"The border is just as tough. But we do want to keep families together,\\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \\"We are keeping the family together.\\" Earlier Wednesday after a frenzied morning in which he huddled with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other key officials, Trump first flagged his reversal saying, \\"I'll be doing something that's somewhat preemptive and ultimately will be matched by legislation I'm sure.\\" Just the day before, Trump had claimed his administration's hands were tied without congressional action. \\"Under current law, we have only two policy options to respond to this massive crisis. We can either release all illegal immigrant families and minors who show up at the border from Central America or we can arrest the adults for the federal crime of illegal entry. Those are the only two options, totally open borders or criminal prosecution for law-breaking,\\" the President had said. By Wednesday morning, he had changed course. In the executive order he signed on Wednesday, Trump declared it is his administration's policy to \\"maintain family unity,\\" including by detaining entire families together \\"where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.\\" The order directs other agencies, including the Pentagon, to take steps to find places to house family units. The order specifies that migrants entering the US with children will not be kept together if there's a fear for the child's welfare. Families will also be prioritized in the adjudication process. Even so, the move is almost certain to face immediate legal action challenging the administration's authority to keep families detained at length. The President was not required to sign anything to change the administration's practice that elicited outrage. He could have reversed the practice of splitting children from their parents with a phone call. Executive orders typically require input from the Office of the Legal Counsel. The details of the executive order were worked out between the White House, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, a source said. The White House may run into legal difficulties if the executive order requires families to be held intact together indefinitely since a federal consent decree known as the Flores settlement says children must be released after 20 days. Reversal Trump's decision to relent was a reversal since he had gambled that he could use the plight of the children and public outrage to ram through his hardline changes to immigration police in legislation. The President continued to use tough immigration rhetoric even on Wednesday though, signaling that he is not softening his desire to change the country's laws more broadly. \\"The dilemma is that if you're weak, if you're weak, which some people would like you to be, if you're really, really pathetically weak, the country's going to be overrun with millions of people,\\" Trump said. \\"And if you're strong, then you don't have any heart. That's a tough dilemma. Perhaps I would rather be strong, but that's a tough dilemma,\\" he said. Trump also postponed Thursday's congressional picnic at the White House, an event that is always keenly awaited by lawmakers and their families, saying it didn't feel right. The President's decision came a day after he met Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill who fear that their own political prospects with the midterm elections are being damaged by the separation policy. Democrats welcomed Trump's apparent change of course but said he had only himself to blame. \\"The President is the one that created this humanitarian crisis,\\" Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"I hope the President will fix the problem that he created.\\" Crafting the order While Attorney General Jeff Sessions was not at the meeting at the White House Wednesday morning, his chief of staff has been there to represent the Justice Department, the source added. Prior to Trump's remarks, White House aides refused to comment on rumors of an executive order and Republicans on Capitol Hill seemingly had no knowledge of a coming executive action. Until now, Trump and White House officials have instead been pushing GOP lawmakers this week to pass legislation that deals with immigration reform. The move -- if it retreats from his current stance that the administration is simply following the current law and needs congressional action to stop the separations -- would mark a huge reversal by the President. Both first lady Melania Trump and Nielsen reportedly had roles in the changing course. The first lady has been working for several days behind the scenes, encouraging the President to keep families together, a White House official told CNN. She has had several private conversations with her husband, pushing him to do all he can to keep families at the border intact, whether via a legislative route, or acting alone to stop the process, the official said. The shift in Trump's thinking came an hour after Speaker Paul Ryan said the House would vote Thursday on a compromise between conservative and moderate Republican lawmakers that would address the issue of family separations. The measure would also offer protections to another vulnerable group -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients -- who are undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. But the chances of the bill passing are unclear as is the case with any bill dealing with the volatile issue of immigration. The fact that it includes fundamental changes to the legal immigration system mean its chances in the Senate are even more uncertain. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"President Trump signed an executive order to end the separation of undocumented immigrant families at the U.S. border.

Steven Gerrard is haunted by that momentary slip three matches from the end of last season which pulled the Anfield turf out from under Liverpool as Premier League champions-elect. Given time to reflect plus the priceless gift of hindsight, his most vital loss of footing can now be seen as his stumbling failure nine years earlier to drive through a transfer to Liverpool’s opponents on that fateful April afternoon. Chelsea, who capitalised on that rare Gerrard error to both defeat Liverpool and deflate their title challenge, had made a £32million bid for him in the summer of 2005. Steven Gerrard checks his studs after slipping against Chelsea at Anfield last season. Gerrard lifts the European Cup in 2005 after the greatest night of his professional career. That came just six weeks after he captained Liverpool to the greatest comeback in Champions League final history, that epic victory over AC Milan from 3-0 down in Istanbul. Liverpool instantly rejected Chelsea’s offer. But Gerrard, although still only 25, was already suspecting that if he was ever to win a Premier League title it would have to be with a different team. Sadly, he has been proved right. In fact the drama and emotion of that astonishing night on the banks of the Bosphorous had brought him only temporary relief from that sense of foreboding, which had been nagging at him since Liverpool finished 30 points off the pace the preceding season. So he asked for a transfer. Coming from a very local hero, that request was perceived as heresy by the Liverpool faithful and they took to burning replicas of his shirt in the streets. As the protests reached a crescendo their Stevie G relented. Instead of insisting on his right to join the then-reigning League champions at Stamford Bridge, he signed a new £100,000 a week contract. The rest, as we always say, is history. Except that for Gerrard it is not historic. Since 2005 he and Liverpool have won just one FA Cup and one League Cup – and still no Premier League medal for this valiant war-horse for whom the championship of England has been the Holy Grail since he signed for the club round the corner from his house at the age of eight. Nor is he likely to get one now. Chelsea, in that time, have won their first Champions League, four FA Cups, one League Cup, the Europa League once… and that Premier League title which Gerrard so covets, not once but twice. John Terry lifts the Premier League trophy in 2010 - it is an honour that has eluded Gerrard. Right now they lead the championship race by more points than Liverpool can remotely hope to retrieve and Gerrard is in his Last Chance Saloon, with the light fading. Ah, what might have been. Perhaps a life in English football would have been impossible for him, given how threatening the passions on Merseyside would have remained had he left the club for which he was born to play. But for whatever reason he let his heart over-rule his head, these subsequent nine years have been overflowing from midfield with his commitment to a great club striving to recapture the glory days, and last season so close to doing so. This has become a story of uplifting self-sacrifice in this age when footballers change clubs as often as their socks. Loyalty, however, is oft rewarded by a kick in the head. Gerrard (left), Glen Johnson (centre) and Jordan Henderson on the bench at the Bernabeu. The 34-year-old was also among the subs against Stoke on the 16th anniversary of his Liverpool debut. Gerrard was left out of what might well have been his last huge night in that hallowed red shirt – last month’s Champions League match at Real Madrid. Then he was dropped on his 16th anniversary of becoming a Liverpool player. At 34, this one-club servant finds himself embroiled in turmoil as to whether Liverpool want to contract him to end his career with them – or if even he would prefer now to cash in on his last legs with a move to somewhere like the booming US soccer market. Again, emotions are coming to the boil on Merseyside. The Liverpool skipper celebrates scoring his side's second goal against Leicester on Tuesday. Players past and present are urging him to stay. The fans are petitioning the board to extend his contract. And one of the outstanding players of his generation - the dyed-red Liverpool man who told true-blue Chelsea that he couldn’t quite bring himself to ‘jump off the cliff’ - finds himself back on the precipice. This time with the ground crumbling beneath his feet. Let us hope he makes a happy landing. If the Premier League title is not to be, that is the least Steven Gerrard deserves. Gerrard (third right) poses with fellow Liverpool greats (from left) Ron Yeats, Roger Hunt, Ian Callaghan, Phil Thompson, Phil Neal, Alan Kennedy, Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Robbie Fowler, Jamie Carragher and youngsters Raheem Sterling and Jordan Rossiter, with Ian Ayre and Brendan Rodgers at the front.

What is going on with the team that couldn’t hold on to a dog lead this season, until now. Is it back to the future? Back to the days when one goal was invariably enough for the Gunners? Perhaps not.

Article:","completion":"A Single Juror Stands Between Conviction and a Mistrial in the Michael Slager Case After more than two days of deliberations, a jury consisting of 11 whites and one African-American is unable to reach a unanimous verdict in the trial of former South Carolina police officer Michael Slager, who is charged with murder in the fatal shooting of unarmed black motorist Walter Scott. The jury's foreman informed the judge on Friday that one juror was preventing them from reaching a verdict. The juror in question expressed their inability to convict Slager in a letter read out in court, saying, \\"I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict”. They further elaborated on their struggle, stating, \\"I still cannot, without a reasonable doubt, convict the defendant. At the same time, my heart does not want to have to tell the Scott family that the man who killed their son, brother, and father is innocent. But with the choices, I cannot and will not change my mind.\\" Slager, a white ex-cop, was filmed shooting Walter Scott, an African-American man, in the back as he ran away during a traffic stop in North Charleston in April 2015. The video, recorded by a bystander, went viral and caused nationwide outrage. As a result, Slager was charged with murder. The jury also has the option of convicting Slager of manslaughter, although it remains unclear which charge the 11 jurors are leaning toward. When Circuit Judge Clifton Newman was informed by the jury on Friday afternoon that they were unable to reach a verdict, he ordered them to resume deliberations, emphasizing their duty to \\"make every reasonable effort to reach a unanimous verdict.\\" The jury requested to continue the deliberations on Monday. If they remain deadlocked, a mistrial will be declared. The case reignited the national debate on racial bias and the use of excessive force by law enforcement against black citizens. Slager maintains that he feared for his life during the encounter with Scott, claiming that Scott had grabbed his Taser during a struggle. In addition to the state murder charge, Slager is facing a federal civil rights trial next year. If a mistrial is declared, it will raise questions about the role racial bias may have played in this case. While the majority of the jurors are white, it is crucial to consider that a unanimous verdict is required for either an acquittal or a conviction. The fact that all the other jurors, regardless of their race, were willing to convict Slager, while one juror could not, highlights the complexity of such cases and the division in views on law enforcement’s treatment of black citizens. As the nation awaits the jury's decision on Monday, the outcome of this case will carry significant implications for the ongoing conversation about racism and the relationship between law enforcement and the African-American community in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The phrase \\"gets full mileage\\" suggests that the movie has utilized its resources, potential, and opportunities to its maximum capacity, thus achieving a level of success and satisfaction for both the filmmaker and the audience. When a movie is described as getting its full mileage, it means the movie has met or even exceeded the expectations that come with the genre, theme, or narrative it presents. This could refer to various aspects such as the plot, characters, cinematography, acting, direction, or a combination of these elements. It implies that the movie has been successful in delivering an engaging and enjoyable experience to the viewers, leaving them feeling satisfied and well-rewarded for investing their time in watching it. A positive review like this may encourage others to see the movie as well. Generally, critics tend to assume a balanced approach to reviewing, pointing out both the merits and demerits of a film. In this case, the critic appears to lean more towards a positive assessment, highlighting a notable strength of the movie. This indicates that the overall viewing experience is likely to be deemed worthwhile by potential viewers, making them more inclined to watch it. In summary, the phrase \\"gets full mileage\\" is indicative of a positive movie review. This sentiment is favorable because it shows that the critic believes the movie was successful in bringing to life its intended story and experience.

As enthusiasm for war rose among the English populace, privateers began to attack Dutch ships, capturing them and taking them to English harbors. By the time that Charles II of England declared war on the United Provinces about two hundred Dutch ships had been brought to English ports. Dutch ships were obligated by the new treaty to salute the English flag first. In 1664, English ships began to provoke the Dutch by not saluting in return. Though ordered by the Dutch government to continue saluting first, many Dutch commanders could not bear the insult. Still, the resulting flag incidents were not the casus belli as in the previous war. To provoke open conflict, James already in late 1663 had sent Robert Holmes, in service of the Royal African Company, to capture Dutch trading posts and colonies in West Africa.:67 At the same time, the English invaded the Dutch colony of New Netherland in North America on 24 June 1664, and had control of it by October. The Dutch responded by sending a fleet under Michiel de Ruyter that recaptured their African trade posts, captured most English trade stations there and then crossed the Atlantic for a punitive expedition against the English in America.:68 In December 1664, the English suddenly attacked the Dutch Smyrna fleet. Though the attack failed, the Dutch in January 1665 allowed their ships to open fire on English warships in the colonies when threatened. Charles used this as a pretext to declare war on the Netherlands on 4 March 1665.

Originally published August 7, 2014 at 8:33 PM | Page modified August 7, 2014 at 11:13 PM The search for Jenise Wright has shifted to a criminal probe after the body of a child believed to be that of the 6-year-old was discovered near her East Bremerton home. BREMERTON — The investigation into the disappearance of Jenise Wright shifted to a criminal probe Thursday after a body believed to be that of the 6-year-old was discovered near her home. Although formal identification by the Kitsap County coroner isn’t expected until Friday, detectives said Jenise’s parents had been notified of the discovery and grief counseling was being arranged for the family. An autopsy Friday will determine how the girl died, said Scott Wilson, a spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office. Wilson did not release detailed information about the location or condition of the girl’s body, but said during a media briefing Thursday, “we suspect that she just did not go off by herself and fall into some bushes and die.” He said a suspect has not been identified, but that is now the focus of the local, state and federal law-enforcement officers who have been working the case since Monday. The incident commander, Detective Lt. Earl Smith of the Sheriff’s Office, said the body was discovered in a wooded area that had been searched earlier in the week. He said it was found as searchers began honing in on smaller and smaller areas. “That’s why we search again and again and again,” said Wilson. Frank Montoya Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI Seattle office, said the girl’s body was discovered by his office’s Evidence Research Team with the assistance of K-9 units. Jenise, who was to have started first grade next month, was last seen at about 10 p.m. Saturday when she went to bed in her home in the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park in unincorporated Kitsap County. Her parents noticed she was gone Sunday morning, but were not initially alarmed because Jenise was known to wander freely around the park and find playmates, Wilson said. Her parents began to worry about 8:30 p.m. Sunday and went door to door looking for her, he said. The Sheriff’s Office was alerted about an hour and a half later. Wilson said Thursday there were no signs of forced entry at the girl’s home, and no indication she was taken from her room. On Wednesday, when the focus was still on trying to find the girl, Wilson sought to deflect mounting criticism of the girl’s mother and father and their parenting choices. He acknowledged the delay in contacting law enforcement seemed unusual but said the family lived unconventionally. For example, he said, all the Wright children who were living in the home at the time were sharing one bedroom. Child-welfare workers on Monday removed two children from the home. Wilson also said earlier this week that investigators were aware that Jenise’s father had a criminal history but did not believe it was connected with the girl’s disappearance. According to court records, James Wright was charged with first-degree child molestation in February 2000 for allegedly touching an 8-year-old girl inappropriately after a New Year’s Eve celebration. Court records show Wright was additionally charged with third-degree child molestation six months later after a 15-year-old girl who was baby-sitting the 8-year-old girl during the New Year’s Eve party said Wright touched her breasts and put his hands down her pants, according to the records. Wright pleaded guilty in December 2001 to a misdemeanor assault charge related to the older girl. He was sentenced to a year in jail, but a judge suspended the entire jail time provided he followed certain conditions. Jenise’s parents took lie-detector tests Monday, but investigators are not disclosing the results. The family’s home has been searched at least three times by the Washington State Patrol and the FBI. On Thursday, law-enforcement agents entered the home several times after the body was found, wearing white hazmat protection suits. Police would not disclose if anything was taken from the home. Incident commander Smith, noting authorities had received hundreds of tips, called again on the public for assistance. Investigators are asking residents to call with any information they may have on unusual activity in or around Steele Creek Mobile Home Park from last Friday through Sunday. “We want to know anything you might have seen or heard this weekend,” he said. Anyone with possible information is asked to call the FBI tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI. Christine Clarridge: cclarridge@seattletimes.comInformation from The Associated Press is included in this report.

FBI and other officials have received over 200 leads in the search for the six-year-old. Authorities encourage the public to continue calling in tips and information in the case to 1-800-CALL-FBI. Officials say the case is now a criminal investigation. BREMERTON, Wash. - A four-day search for a missing 6-year-old Bremerton girl ended tragically Thursday, as authorities say they believe they have found the body of Jenise Wright. \\"We are awaiting confirmation of the child’s identity by the coroner; however it appears that the body is that of Jenise. Sheriff’s detectives expect that formal identification may occur tomorrow. The family has been notified,\\" said the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office in a released statement. An autopsy will be conducted Friday by the county’s forensic pathologist. The coroner will determine cause and manner of death, which will help in the case, which officials are now calling a criminal investigation. Authorities in Kitsap County are trying to narrow in on a suspect. They said there have been no arrests in the case, and no cause of death was given. An FBI team using search dogs discovered the body in a forested area near the mobile home park where the girl lived about 11:30 a.m. Thursday. Her family has been notified. The body has been turned over to the county coroner, who is expected to positively identify and determine the cause of death on Friday. The body was found near Still Creek mobile home park. Jenise was last seen there by her family Saturday night when she went to bed. She was reported missing the next day, launching a huge search with more than 100 people and 15 agencies, including the FBI. Searchers like father and son team, Tom and John Holt, said they were hoping for a better ending. \\"It's just closure for the family,\\" said Tom Holt. \\"It's always hard. You always hope you're going to find somebody alive, maybe not hurt but just lost.\\" The sheriff’s office said the discovery was due to a combination of information from the community, a pursuit of the hundreds of leads that have come in and the extensive search efforts. The FBI continues to collect tips at 1-800-CALL-FBI. Community members began leaving items at the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park in honor of Jenise Wright. Others came to offer their condolences and say a prayer for the little girl. \\"I have an 8-year old and she comes down to the neighborhood to play with some kids sometimes, and we are just so heartbroken right now,\\" said Ronald Newton, who never met Jenise but felt like he had seen her before. Investigators also said no arrests have been made, but did not go into detail about whether they believed foul play was involved though they are calling this a criminal investigation. \\"We don't suspect she went into the woods by herself and fall into the bushes and die,\\" said Kitsap County Sheriff's Department Deputy Scott Wilson. The parents took FBI lie-detector tests Monday night, but the results have not been disclosed. Their home was also searched twice by different sets of authorities. Officers have been going door to door at the mobile home park. They were also pulling surveillance video from nearby businesses and checking in with sex offenders in the county. Court records show Jenise’s father, James Wright, was charged more than a decade ago with molesting two girls, ages 8 and 15. He pleaded guilty in Whatcom County Superior Court in December 2001 to a misdemeanor assault charge related to the older girl. It was not immediately clear why the molestation charges were dropped. According to court records, the girl's father was charged with first-degree child molestation in February 2000, accused of molesting an 8-year-old girl following a New Year's Eve celebration. The girl told a detective and case worker that he inappropriately touched her, according to court documents. More than a year later, in June 2001, the charges were amended to include third-degree child molestation after a 15-year-old girl who was babysitting the girl during New Year's Eve 2000 said that Wright touched her breasts and put his hands down her pants, according to court documents. A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail time provided he followed certain conditions, including paying fees. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The investigation into the disappearance of 6-year-old Jenise Wright has turned into a criminal probe after a child's body, believed to be hers, was found near her East Bremerton home.

The film starts with a brief pre-title clip from presenter Greg Palast s aborted interview with Florida Director of Elections Clayton Roberts , who walks out . Palast introduces George W. Bush with particular reference to his popular image as a war hero cemented in the public mind by his landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln for the 2003 Mission Accomplished Speech . However Palast alleges that Bush used his father s influence to gain a draft-dodging placement with the Texas Air National Guard Which he subsequently failed to serve . Palast picks up the story with Bush s 2000 US Presidential Election campaign where he claims Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris used their influence to purge and discount the ballots of predominantly Gore-supporting black voters through the fake felons list compiled by private company DBT/ChoicePoint for US 4 million . Palast goes on to examine the corporate donors to Bush s election campaign , such as Enron CEO Ken Lay , who as members of Bush s pioneer network contributed huge sums through family and friends , and who he claims subsequently profited from the Bush presidency with senior government appointments , no-bid contracts , executive orders and deregulation . Palast outlines what he refers to as the Bush-cycle , where Bush family members use money to gain political office and then use the office to gain even more money , dating back to Senator Prescott Bush who funded the family s entry into the oil business , citing the example of Bush s Harken Energy winning a contract to drill in the Persian Gulf thanks he alleges to Bush Snr s presidency .

I would like to give the app 3 stars. Firstly, the user interface is straightforward and easy to navigate. This makes it relatively simple for someone new to the app to explore its various options. However, I noticed that the design could be more aesthetically pleasing, as it seems outdated and dull. The app's performance is satisfactory, but it lacks speed and efficiency in certain areas. I experienced occasional lags and long loading times which impacted my overall experience with the app. I would recommend the developers to optimize the app's performance in future updates. One major aspect that I appreciated was the app's functionality. It serves its purpose and offers useful tools for users who need it. However, the app's feature set could be expanded to keep up with competing alternatives and provide a more comprehensive experience. Lastly, I found the in-app ads to be quite intrusive; they can hinder the user experience and distract from the app's main purpose. I would suggest offering an ad-free version or reducing the number of ads displayed to improve the overall experience. In conclusion, the com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid app has potential. With some adjustments and improvements in design, performance, and features, this app could compete well with other alternatives in the market. For now, it's an acceptable option for those who need its specific functionalities, but it could be better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I have a new situation: Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture. But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. What is an answer for this question: Which farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, Shallow farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water. Step 1: Identify the farming methods used by each farm. - Bold farm used lots of fertilizers. - Shallow farm used organic methods and permaculture principles. Step 2: Determine the likelihood of nitrogen runoff from each farm. - Bold farm, which used lots of fertilizers, is more likely to have higher nitrogen runoff due to rain dissolving the fertilizers and carrying them away. - Shallow farm, which used organic methods and permaculture principles, is less likely to have high nitrogen runoff as these methods typically focus on reducing synthetic inputs like chemical fertilizers and promoting natural processes. Step 3: Connect the nitrogen runoff to its effect on bodies of water. - The nitrogen in the runoff from Bold farm would contribute to increased algae growth, leading to dead zones in bodies of water. - The organic methods and permaculture practices used in Shallow farm would contribute less nitrogen to bodies of water, thus reducing the chances of creating dead zones. In conclusion, Shallow farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water than Bold farm due to its use of organic methods and permaculture principles, which result in less nitrogen runoff."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

There are two Campfire Circles which are used extensively during the peak camping season. The Large Campfire Circle has a Maori Gatewat which was presented by the Scouts New Zealand in 1951. The Lime Walk, constructed by previous estate owner Margaret Chinnery, surrounds the Training Ground which was the original main lawn area of the White House. Few of the Lime trees survive to this day. On this path sits the Jim Green Gate, a 1930 tribute to Jim Green, an editor of The Scouter magazine. The Buffalo Lawn is so called because of the replica of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was presented by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn is part of the original balustrade of London Bridge which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826. Considered by many to be the most important Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary to popular belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman.

Answer a question about this article: In 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the Pop Idol format to the United States, but the idea was met with poor response from United States television networks. However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox's parent company, was persuaded to buy the show by his daughter Elisabeth, who was a fan of the British show. The show was renamed American Idol: The Search for a Superstar and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job as showrunner but refused; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to Cowell's surprise, it became one of the hit shows for the summer that year. The show, with the personal engagement of the viewers with the contestants through voting, and the presence of the acid-tongued Cowell as a judge, grew into a phenomenon. By 2004, it had become the most-watched show in the U.S., a position it then held on for seven consecutive seasons.

It represents the volume of a cube with each side measuring one foot in length. A cubic inch, on the other hand, represents the volume of a cube with each side measuring one inch in length. To determine the number of cubic inches in a cubic foot, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Understand that a cubic foot consists of a cube with sides measuring 12 inches each, as there are 12 inches in one foot. Step 2: Calculate the volume of the cube in cubic inches. To do this, multiply the length of one side (12 inches) by the width of the other side (12 inches) and by the height (12 inches): 12 inches * 12 inches *12 inches = 1,728 cubic inches So, there are 1,728 cubic inches in a cubic foot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Entity Movie plot: The movie begins as single mother Carla Moran (Barbara Hershey) is violently raped in her home by an invisible assailant. A subsequent episode of poltergeist activity causes her to flee with her children to the home of her friend Cindy (Margaret Blye). They return to Carla's home and the following day, Carla is nearly killed when her car mysteriously goes out of control in traffic. Urged by Cindy to see a psychiatrist, Carla meets with Dr. Sneiderman (Ron Silver) and tentatively agrees to undergo therapy. A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes she has inflicted them on herself (despite the marks showing up in places impossible for her to reach). We learn that Carla suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual and physical abuse, teenage pregnancy and the violent death of her first husband. Dr. Sneiderman believes her apparent paranormal experiences are delusions resulting from her past psychological trauma. Carla is attacked again, this time in front of her children. Her son tries to intervene but he is hit by electrical discharges and his wrist is broken. Dr. Sneiderman urges her to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital for observation, but she refuses. After Cindy witnesses an attack, the two discuss possible supernatural causes. While visiting a local bookstore, Carla happens to meet two parapsychologists, whom she convinces to visit her home. Initially skeptical, they witness several paranormal events and agree to study the home. During their study, Dr. Sneiderman arrives and confronts Carla, trying to convince her that the manifestation is in her mind, but she dismisses him. Reassured that her case is being taken seriously, Carla begins to relax. Her boyfriend Jerry (Alex Rocco) visits and she suffers a particularly disturbing attack, which he witnesses.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Process: - You breathe air in - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"You havent gotten your flu shot\\" happens, how will it affect Your lungs are inflamed with pneumonia. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation \\"You haven't gotten your flu shot\\" has an indirect effect on the process of breathing, especially if your lungs are already inflamed with pneumonia. When you do not get a flu shot, you are at a higher risk of contracting the influenza virus. The flu is a respiratory illness that can lead to complications such as pneumonia, particularly in high-risk individuals like young children, the elderly, or those with pre-existing health conditions. Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs, making it more difficult for oxygen to pass through into the bloodstream and for carbon dioxide to be released when exhaling. In such a case, the process of breathing will be affected as follows: 1. You breathe air in: With inflamed lungs due to pneumonia, breathing may become more labored and difficult as the inflammation narrows the airways, making it harder for air to flow in and out. 2. Air enters bronchial tubes: Inflammation may cause the bronchial tubes to become swollen, further restricting airflow. 3. Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung: As with the bronchial tubes, the bronchioles may also become narrowed due to inflammation. 4. Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs: The alveoli may fill with fluid or pus due to the infection, reducing their ability to effectively absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. 5. Alveoli are surrounded by many small blood vessels: The inflammation can also affect the surrounding blood vessels, causing them to become less efficient in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide. 6. Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels: The inflamed and fluid-filled alveoli impair the transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream. 7. Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body: With a reduced amount of oxygen being absorbed, the blood may carry less oxygen to the body's cells. 8. Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs: The reduced efficiency in gas exchange also affects the removal of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream. 9. Carbon dioxide is released when you exhale: The impaired gas exchange in the lungs makes it harder to release carbon dioxide, causing you to potentially experience shortness of breath and other symptoms. In conclusion, not getting a flu shot can indirectly affect the process of breathing by increasing your risk of contracting the flu, which may lead to pneumonia. This, in turn, causes inflammation in the lungs that impairs the normal breathing process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this \\"A spate of scams in which criminals use technology to take over victims' computers has been reported by an anti-fraud group.\\"","completion":"Title: The Rising Tide of Tech-Driven Scams: How Criminals are Exploiting Technology to Hijack Computers Introduction In recent years, there has been a significant increase in technology-driven scams, with criminals using ingenious and sophisticated methods to take control of people's computers to gain unauthorized access to their personal and financial information. An alarming number of such cases have been reported by an anti-fraud group, highlighting the urgent need to create awareness and educate people on how to protect themselves from falling prey to these scams. The Evolution of Cyber Scams Cyber criminals have come a long way since the days of simple phishing emails asking for personal details. They now employ various tactics to trick victims into granting them access to their computer systems. Some of these tactics include: 1. Social Engineering Attacks: These scams involve tricking people into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that inadvertently grant the attacker access. For example, the attacker may impersonate a legitimate entity such as a bank or government agency and send an email requesting the victim to disclose their login credentials or install a seemingly legitimate software update. 2. Remote Access Trojans (RATs): Cybercriminals can use RATs to gain unauthorized access to an individual's computer. Once the malware is installed on the victim's machine, the attacker has control over their desktop, files, and webcam, among other components. This allows the hacker to carry out nefarious activities, such as identity theft, financial fraud, and the theft of sensitive personal or business information. 3. Ransomware Attacks: In this type of attack, criminals install malware that encrypts users' files, rendering them inaccessible without the decryption key. They then demand a ransom, usually in the form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, in exchange for the decryption key. If the ransom is not paid, the criminal may threaten to delete the files or release them publicly. How Criminals Exploit Technology To carry out their scams, criminals leverage technological tools and weaknesses to infiltrate computer systems. Some of the exploitation methods include: 1. Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities: Many cyber attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in commonly used software applications and operating systems. They take advantage of these flaws to inject malicious code that grants them unauthorized access. 2. Deploying Malicious Software: Hackers can infect computers with malware through various channels, such as phishing emails, malicious website downloads, or infected USB devices. Once the malware is installed on a victim's computer, it can carry out multiple damaging activities. 3. Spear Phishing: Cybercriminals use carefully crafted, targeted emails to deceive recipients into clicking on malicious links or opening infected attachments. These emails may appear to come from a trusted contact, making it difficult for recipients to identify them as scams. 4. Drive-by Downloads: Some cyber-attacks involve injecting malicious software into legitimate websites. This allows them to exploit web browser vulnerabilities and initiate an automatic download of malware, often without the victim even realizing it. Protecting Yourself From Scams The consequences of falling victim to a tech-driven scam can be devastating, both emotionally and financially. Here are some steps individuals and businesses can take to mitigate these risks: 1. Keep Software Updated: Regularly update operating systems, applications, and antivirus software to fix security vulnerabilities and improve overall protection. 2. Employ Multi-Factor Authentication: Use multi-factor authentication whenever possible. This requires two or more forms of verification to access an account, making it more difficult for criminals to gain unauthorized access. 3. Be Aware of Phishing Scams: Learn to recognize and avoid suspicious emails, text messages, and social media posts. Do not click on links or open attachments in unsolicited communications. 4. Use Strong Passwords: Create unique, complex passwords for each account and change them regularly. Avoid using easily guessed passwords like \\"123456\\" or \\"password.\\" 5. Educate and Train Employees: Companies should educate their employees about best cyber-security practices and the importance of maintaining a strong security posture. Regular training and awareness programs can help employees identify potential threats and scams. Conclusion As technology continues to evolve and become an integral part of our lives, it is crucial to remain vigilant against the ever-growing threat of scams. By staying informed about the latest trends in cybercrimes and taking precautionary measures, individuals and businesses can safeguard themselves against the risk of falling victim to these sophisticated scams. The collaboration between law enforcement agencies, cybersecurity experts, and anti-fraud groups will be essential in the fight against these malicious attacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Octavia Estelle Butler was born on June 22, 1947, in Pasadena, California, the only child of Octavia Margaret Guy, a housemaid, and Laurice James Butler, a shoeshine man. Butler's father died when she was seven, so Octavia was raised by her mother and maternal grandmother in what she would later recall as a strict Baptist environment. Growing up in the racially integrated community of Pasadena allowed Butler to experience cultural and ethnic diversity in the midst of racial segregation. She accompanied her mother to her cleaning work, where the two entered white people's houses through back doors, as workers. In the mid-1990s, Butler published two novels later designated as the Parable (or Earthseed) series. The books depict the struggle of the Earthseed community to survive the socioeconomic and political collapse of twenty-first century America due to poor environmental stewardship, corporate greed, and the growing gap between the wealthy and the poor. The books propose alternate philosophical views and religious interventions as solutions to such dilemmas. The first book in the series, Parable of the Sower (1993), features a fifteen-year-old protagonist named Lauren Oya Olamina, and is set in a dystopian California in the 2020s. Lauren, who suffers from a syndrome causing her to literally feel any physical pain she witnesses, decides to escape the corruption and corporatization of her community of Robledo. She forms a new belief system, Earthseed, in order to prepare for the future of the human race on another planet. Recruiting members of varying social backgrounds, Lauren relocates her new group to Northern California, naming her new community \\"Earthseed\\". Her 1998 follow-up novel, Parable of the Talents, is set sometime after Lauren's death and is told through the excerpts of Lauren's journals as framed by the commentary of her estranged daughter, Larkin. It details the takeover of Earthseed by right-wing fundamentalist Christians, Lauren's attempts to survive their religious \\"re-education\\", and the final triumph of Earthseed as a community and a doctrine. In between her Earthseed novels, Butler published the collection Bloodchild and Other Stories (1995), which includes the short stories \\"Bloodchild\\", \\"The Evening and the Morning and the Night\\", \\"Near of Kin\\", \\"Speech Sounds\\", and \\"Crossover\\", as well as the non-fiction pieces \\"Positive Obsession\\" and \\"Furor Scribendi\\".

The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower.

The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller.

This means you have 16 groups of apples (r) that equal 96 in total. Now, we need to find out how many apples (r) are in each group. To do that, we need to divide the total number of apples (96) by the number of groups (16). The math looks like this: 96 ÷ 16 = 6. So, there are 6 apples (r) in each group.

The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments.

(Published Friday, Jan. 25, 2019) Assistant Code Officer Bill Butler said another Rockland resident complained about the signs' size. The city ordinance states residential signs can be no larger than 2 square feet. Reitman’s signs are a little larger than 3 feet by 2 feet. \\"They’re well over the limit,\\" Butler said. He said residents need to apply for permits to display signs like that. They are able to follow an appeals process if their permits are denied. Reitman said she wasn’t aware of the ordinance and feels it should be changed to allow for this kind of political speech. She has until Friday to remove the banners, or else face a fine between 100-1,000 a day.

Susan Reitman has been directed to remove the pro-Trump signs because they exceed the size of signs allowed on residential properties, Rockland Assistant Code Enforcement Officer William Butler said. He said the directive has nothing to do with the signs’ content. “I admire your passion for our president. Truly, I do,” Butler said in a Monday email to Reitman. “However, we have received a complaint and I have to do my due diligence and I have determined your signs are not in compliance with the Rockland Code. “It is your business what you put on the signs. It is the city’s business regarding the size and number of signs.” There was no threat of jail mentioned in the email and the city would first need to file a land-use complaint in court. Jail would be a risk only if a judge ordered the removal of the signs and Reitman refused to follow the court order. The city’s sign ordinance limits residences to one sign, either one that is attached to a structure and is no more than 2 square feet or a free-standing sign of no more than 4 square feet. The gate to Reitman’s driveway has two signs that exceed the size limits, and she also has one on her ranch-style house on Seavey Lane, a dead-end road off South Main Street that has 10 homes. She said the assistant code officer had been on her property earlier this month about a request she had to add a fence and she was not told the signs were in violation at that time. Butler said he received an email complaint from a resident and that he was obligated to respond. He declined to release the name of the complainant, but said the identity would be released if a formal Freedom of Access Act request was made. The Courier-Gazette filed such a request Monday. Reitman said she would not remove the signs, despite the warning from the city. “They can put me in jail. I won’t take them down,” she said. The city ordinance carries a potential penalty of between 100 and 1,000 per day for violations. Reitman said she also will refuse to pay any fine and that the city can place liens on her property if it wants to. She said she is living on a fixed income. “I have the right to support our president. This is about freedom of speech,” she said. Rockland, which had a population of 7,179 in 2016 according to the U.S. Census, has 1,798 registered Democrats and 1,223 registered Republicans. Hillary Clinton won the city’s presidential vote in November, 58 percent to 35 percent for Donald Trump. Both of the state legislators representing the city, one in the House and one in the Senate, are Democrats. Reitman, who is retired and a widow, has lived in the home since 2006. Trained as a nurse, she last worked for Coastal Opportunities in Camden. Maine law allows campaign signs to be on the state road right-of-way six weeks before an election and one week after the vote. State law allows campaign signs on private property if they are not within a road right-of-way. State law, however, says that municipalities can impose stricter regulations. Reitman said that if the signs are within the road right-of-way she would move them to her house. However, Butler said that the law on campaign signs has no bearing on the situation and that he issued the directive because the signs violate the ordinance governing the size and number of signs on a residential property.

What does it mean when a girl mentions her boyfriend in conversation a lot to another guy she just met? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"When a girl sends a picture of her legs while bathing to someone, it can mean different things depending on the context of the conversation and the nature of the relationship between the two individuals involved. Here are some possible interpretations: 1. Friendly gesture: It is possible that the girl considers the recipient a close friend and trusts him enough to share a casual picture of herself. This could just be a way to catch up, start a conversation, or share her relaxation time with a trusted friend. 2. Seeking attention or validation: The girl may be looking for feedback or compliments on her appearance. She could be feeling insecure or needing a confidence boost, and by sharing the picture, she may be hoping for some positive reinforcement or validation. 3. Flirting: In some cases, the girl might be trying to flirt with the recipient or gauge his level of interest in her. Sending a picture of her legs while bathing can be seen as a light-hearted, yet subtle way of suggesting physical attraction or stirring up intrigue. Regarding the second scenario where a girl mentions her boyfriend frequently in conversation with a guy she just met, it can also have multiple meanings: 1. Setting boundaries: She might be trying to make it clear that she is in a committed relationship and not looking for anything romantic or sexual with the other guy. By continuously mentioning her boyfriend, she establishes her relationship status and signals that she is off-limits. 2. Bragging or seeking validation: She could be proud of her relationship and feel the need to share her happiness and excitement with others. By frequently bringing up her boyfriend, she may seek validation for her relationship or want to portray it as a significant aspect of her life. 3. Testing the waters: In some cases, the girl might be trying to gauge the other guy's reaction to her relationship status. If she is unsure about her feelings toward her boyfriend and is exploring other possibilities, she might repeatedly mention her boyfriend to see if the other guy is still interested or stays in contact. Given the scenarios mentioned above, it is evident that the two questions are not the same. While both situations involve some form of communication between a girl and a guy, the context and potential intentions behind the interaction differ significantly. The first scenario deals with a girl sending a suggestive picture, which primarily focuses on the physical aspect and may indicate flirting or a friendly gesture. Conversely, the second scenario revolves around a girl mentioning her boyfriend in the conversation, which can serve as a way to gauge the other guy's reactions and set boundaries or expectations. Therefore, the two questions are distinct from one another and cannot be treated as the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How might humans reduce greenhouse gases? - Available choices: (a). Buy cars that use gasoline. (b). Build power plants that use coal. (c). Use renewable resources to generate power. (d). Use nonrenewable resources to generate power.","completion":"To reduce greenhouse gases, humans could turn towards a more sustainable form of energy production and consumption. Among the options provided, the one most likely to help in achieving this goal is option (c) - using renewable resources to generate power. Here's a detailed explanation as to why that is, and the ways our species might succeed in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 1. Renewable Energy: This is a type of energy that is derived from natural processes that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. This includes sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. The large-scale deployment of renewable energy technologies accelerates our shift from fossil fuels and thus reduces greenhouse gases. For instance, solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity, and wind turbines convert the kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power. Both methods do not emit any greenhouse gases and are considerably friendlier to the environment compared with conventional fuels. 2. Energy Efficiency: In addition to using renewable energy, we can also strive for energy efficiency. This involves doing more with less energy, such as using energy-efficient appliances or improving insulation to reduce the need for heating and cooling. It reduces the amount of energy required for a given service or level of activity. By using less energy, we reduce the demand for fossil fuel energy and thus decrease the greenhouse gases that would be emitted. 3. Green Transportation: Another way to reduce greenhouse emission is by modifying our means of transportation. Vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid vehicles, or biofuel-powered vehicles can decrease carbon dioxide emissions substantially. In addition, encouraging biking, walking, or using public transit where possible also contributes to lower emissions. 4. Sustainable Agriculture: The agricultural industry is another substantial source of greenhouse gases. Sustainable farming practices, such as organic farming, agroecology, and permaculture, can help reduce emissions by sequestering carbon in the soil, reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers, and reducing the amount of methane produced by livestock. 5. Forestation and Reforestation: Planting trees, also known as afforestation, can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the overall impact of emissions. Similarly, reforestation, the process of replanting an area with trees, can restore damaged ecosystems and offset emissions. 6. Widespread Education and Advocacy: Creating mass awareness about the adverse effects of greenhouse gases and global warming can help bring about a shift in public behavior and mindset. As more and more people understand the urgency to act against climate change, it can lead to more sustainable consumer choices and increased political will to implement climate-friendly policies. To sum it up, while options (a), (b), and (d) such as buying gasoline cars, building coal power plants, and using nonrenewable resources to generate power would exacerbate the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, option (c) – using renewable resources to generate power – would indeed reduce the concentration of these gases. However, it should be emphasized that moving to renewable energy sources is just one of many changes that need to be made in the way we live and work if we wish to reduce our carbon footprint significantly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year.

The dog's owner, an attractive young woman, seduces Ace to avoid paying the detective's fee- a feat that Ace hardly resists.Late in the night at Miami Stadium, a group of individuals break in and steal the Miami Dolphins' mascot- a trained dolphin named Snowflake. Next morning, the Dolphin's Head of Operations Roger Podacter (Troy Evans) and his Chief Publicist named Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) are instructed to find the missing Snowflake before the upcoming Super Bowl (out of fear that the theft will affect the superstitious football players). A member of their staff was previously a client of Ace Ventura so they decide to call in this \\"pet detective\\" in to try investigating.Meanwhile, Ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of 25,000 with no success. After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction). Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer and manages to drive the reporters (Antoni Corone and Margo Peace) away.Later that day, Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters. After an altercation with Sgt. Aguado (John Capodice), Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio (Tone Loc) to find out what leads the police may have.

Background: Tyson Cleotis Chandler (born October 2, 1982) is an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Chandler was the second overall pick of the 2001 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers, then was immediately traded to the Chicago Bulls. He has also played for the New Orleans Hornets, Charlotte Bobcats, Dallas Mavericks, and New York Knicks. As starting center for Dallas, he played an integral role in the franchise's first NBA championship in 2011. Context: Chandler was born to Frank Chandler and Vernie Threadgill, though he did not meet his father Frank until later in his life. He grew up in a family farm in Hanford, California, just south of Fresno, California. Chandler began playing basketball at the age of three years on a basket Chandler's grandfather, Cleotis, fixed on a tree. Chandler grew up doing farm work such as milking cows, slopping pigs, and cultivating crops. At the age of nine years, Chandler and his mother moved to San Bernardino, California; he was already nearly six feet tall. As a child, Chandler was teased because of his height; children on his school basketball team joked that he was older than he really was, and that he had been left back several times in school. Chandler and his family then moved to Compton, California, where he enrolled at Dominguez High School, a school known for its athletics, producing basketball players such as Dennis Johnson and Cedric Ceballos. In his freshman year, Chandler made the varsity team and played with future NBA player Tayshaun Prince, who was then a senior. With the Dominguez Dons, Chandler became a teenage sensation; current players such as DeMar DeRozan watched him play and claimed \\"he was like Shaq\\". Point guard Brandon Jennings, who was a ball boy for Dominguez at the time, said, \\"You'd see the girls around Tyson, the Escalade he drove, and you wanted to be like him\\". Chandler earned accolades from Parade Magazine and USA Today, and was selected to the McDonald's High School All-America Team. As a freshman, he was profiled on current affairs TV program 60 Minutes. In his junior year, Chandler averaged 20 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 blocks. In his senior year, Chandler led Dominguez to a state championship and a 31-4 record, averaging 26 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 blocks a game. Chandler was recruited by several universities and considered UCLA, Arizona, Syracuse, Memphis, Kentucky and Michigan. Chandler then declared for the 2001 NBA draft as a prep-to-pro. Question: When did his high school career begin? Answer:","completion":"Tyson Chandler's high school career began when he enrolled at Dominguez High School in Compton, California. As a freshman, he made the varsity basketball team and played alongside future NBA player Tayshaun Prince, who was a senior at the time.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

The former CIA director, whose extramarital affair and shocking resignation made headlines around the world, was deemed \\"irresistible\\" by Walters during her annual special. Petraeus, a decorated military officer, was once praised for his leadership and pivotal role in the US military strategy in Iraq. However, his reputation took a severe hit when his extramarital affair with biographer Paula Broadwell came to light, ultimately leading to his resignation as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2012. Walters described the situation as \\"the keeper of the nation's secrets unable to conceal his own.\\" Although Walters didn't interview Petraeus himself, she did sit down with others who made her list of fascinating individuals in 2012, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. In the interview, Christie addressed critiques suggesting that his weight may impact his ability to serve as president, calling the notion \\"ridiculous.\\" According to the Associated Press, Christie has faced ongoing scrutiny regarding his appearance and how it might affect his political ambitions. The selection of General Petraeus as the most fascinating person of the year offers a unique insight into the events and individuals that have captivated the public's attention this year.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the album that was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically? Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism.

Math Problem Solve -103*t = -497*t - 2869 - 5799 for t.","completion":"To solve the equation -103*t = -497*t - 2869 - 5799 for the variable t, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation. -2869 - 5799 = -8668 So the equation becomes: -103*t = -497*t - 8668 Step 2: Add 497*t to both sides of the equation to isolate the t term on one side. -103*t + 497*t = -497*t + 497*t - 8668 This simplifies to: 394*t = -8668 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 394 to solve for t. (394*t) / 394 = -8668 / 394 t = -22 So the solution to the equation -103*t = -497*t - 2869 - 5799 is t = -22."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the following context: Elliot Hopper is a workaholic widower who is about to land the deal of a lifetime at work, which he hopes will win him a promotion and a company car.

In order to establish a budget with irregular income, you need to know how much you must make in order to continue to survive. Take your monthly expenditures and multiply them by 12 months, and then divide that amount by 52 weeks. Choices: [i] This calculation gives you your financial obligation on a weekly basis. If you get paid biweekly, multiply the weekly amount by 2, and so on. [ii] Your total net income should be a reasonable profit to balance out your monthly expenses. Your resulting income would go to your rent payments and need to probably match the amount you received from insurance broker payments. [iii] Divide in the range from 10 to 75 per month when you reach the ratio you want for the down payment. This calculation will help you determine how much you'll need in the next year in order to maximize your income. [iv] For example, you might divide a total of 250 by 55 weeks , 60 weeks , 52 weeks, and 66 weeks for a total of 180 weeks. Use this total to divide and mark important consumer expenses. Answer:","completion":"[i] This calculation gives you your financial obligation on a weekly basis. If you get paid biweekly, multiply the weekly amount by 2, and so on. The question is asking what we should do after we calculate how much money we need to live for one year, and then divide that into weeks. The correct answer is [i] because it tells us what to do with the weekly amount we just calculated. Answer [ii] is wrong because it mentions profits, rents, and insurance broker payments which are not part of our budget process right now. Answer [iii] is wrong because it talks about a down payment and wanting to maximize our income. We're not buying anything and right now, we're just trying to figure out how much money we need each week to live. Answer [iv] is also wrong because it talks about dividing various amounts by different numbers of weeks. But we've already decided to divide our yearly requirement by 52 weeks, not 55, 60 or 66."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Honey bees are a kind of animal most of us learn about very early. In summer, many people step on honey bees and get stung while walking without wearing shoes. Honey bees are normally about third fourths of an inch long. Most bees are workers, which are female, but some are male, called \\"drones \\". Workers are a little smaller than drones. Honey bees live in a nest, called a \\"hive\\". A hive can have up to 80,000 bees, mostly workers. It usually lies in a tree with a hole inside. The hive is ruled over by a queen bee. She is the largest bee in the hive, and she is the only female to mate. Males usually just hang around; their only purpose is to mate with the queen. Then they die. The workers do all of the work inside and outside of the hive. Their jobs include: caring for baby bees, cleaning up the hive, making honey... Honey bees are usually very friendly, and they mind their own business. They are too busy to worry about people or other animals. If a person is hardworking, we can say he is as busy as a bee. Are you a bee? Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Answer: A:","completion":"Honey bees are aggressive and frequently attack people and other animals.
