Movie plot title: Meri Jung Movie plot: The story begins with a happy lower-middle-class family Arun Verma (Anil Kapoor) an 8-year-old boy, his sister Komal Verma (Khushboo) a 5-year-old girl, his mother (Nutan) and his father (Girish Karnad) living a peaceful life. Arun's parents teach their children through the famous title song \\"Zindagi Har Kadam Ek Nayi Jung Hai, Jeet Jayenge Hum, Jeet Jayenge Hum Tu Agar Sang Hai\\" which means that life is full of problems at every step and still we will overcome all these if we are together.Arun's father is trapped in a murder case. A famous criminal lawyer G.D. Thakral (Amrish Puri) proves him guilty, and he is sentenced to be hanged by the court. Pleas by Arun's mother fail to convince Thakral to be truthful and spare her husband. Thakral asks her to give evidence for his innocence, to which she sadly quotes \\"Jiske paas koi sabut, koi gavanh nahi hote kya we begunah nahin hote\\" (\\"one who does not have any proof or witness of innocence, are they not innocent?\\"). Thakral was adamant to let her husband be hanged. He was hanged as per court's decision. His mother becomes mentally unstable from shock and is sent to a mental institution. Later Advocate Gupta (A.K. Hangal), the lawyer who defended Arun's father, finds out that Thakral had known all along that he was innocent, but only wanted him to be hanged. Arun finds out that Thakral abused the law.Arun's house and all his property is auctioned off by the court. Arun and his sister are not offered help. He grows up with the seeds of revenge in his heart. He becomes a successful defense lawyer and keenly follows every case of Thakral so that some day he can stand up in court against the unbeaten Thakral and beat him.One day Geeta Srivatsav (Meenakshi) comes to him and asks him to fight the case of her sister, Dr. Asha Mathur (Bina) who is accused of killing a patient on duty with her medicine, which she gave from her purse. Arun refuses saying that if she can produce even an iota of evidence of her sister being innocent he will fight for her. Geeta replies...

The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Two brothers went to the doctor's office for a medical exam and blood tests. Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels. Ben however, was told that he had a disease called hypercalcaemia and had to start a treatment for that. Which brother experienced less nausea? Hint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Dan, who is healthy and has normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels, would be the brother who experienced less nausea. This is because Ben has hypercalcaemia, which is characterized by high serum calcium levels and can lead to symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and other complications mentioned in the hint. Dan, having normal calcium levels, would not be experiencing these symptoms related to hypercalcaemia and therefore would have less nausea than Ben."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we're going to talk about a big and expensive project in a place called Aberdeen. This project was meant to create lots of offices, but now it turns out that not many of them are going to be used. Imagine if you built a giant sandcastle with 100 rooms, but then you and your friends only played in 10 of them. That's what's happening here! In this city called Aberdeen, there was a lot of money spent (about £107 million) to build a big group of offices. These offices are like the sandcastle - they're meant to be places where people work and do all sorts of important things. However, some people in Aberdeen who are part of a political group called the SNP said that only a very small part (10%) of these offices would actually be used. Can you believe it? That's like building a 100-room sandcastle and finding out that only 10 rooms will have people playing in them. The rest remain empty and waiting for someone to come and use them.

Question: suppose Male birds get less food because it is too hot happens, how will it affect Females will not hatch more chicks. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of male birds getting less food because of extreme heat would likely have a significant impact on the second effect mentioned, that females will not hatch more chicks. This impact can be analyzed through various factors that influence the reproductive success and overall life cycle of birds. Firstly, when male birds receive less food, their ability to perform essential tasks such as territory defense, courtship displays, and mate attraction could be diminished due to reduced energy reserves. A decrease in these critical behaviors may lead to fewer mating opportunities for male birds, which would subsequently reduce the number of fertilized eggs produced by females. In this scenario, there would be a lessened possibility of females hatching more chicks, as fewer males are energetically capable of engaging in successful mating behaviors. Secondly, inadequate food for male birds could result in a decline of their overall health and survival rates. With less food available to them, males may become weaker, more susceptible to diseases, and less able to evade or fight off predators. This further reduction in the number of viable male birds in a population would increase competition among females, possibly lowering the probability of females finding mates and, consequently, hatching more chicks. Thirdly, the female birds may also suffer from indirect consequences of the decrease in food intake of male birds. As it is not uncommon for both parents to share the responsibility of parenting, a weakening male partner due to insufficient nutrition may struggle to provide food for the female and the chicks, or adequately protect the nest. This could lead to females investing less energy in laying eggs and hatching more chicks, thereby prioritizing their own survival and that of their existing offspring. In this case, having less available male support could lead to a significant reduction in female birds hatching more chicks. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of male birds receiving less food due to extreme heat would most likely have a considerable negative effect on the second effect mentioned, that females will not hatch more chicks. This occurs as a result of a chain of consequences exerted by the decreased food availability for male birds, including diminished reproductive behaviors, reduced overall health and survival rates, and potential indirect impacts on female birds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The company is pushing out an update Wednesday that makes its much-talked-about timeline redesign official. The new feature will show tweets that are sorted based on relevancy, rather than only chronology, at the top of your timeline. Twitter said the changes would arrive on Wednesday, but most users are still waiting to see them. While this is a significant update for Twitter, it's by no means the end of the reverse-chronological timeline, which has been one of the service's signature features, despite the fears of vocal users. Image: Mashable Composite The change is strictly opt-in — at least for now. As of today, you won't see the feature unless you manually activate it in your account settings. This will, however, change at some point in the next few weeks. After the feature has been out in the wild long enough for people to get used to it, the company will switch it on for everyone — though users will still be able to opt out through their settings. What does this look like? The change will look very similar to the previous tests we've seen (which are now over). If you have \\"Show me the best tweets first\\" enabled, you may see a chunk of non-chronological tweets (as many as a dozen) at the top of your timeline each time you open the app. But, other than the timestamps, your timeline itself won't look much different and refreshing your timeline will revert back to chronological order, though the \\"best tweets will still appear. Exactly how many tweets appear in the groups of \\"best\\" tweets will vary from user to user, though it will likely be based on the number of people you follow. Twitter hasn't officially said what factors it takes into account in determining which tweets \\"you’re most likely to care about,\\" though senior engineering manager Mike Jahr noted in Wednesday's announcement that they are meant to represent the \\"most important tweets from the people you follow.\\" (Update: Twitter provides a vague description over on its ads blog: \\"We look at accounts they interact with, Tweets they usually engage with, interests, and what’s going on in their network.\\") If this sounds similar to \\"While you were away,\\" a separate feature that aims to recap tweets you may have missed in between sessions, that's because it is. But despite their similarities, \\"While you were away,\\" which Twitter launched over a year ago, isn't going anywhere. This is how you can activate Twitter's new Home timeline feature once it rolls out to all users (via Twitter) pic.twitter.com/i1afPh04pZ — Brian Ries (@moneyries) February 10, 2016 Importantly, there is a (somewhat murky) distinction: \\"While you were away,\\" is still reserved to recap tweets when you've gone significant stretches of time between browsing sessions and may not always appear at the very top of your timeline. The new \\"best tweets first\\" feature, however, will always appear at the top each time you open the app or website. That's because it still prioritizes the most recent tweets, so the tweets that appear at the top will still be among the most recent for your timeline (rather than a sampling from the last few hours). What's next If there's a truism for social media companies, it's that they're never done experimenting, no matter how many people complain. Just as Facebook continues to tweak its News Feed, Twitter will likely continue to make adjustments to users' timelines. The extent to which it changes things, though, will likely depend — at least in part — on how users (and investors) respond. The move couldn't come at a more critical time for Twitter. The company's stock has been spiraling down to new lows for weeks, as Wall Street cools on a number of once-hyped Silicon Valley darlings. That the company would unveil the long-rumored feature one day after releasing a new ad product that allows advertisers to buy placement at the top of timelines (and hours before it reports earnings) is hardly a coincidence. Whether a few algorithmically curated tweets is enough to move the needle is another matter. Marketers, at least, appear to be cautiously optimistic, even as the rest of Twitter seems to predict its imminent demise. While only it's too soon to tell which camp will be right, one thing is certain: Twitter can now tell you who said it best.

They tweeted using the #RIPTwitter hashtag to express disapproval, causing it to become the top Twitter trend only a few hours after the rumor emerged. Algorithmic Timeline Rumored To Come Friday evening, Buzzfeed broke the unconfirmed news that next week, Twitter intends to introduce an “algorithmic” timeline, one where tweets aren’t ordered by the regular first-in, last-out chronological fashion but instead where an algorithm decides what to display. You know, like Facebook. Twitter hasn’t commented to confirm or deny this, to BuzzFeed or any other publication that I’ve seen, including Marketing Land. We received a “no comment” when asking about it. But there’s every reason to expect it could be true, especially given that Twitter began testing this last December. New Timeline Likely To Be Optional There’s also every reason to believe that this will also be an optional choice for users. That’s what Josh Sternberg, a former reporter and now director of branded content for NBC News, tweeted: Sources at Twitter tell me algorithms are strictly opt in. — Josh Sternberg (@joshsternberg) February 6, 2016 It also makes sense given that changing the default timeline to an algorithmic one would be a huge gamble, a risk of upsetting Twitter’s millions of existing users. Some might like it, but others might not. Postscript (2:00 p.m. ET): Major Twitter investor Chris Sacca also sees it unlikely that the live timeline will disappear: There is a 0% chance Twitter eliminates the chronological feed. — Chris Sacca (@sacca) February 6, 2016 Concern Over Changes Fuels #RIPTwitter Certainly judging from the trending hashtag, many don’t even like the idea of it. Here are just a few examples: Yo Twitter, what's this about an algorithmic feed?

One of the great rewards of being an adult is deciding ON YOUR OWN who (and what) you should be interested in. #RIPTwitter — Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) February 6, 2016 Actor William Shatner and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda are among other celebrities who are not happy. See our related story: Celebrities Tweeting #RIPTwitter Against Twitter Timeline Change. There’s plenty of fear that Twitter will turn into Facebook, which is clearly not what many using Twitter want. Reassurances that this might just be an option may not resonate with some. There are plenty expressing concern about how the change from favorites and stars to likes and hearts was forced upon them. Others are concerned that longer, perhaps 10,000-character tweets, might come and change the service. There’s also any number of people who are frustrated that with all the activity Twitter has been doing to push new products and features, it still hasn’t done the one thing many are pleading for: allow tweets to be edited after posting. Why’s Twitter Thinking About This? There’s a good reason why Twitter might want to add an algorithmic timeline to its service. That’s because it can be useful. There is indeed a lot of “noise” that can drown out the “signal” on the service, where it can be hard to find popular or interesting tweets if you’re just browsing for general entertainment. In particular, there’s a strong sense in some quarters — not necessarily true — that Twitter isn’t helpful or friendly to new users, plus a thought that existing users might not engage as much because there’s so much noise. In turn, this has investors in particular worried about Twitter, which puts pressure on Twitter to look at ways to change. That pressure isn’t going to disappear. Unfortunately, Twitter will constantly be compared to Facebook in terms of financial performance and expectations, even though the two services are fundamentally different. Facebook is a huge social platform that has multiple brands and serves multiple needs. Twitter remains largely what Twitter has always been, a social media outlet where people talk directly to each other about others and about things in general. Clearing Up Some Myths & Confusion As said, it’s unlikely that Twitter will change the default timeline in the short term. Anyone assuming that really should relax. Even in the longer term, this seems unlikely. Certainly, it would be an incredibly stupid move. As I’ve written before, Twitter is like live TV to Facebook’s DVR-style of social media. Twitter is the place where people all over the world have live conversations with each other. It’s where they watch in amazement as celebrities converse with each other (or fight with each other). These conversations are the deep, rich content that Facebook only wishes it had, to the degree that last week, Facebook came under fire for obscuring the fact that Twitter was the source of things that eventually trended on Facebook. It seems unlikely that Twitter’s leadership would wreck its crown jewel, the conversations that only come about because of a live stream. Rather, adding in an algorithmic timeline as an option could be a good complement to that. A related concern is from those who fear an algorithmic stream means they wouldn’t see everything from the accounts they follow, similar to the way Facebook filters things. The idea is that Twitter shows everything. The reality is that Twitter’s current timeline does not. Yes, Twitter will show you everything from those you follow. But you only see all of that when you’re actually on Twitter — and no one watches Twitter 24 hours per day. There are things missed when you’re away, tweets you might actually want to see. A “DVR” version of Twitter as an option would be a nice way of providing this in addition to the live stream that people value. There’s also a mistaken assumption that by making such a change, Twitter would only show people stuff that advertisers have paid for. Twitter already does this in the live stream and has done so for ages. That’s called Promoted Tweets. In short, Twitter doesn’t need an algorithm timeline to insert ads. It can and does already do that with the existing live one. Swipe Right, Swipe Left: Solving Twitter’s Discovery Problem? Overall, done right and as an option, introducing an algorithmic timeline could be useful for those who want to see a “best of Twitter” view for the accounts they follow. It could also be useful for new people as a way to help them feel there’s great content on Twitter, if that’s an issue. The real challenge is whether people will use it. Twitter already has its Moments button, but its unclear how much that’s used. Would this be yet another thing that people might toggle to? Personally, I’d love to see Twitter adopt a more “swipe” approach to its app that I’m used to with Snapchat. Put my usual live timeline on my main screen. Let me swipe right to see the algorithmic “best of” personal timeline. Let me swipe again to see only images and photos from those I follow, giving me a sort of “Twittergram” take. Let me swipe further right to tap into more personal stuff, my likes, my messages and so on. To the left, let me discover things. Most important, let me swipe left to see what’s trending on Twitter. It’s terrible that the conversations that people are obsessed with remain hidden in the mobile app and only revealed if you click on search. Provide trends with their own screen. Let me swipe left again to reach Moments. I’m not saying these are a cure for Twitter’s woes. Actually, I don’t think Twitter is really that broken. I think there are things it can do to improve. But Twitter’s biggest problem really is investors that want to turn it into Facebook in terms of revenue. That leads to the biggest concern its users may have: that they don’t want the unique service they love fundamentally becoming more Facebook-like in the quest for that revenue. Postscript: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has now commented to reassure that live timelines are not going away.

Staff authors are listed here. ||||| Twitter’s got a new feature that will show you a bunch of recommended tweets at the top of your timeline, before your regular timeline. Nobody freak out. It’s chill. The new timeline shows you a series of tweets from people you follow before it shows you the real-time stream of tweets. How exactly it determines the mix isn’t clear but you can be sure it involves—wait for it!—an algorithm. It’s an opt-in feature that has to be switched on in your settings. In the blog post announcing the change, the company is very carful not to alarm sensitive users: Here’s how it works. You flip on the feature in your settings; then when you open Twitter after being away for a while, the Tweets you’re most likely to care about will appear at the top of your timeline – still recent and in reverse chronological order. The rest of the Tweets will be displayed right underneath, also in reverse chronological order, as always. At any point, just pull-to-refresh to see all new Tweets at the top in the live, up-to-the-second experience you already know and love. Advertisement Don’t worry everybody! It’s not that different! If you don’t like it, you don’t have to use it (for now), and even if you do use it, it’s easy to get rid of (for now). We should note that Twitter’s had a feature like this for some time—showing you popular tweets from people you follow when you open up the app. It’s not totally clear how this is different, but since Twitter is announcing it, it must be substantively so. A shitstorm erupted last weekend following reports that Twitter was planning on algorithmically reordering timelines a la Facebook. Company CEO Jack Dorsey quickly quashed the rumors that Twitter had any plans to reorder timelines—a least this week. Depending how you read this news, you might see him as a big liar. Advertisement Twitter’s in trouble. It’s not making a lot of money, and it’s not growing very fast, which are both bad news if you care about stock prices and all. We’ll know just how much when the company reports earnings today. But you can expect more change is coming to the beloved bird soon. [Twitter] Contact the author at maguilar@gizmodo.com. ||||| Today, Twitter rolled out arguably the most fundamental change it has ever made: a major tweak to the timeline. If you already use Twitter, you probably knew this was coming—#RIPTwitter and the Super Bowl were about the only things people talked about on the network this weekend. If you don't already use Twitter, well, Twitter hopes this might make you start. Either way, the feature's meant to dramatically increase the number of tweets you see that you actually care about. Twitter's own customer research found out there was a lot of FOMO going on. Everyone felt like they were missing all the good tweets. \\"We wanted to change that feeling of missing out,\\" says product manager Twitter product manager Michelle Haq, \\"which is why we decided to go after that problem.\\" Here's what's new—and before you freak out, know that this is not all bad and it's not the giant, Facebook-inspired overhaul you think it is. When you open Twitter after being away from Twitter for a bit, the first tweets at the top of your timeline won't necessarily be the latest ones. They'll be the tweets the service's algorithm determines most relevant to you, based on a variety of factors. Rather than show you the tweets from 10 seconds before you opened the app, it will now attempt to catch you up on the most important #content since you left. In most ways this is no different from the existing \\"While You Were Away\\" feature, except it won't be highlighted in any way. There's no limit to how many tweets will be out of order at the top, but Haq says the average is about a dozen. As for how often the catch-up feature will trigger? \\"This is going to vary by user,\\" Haq says. If you follow 1,000 accounts, and I follow 20 accounts... it might happen for you more often than it happens for me.\\" The new timeline's available for everyone today, but it's not turned on by default—yet. At some point in the next few weeks (the new feature's rolling out in waves), you'll get a pop-up notification in Twitter for Android, iOS, and web that says \\"Never miss an important tweet,\\" followed by some explanation about the new way your timeline is organized. From then on, your timeline will be presented the new, algorithmic way. Don't like it? Turn it off in settings. It's a rather simple update, though in fairness to detractors, it's yet other move away from what makes Twitter, Twitter. Initially, you might be slightly confused by the jumpy timestamps in your timeline, but as long as you pay a little attention you shouldn't get too lost. In the best-case scenario, the new timeline will serve up a greatest-hits compilation every time you open the app. No matter how much of a power a user you are, you're missing tweets—wouldn't it be nice to know you never missed a good one? In the worst case, it's a feckless mishmash of inanity, self-promotion, and lightly veiled #brandengagement. The truth will probably lie somewhere in the middle, and improve over time. Twitter has every incentive to make sure you're actually seeing good tweets and not just thirsty Taco Bell jokes. (Though that's half the reason Twitter's any fun.) The folks who are up in arms about the new feature are, broadly speaking, worried about what happens if your entire timeline becomes algorithmically powered the way Facebook is. In that world, you wouldn't and couldn't see every tweet; you'd never know why you were seeing what you were seeing, or if there were other, better things hidden from you. Facebook asks you to trust its ability to surface everything you want and need; Twitter's been a more understandable haven. It's certainly possible (though exceedingly unlikely) that Twitter could switch to a fully algorithmic timeline in the future, but this is not that. It will feel weird for a few days as you get used to the idea of Twitter as something other than a raw, unedited feed. But give it a few days, and it'll almost certainly feel like Twitter again. Just a little more useful now—at least, that's what Twitter's hoping. ||||| As expected, Twitter is tweaking its timeline to show users the best tweets from people they follow. But before you freak out, know that the algorithmic timeline is optional. If you activate it, the entries Twitter thinks you're most likely to care about will appear at the top of the timeline—still in reverse chronological order. The tweets Twitter deems less important will be displayed underneath, also in reverse chronological order. Just pull to refresh and new messages will appear at the top of your live feed. If you don't like it, revisit Settings to turn it off. \\"We've already seen that people who use this new feature tend to retweet and tweet more, creating more live commentary and conversations, which is great for everyone,\\" senior engineering manager Mike Jahr wrote in a blog post. Don't fret if you don't see the option just yet; Twitter's slow rollout will continue over the coming weeks. Users can expect a notification in their timeline once the function is available. But if you miss it, Twitter's support page has instructions for activating it on Twitter.com, iOS, and Android. Twitter tested a similar formula last year when it added a \\"While you were away\\" section to the top of timelines, highlighting a few of the best tweets that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. With this new system, though, it remains unclear how the social network will evaluate content and float the more compelling bits to the top. Will it be based on hearts and retweets? Interactions with other Twitter users? Rumors about an updated Twitter timeline emerged last week, and many users were not happy with the decision, resulting in the #RIPTwitter hashtag. ||||| Twitter has finally lifted the curtain on its long-teased rejig of the timeline. A new feature, dubbed “show me the best Tweets first”, will mix-up the Twitter timeline for the first time ever, putting the “most important” tweets from people you follow at the top of the timeline. The rest of the feed remains as normal, and scrolling to the top loads in tweets chronologically, as before. It’s a minor change, similar to the “While you were away” feature pushed out to users in the past year. But it is sure to prove controversial regardless. Initially, users will be able to opt-in to the feature, but eventually Twitter confirms that it will push it to everyone as the default setting. But don’t worry: you will still be able to turn it off. The company has provided instructions for how do so on its help pages. You can’t follow them pre-emptively, so bookmark this page for when the feature is rolled out to your phone, just in case the new feature isn’t to your taste. ||||| You follow hundreds of people on Twitter — maybe thousands — and when you open Twitter, it can feel like you’ve missed some of their most important Tweets.

Randy scooped up the selected spices in small pouches, making sure that their flavors would not mix. Step 6: Inquire about the shelf-life and storage of spices. Benjamin asked Randy about the best way to store the spices to retain their freshness and shelf-life. Randy explained that an airtight container placed in a cool, dry place would be ideal to maintain their potency and quality. Step 7: Purchase the spices and exchange contact information.

As a result, the rights related to freedom of expression, information, and the press are being debated to understand the best way to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital revolution, such as maintaining the integrity and quality of journalism, promoting diverse perspectives, and ensuring that accurate and reliable information reaches the public."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lindsey Caroline Vonn (nee Kildow ; born October 18, 1984) is an American World Cup alpine ski racer on the US Ski Team. She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). At the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, Vonn planned to compete in all five women's alpine events. On February 10, she revealed she had severely bruised her shin in training the previous week. Vonn said the pain from her injury was \\"excruciating\\" and she would have a difficult time competing at the Winter Olympics. Due to unseasonably warm weather and resultant poor snow conditions, many of the Alpine skiing events were moved back, giving Vonn additional time to heal. On February 17, in her first event, Vonn won the gold medal in the downhill at Whistler Blackcomb, beating longtime U.S. rival Julia Mancuso by 0.56 seconds and becoming the first American woman to win Olympic gold in downhill. In her second event, the super combined, Vonn finished first in the downhill portion of the race. In the slalom portion, however, she crashed when she failed to get her ski around a right-hand gate. Vonn said her shin wasn't the problem. Gold and silver were won by Maria Riesch and Julia Mancuso respectively. In her third event, the super-G, Vonn finished third behind Andrea Fischbacher and Tina Maze, 0.74 seconds behind Fischbacher's winning time. Afterwards, Vonn said she didn't ski the last part of the course as aggressively as she could have and lost the race as a result. In her fourth event, the giant slalom, fog affected visibility. Vonn crashed in her first run, resulting in a broken fourth finger and Vonn's disqualification from the event. In her fifth event, the slalom, Vonn lost control and straddled a gate, disqualifying her from the event.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what happened in 2010?","completion":"In 2010, at the Vancouver Winter Olympics, Lindsey Vonn won the gold medal in the downhill event, becoming the first American woman to achieve this.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Joana Ortega i Alemany was born on November 13, 1959, in the vibrant city of Barcelona, Spain. She pursued her higher education at the Abat Oliba CEU University, which is a prestigious private university located in Catalonia, Spain. Joana showed great promise in her academic endeavors and was destined to make significant contributions to the political sphere in her home region. Ortega's political aspirations led her to join the Democratic Union of Catalonia – a center-right political party in the autonomous community of Catalonia. As a member of this party, she was associated with its parent organization, the Convergence and Union (CiU) – a center-right Catalan nationalist electoral coalition active in the same region. Her dedicated work in the political landscape caught the eye of the then-president of Catalonia, Artur Mas, who held office from December 29, 2010, until June 22, 2015. Recognizing her potential, Mas appointed Joana Ortega as the Vice President of Catalonia, a position in which she would not only be responsible for external relations and communication but also act as his second-in-command. Concurrently, Ortega was entrusted with another important portfolio as the Minister of Governance and Institutional Relations. As Vice President and Minister, Joana Ortega was responsible for promoting the image and interests of Catalonia both nationally and internationally. She played a crucial role in the development and implementation of public policies and was involved in the coordination of ministries while ensuring that institutional relations and governance structures in the region were functioning efficiently. Her term as Vice President and Minister of Governance and Institutional Relations ended on June 22, 2015. Joana Ortega's successors to these positions were Neus Munté i Fernández and Meritxell Borràs i Solé, respectively. Prior to her tenure as Vice President, Joana Ortega had held other significant political positions in Catalonia, including serving as the successor to both Josep-Lluís Carod-Rovira and Jordi Ausàs i Coll. Her experiences in these roles enabled her to contribute effectively to her subsequent roles in the Catalan government. Although the bullet points provide only a brief overview of the life of Joana Ortega i Alemany, they give us a picture of a strong, dedicated, and influential political figure in Catalonia.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Living End are an Australian punk rock band, which formed in 1994. Since 2002 the line up consists of Chris Cheney (vocals, guitar), Scott Owen (double bass, vocals) and Andy Strachan (drums). The band rose to fame in 1997 after the release of their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. They have released six studio albums and two reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: self-titled album (12 October 1998) and State of Emergency (4 February 2006). The Living End were formed in 1994 by Chris Cheney and Scott Owen, who had met years earlier in primary school through their older sisters and began performing together from 1990 while attending Wheelers Hill Secondary College in Melbourne. Cheney and Owen had their first public gig at The Rob Roy in Melbourne in 1991. Cheney was a fan of rockabilly group Stray Cats and this prompted Owen, who originally played piano, to switch to double bass. The pair formed a cover band, The Runaway Boys, which performed Stray Cats and The Clash material. That group were named after a track, of the same name, from the Stray Cats self-titled debut album (February 1981). The Runaway Boys initially played in the local rockabilly music scene but expanded their audience by performing in regional towns. Cheney later recalled \\"[w]e played to all the jivers and rock 'n' rollers ... And we slowly drifted into Melbourne's rockabilly scene\\". As Cheney and Owen persevered, the band went through several drummers, while they were still attending school. By 1994 Cheney and Owen were writing their own material and decided to change the band's name to The Living End - a reference to the film, Rock Around the Clock (1956). According to Cheney \\"It's an old '50s term, meaning 'far out', 'the greatest' ... We were still into the whole '50s thing, but we wanted a neutral name, one that didn't suggest any one style of music\\". With Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Owen on double bass and backing vocals, the group settled on Joe Piripitzi as their drummer. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance. During that year they recorded a track, \\"Headlines\\", which had been co-written by Cheney and Owen. The group sent a T-shirt and demo tape to Green Day guitarist and lead vocalist, Billie Joe Armstrong, and landed a support slot for the 1995 Australian tour by his band, Green Day. After that tour, The Living End recorded additional tracks for their debut extended play, Hellbound, which received moderate support from community radio stations. It was produced by the group and included \\"Headlines\\" from the previous year. Ed Nimmervoll, an Australian musicologist, described the EP's sound: \\"they turned their back on '50s rock revivalism and adapted that instrumentation to original songs steeped in UK punk\\". In November 1995, the trio recorded their second EP, It's for Your Own Good, which appeared in the following June. The six-track EP was co-produced by Lindsay Gravina (Underground Lovers, Cosmic Psychos), Mike Alonso (Jericho) and The Living End for the Rapido label. It included their first radio airplay hit, \\"From Here on In\\", which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio network, Triple J. Shortly after, Piripitzi was fired as his lifestyle choices were holding back the band. He was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey (later in The Knockout Drops). With Demsey the group appeared at major festivals: Pushover and the Falls Festival. Demsey's drum style was compared with The Who's Keith Moon. \\"From Here on In\\" was used on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, Occasional Course Language. The Living End toured Australia for a year, then in August 1997 they recorded new material to sell at their live shows. Their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", was issued in January the following year. Also that month they had supported The Offspring on the Australian leg of their tour. \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\" peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and was certified double-platinum by ARIA for shipment of 140,000 copies. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 it won the Highest Selling Single category; and eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the 1990s. It lasted a record-breaking 47 weeks in the Top 50. In October 1998 it peaked at No. 28 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It was later featured in the game, Guitar Hero World Tour. \\"Second Solution\\" was used in the soundtrack for the 2002 movie, Cheats, which starred Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, and Mary Tyler Moore. Early in 1998 \\"Prisoner of Society\\" was issued as a separate single in the United Kingdom and, the following year, in the US. The single appeared in the top 200 of the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard's Alternative Songs Chart. The band signed with Modular Recordings for the release of their debut self-titled album, which appeared on 12 October 1998, and was co-produced by Gravina with the trio. It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, became the then-second highest-selling debut rock album in Australian music history and, by 1999, was certified 4x Platinum for shipment of 280,000 units. Their next Australian single, \\"Save the Day\\", was issued in September 1998, a month ahead of the album. It made the top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It became their highest charting hit on the New Zealand Singles Chart, where it reached No. 10. From the album, a total of six singles were released including a live cover version of \\"Tainted Love\\", which was issued as a radio-only single on Triple J. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999, The Living End won two more awards: Best Group and Breakthrough Artist - Album. At the ceremony they were also nominated for Album of the Year and Highest Selling Album. In October 2010 their debut album was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. The Living End's second album, Roll On, was recorded during July 2000 with Nick Launay (Midnight Oil, Models, Silverchair) producing and appeared in November that year. It peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart and reached the top 40 in New Zealand. Although Roll On was a more creative work, Nimmervoll mentioned that they had \\"broadened their musical scope while keeping in tact what made them unique - the instrumentation and the socially-aware lyrics\\". The album did not achieve the status of their earlier album as it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 copies. Despite this, fans consider it to be as strong as the self-titled album; \\"[it's] an absolute scorcher! That's what years of live honing can do for a band that was already white-hot\\". Cheney later stated that he was trying to prove to critics that The Living End were not a band simply defined by their hit, \\"Prisoner of Society\\", and the album showed this by displaying other influences, as well as their traditional fast-paced rockabilly music. Rolling Stone' Jenny Eiscu compared it to The Clash's creative breakthrough, London Calling (December 1979), as they \\"stomp all over the boundaries between punk, reggae, rockabilly and plain old rock & roll - and it still sounds like a revelation, twenty-two years after [T]he Clash did it. The pupils don't quite outpace the masters here ... But the band is obviously having such a riotously good time that you'd be a sucker not to stomp your foot and join the party\\". Much of the style was comparable to 1980s hard rock and pub rock, as well as many tracks being obscure mixes of many ideas, resulting in 'procrastinating' structures. This defined the album's creativity. The album's first two singles, \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" and the title track, peaked into the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" also reached the top 20 in New Zealand, while \\"Roll On\\" peaked at No. 33 on the Billboard Alternative Songs Chart, and appeared in the top 150 of the UK Singles Chart. In March 2001 Billboard's review of Roll On described their sound as \\"Aussie punkabilly\\", while the group's lyrics show a \\"socially progressive attitude, discussing prejudice, racism, and political conflict\\". The trio received US-wide coverage by playing on both Conan O'Brien's and David Letterman's late-night variety shows. The album included \\"Carry me Home\\", which appeared on the Guitar Hero II soundtrack. However, touring in support of Roll On and the related singles was halted after Cheney had a car accident on the Great Ocean Road, rendering him unable to play for a significant period of time: he was \\"hospitalised for 2 months\\". He had been on travelling to the house of a member of fellow Australian band and tour mates, Bodyjar. Did they win any awards?","completion":"Yes, The Living End won awards.

The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later.

Pacino feels like a bankable source to disguise mediocrity but a dud is a dud and Avnet is wholly indifferent 3. At times it's almost like Pacino has been lured into a Bobby Bowfinger production except the best blackmail material around to get his permission for release is 88 Minutes itself. 4. The only mystery here is why Pacino would have chosen to lend his talents to a project of an artistic level that most people would more readily associate with the likes of Michael Pare about ten years ago or Robert De Niro today. 5. If only the film actually ran 88 minutes instead of 108, the many glaring logic loopholes might have whizzed by without notice. But like a bad apple, that extra 20 minutes of wasted film has rotted the rest. 6. A skilled director could take the same exact script from 88 Minutes, change maybe three or four lines, and shoot it as a spoof movie. It's that close to self-parody. 7. While the actual ending does give audiences a reason to cheer, it's the final fade out that will make viewers the happiest. It means this tepid terror is finally over. 8. ...it is mildly entertaining to see Pacino in a role where he has obviously been encouraged to turn it up, to become a wild-eyed, roaring self-parody 9.

The incident occurred at about 5 p.m. when a man walked onto the train, which was stopped in the station at Samalut, about 200 kilometers south of Cairo, said Maryanne Nabil Thaki, 29, one of the victims. She said she was seated with her sister, Maggie Nabil Thaki, 25, their 52-year-old mother, Sabah Sinot Suleiman, and Maggie's fiance, 26-year-old Ehab Ashraf Kamal. They were en route to Cairo to buy an engagement ring, Maggie Thaki said. Seated near them was an older Christian couple, Maryanne Nabil Thaki said. The gunman walked up and down the length of the train, then walked back to two groups of people who were seated near each other and were both Coptic Christians, she told a reporter at the Good Shepherd Hospital in Samalut, where she was being treated for gunshot wounds to the leg and the chest. The man said in Arabic, \\"There is no God but God,\\" and opened fire, she said. The shooter fled the train, but was captured later, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said. The suspect, a deputy policeman, was identified as Amer Ashoor Abdel-Zaher Hassan. He boarded the train in Asiut and was en route to Bani Mazar, Menya province, where he works. The older man, Fathi Saeed Ebaid, 71, of Cairo, was killed, a local security source told the state-run Egyptian news agency MENA. His wife, Emily Hannah Tedly, 61, was in critical condition, as was the mother of the two younger women, said Dr. Petra Kamal. All five were to be flown to Cairo for further treatment, a hospital employee said. In front of the hospital, about a dozen Copts demonstrated in support of the victims but were dispersed by police who fired a tear gas canister that broke through a fifth-floor hospital window, said hospital employee Mina Farouk. The attack comes 10 days after a bombing killed 23 Coptic Christians outside the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria, Egypt, an attack that unnerved Christians and led to increased security. Relations between the Christian minority and Muslim majority within Egypt have been tense since that New Year's Day bombing. Those troubles were evident last Friday -- the day Coptic Christians, who follow the Julian calendar, celebrate Christmas -- when police staged a large-scale security operation outside the same church. In a show of solidarity, some Egyptian Muslims attended the Christmas services. Still, protests have erupted almost nightly in many Christian areas of Egypt since the bombing. Egyptian authorities have released a sketch of a man they think was the suicide bomber in the church attack. The Interior Ministry used forensic technology to re-create the face. About 9 percent of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion is known for its rift with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Housam Ahmed and Amir Ahmed and Journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Suicide for the following movie plot: The movie begins with frank, humorous interviews of two men who set out to kill themselves and then moves into a Day Of The Dead celebration where the guests celebrate the lives of those whom they have lost. Director Stutz questions his family about his mother's suicide in 1979 and how little they've actually discussed it, visiting his mother's grave site with his sister and listening to old tapes of their mother. He talks to several survivors and experts before commissioning several artists to come up with works about suicide: A band (The Bigfellas) agrees to make a song about suicide \\"that you can dance to\\"; an illustrator (Patrick Horvath) is to make short animated films (which run through the documentary as interstitials); a choreographer (Danielle Peig) chooses to create a dance piece based on two autopsy reports; and a standup comedian (Duncan Trussell) compiles material for his act about suicide with the help of several top comedy writers. Meanwhile, Stutz continues to interview and engage his family about his mother's death, eventually staging his mother's suicide (where he discovered her unconscious at the age of 12) on screen with members of the \\"avant-garde circus\\" troupe, The Lucent Dossier Experience. As some of the interviews take a turn from the dark to the more cathartic, the tone of the movie brightens at the end during the performances of the artistic material. The interview subjects give positive, inspiring messages to the audience about things they can actively do to help prevent suicides and connect more deeply with those they love. The movie closes with images of another ceremony at the ocean which bookends the Day Of The Dead images from the beginning of the film.

The doctor had done his best but no medicine really worked. The only chance to save her seemed to be a blood transfusion from her five-year-old brother. The little boy had the same disease before and had developed the antibodies to fight the illness. The doctor talked to the little boy about what they planned to do, and asked him if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for a moment. He took a deep breath and said, \\"Yes, I'll do it if it can save Lisa.\\" As the transfusion was going on, the little boy lay quietly in bed next to his sister. He looked at her and smiled all the time. When everything was done and the colour returned to his sister's face, his smile disappeared and he looked a little afraid.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: If you look at the night sky, you'll often see stars moving very quickly. In fact, they move much more quickly than they should according to their size and the laws of physics. Scientists do not completely understand why the speed of these stars is so high. But many believe the reason is that much of the universe is made of something called \\"dark matter\\". Groups of stars called galaxies, such as the Milky Way, might even be made up of 90 percent dark matter. How much something weighs depends on where it is. The same object weighs only half as much on Mars as it does on Earth and almost three times as much on Jupiter. So scientists prefer to talk about the mass of something rather than how much it weighs, because mass does not change. They can work out the mass of galaxies by measuring the distance between them and the speed they move at. Recently, Jorge Penarrubia, a senior academic at Edinburgh University, UK, and his team discovered something interesting: The mass of the Milky Way is only half as much as the mass of another nearby galaxy, Andromeda. This seems strange, and dark matter may explain why. Finding out more about dark matter could help us understand how the universe began, but this is not easy. Lots of scientists with different types of expert knowledge are working on the problem. We can't see dark matter, it's very difficult to measure and we can't find out its mass. Unlike stars, dark matter doesn't produce or reflect light. But we can make a good guess that it is there because of the way things move and the way light bends. Experts now think dark matter may be very different from the matter that we find on Earth. There may also be five times as much dark matter in the universe as ordinary matter.

The Chinese mob boss, Lee, approaches Frank with a desperate plea. His daughter, Lai, a prominent human rights activist, has been kidnapped, and he says Frank is the only one he trusts to find her discreetly. Frank dives into the mystery headfirst, discovering layers of corruption, betrayal, and danger as he navigates the shadowy underbelly of San Francisco's Chinatown. As he delves deeper into Lai's background, he uncovers her secret fight against the human trafficking ring perpetrated by her family's organization. He starts to suspect that perhaps Lee is not as desperate to find his daughter as he initially seems. Unexpectedly, Frank is arrested for Lai's kidnapping by the local authorities, now manipulated by Lee, intending to silence him permanently. The plot thickens as it becomes evident to Frank that Lee set him up from the beginning, making him the scapegoat. Frank now stands accused of the crime he is trying to solve. While in jail, Frank receives an anonymous tip about Lai's possible location. He convinces his prison cellmate, a notorious computer hacker named Tim, to help him escape and find Lai. The escape plan is successful, and Frank and Tim set on a high-octane chase across the city to uncover the truth and rescue Lai. In a dramatic showdown, Frank manages to save Lai, exposes Lee’s double-dealing, and proves his innocence. The movie ends with Frank and a reformed Tim starting a new investigation agency together, fighting against crime, and making the city a safer place.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the artist who's greatest hits album did the lead singer of the band that tried to \\"remain somewhat grungy\\" give to the man that added layers of guitars to songs? from the following article ? Recording sessions for the album began on October 31, 1988, at Downtown Recorders in Boston, Massachusetts, at the time a professional 24-track studio. 4AD allowed the Pixies a budget of 40,000, excluding producer's fees. This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including gated reverb to the mix. The master tapes were then sent for final post-production later that month.","completion":"The full name of the artist whose greatest hits album was given by the lead singer of the band (the Pixies) that tried to \\"remain somewhat grungy\\" to the man (producer Gary Norton) who added layers of guitars to songs is Charles Hardin Holley, better known as Buddy Holly. The lead singer of the Pixies, Black Francis (real name Charles Thompson), handed Norton a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits as an example of how a song can be good and impactful without being overly long or commercialized. The Pixies were trying to maintain their signature grungy sound during the recording of their album, and Francis used Buddy Holly as an inspiration and proof that it was possible to create meaningful music without excessive commercialization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to once in a blue moon origin of phrase??","completion":"The phrase \\"once in a blue moon\\" refers to an event or occurrence that is extremely rare. The idiom originates from the astronomical phenomenon of a \\"blue moon.\\" Before delving into the origin and history of the expression, it is essential to understand the meaning and significance behind a blue moon itself. The term \\"blue moon\\" is used to describe the second full moon that takes place within a single calendar month. To be clear, the moon does not actually turn blue. The color blue has no scientific connection to the event, and the term is simply a metaphor. It would typically require extraordinarily rare conditions, such as the presence of volcanic ash or large forest fires, for the moon to appear blue. Interestingly, there are other occasions when the term is used for different moon-related phenomena; however, the phrase \\"once in a blue moon\\" is etymologically tied to the aforementioned phenomenon of having two full moons in a single month. Full moons usually occur nearly every 29.5 days, which is approximately the length of one lunar cycle. Given that most months in the Gregorian calendar have 30 or 31 days, the possibility of witnessing two full moons in a single month arises occasionally. This phenomenon only happens, on average, once every 2.7 years, thus making it an infrequent event and leading to the birth of the expression \\"once in a blue moon.\\" The history of the phrase can be traced back to English literature from the 16th century. The first known recorded use of the term \\"blue moon\\" appeared in a pamphlet from 1528, titled \\"Rede Me and Be Not Wrothe,\\" authored by William Roy and Jeremy Barlowe. In this early usage, the term was not employed to describe an astronomical event but instead to exemplify the absurdity – akin to saying, \\"when pigs fly.\\" However, it is important to note that the connection between these early instances and the current idiomatic meaning is quite weak and not well-documented. The phrase continued to evolve, and by the 19th century, it began to gain momentum and solidify its connection to rare lunar phenomena. In 1821, an article in The London Literary Gazette used the phrase to describe a rare event. The term became increasingly popular over time and established its correlation with the infrequent occurrence of two full moons within a single calendar month. In more recent times, a publication called Sky & Telescope played a pivotal role in popularizing the phrase, albeit unintentionally. In an article from 1946, the author, James Hugh Pruett, misunderstood a definition within the 1937 edition of the Maine Farmers' Almanac. Pruett's misinterpretation led to the introduction of the \\"Blue Moon Rule,\\" equating a blue moon to the second full moon within a single month. This article ultimately helped cement and propagate the modern understanding of a blue moon and subsequently, the origin of the phrase \\"once in a blue moon.\\" In summary, the idiom \\"once in a blue moon\\" signifies an event that happens very rarely. The expression has historical ties to rare lunar events and evolved over time, particularly due to a 1946 article that popularized Pruett's \\"Blue Moon Rule.\\" Today, the term is used to describe any exceedingly uncommon occurrence or special event that only happens every few years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A retired diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to get revenge on the Russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. I remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous U.S. government. It's interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero. Not a great flick, it's really typically a \\"B\\" action flick. Michael York lends some class to this mediocre movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop is kind of \\"blah\\" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York.

Disappointingly, the handsome Adrian Paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an above average \\"B\\" action flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical bad guy.

She knew that Megan loved flowers, and the most beautiful flowers that Monica could think of were orchids. So, she decided to get a bouquet of orchids for Megan as a special birthday gift. On the day of Megan's birthday, Monica woke up early and went to the flower shop near their home. She picked out the most colorful and fragrant orchids she could find. The florist carefully arranged the flowers into a lovely bouquet and wrapped it in pretty paper. Monica thanked the florist with a big smile and carried the bouquet back to her house. When she got home, Monica carefully hid the orchid bouquet in her room so Megan wouldn't see it before the party. As their friends and family began to arrive, everyone gathered in the backyard to celebrate Megan's special day. Once everyone had arrived, Monica knew it was time to surprise Megan with the orchids. She went to her room and gently picked up the bouquet, making sure not to squish any of the delicate flowers. Monica walked out into the backyard with the orchids hidden behind her back. When Megan saw Monica approaching, she had a curious look on her face. Monica could tell that she was eager to know what was being hidden behind her back. As soon as everyone's attention turned towards Monica, she revealed the orchid bouquet with a big smile and said, \\"Surprise! Happy Birthday, Megan!\\" Megan's eyes sparkled with delight as she looked at the orchids. She held her hands to her face and giggled with excitement. \\"Oh, Monica! They're beautiful! I love orchids so much! Thank you!\\" Megan exclaimed. She gave Monica a big hug, filled with gratitude and joy.

At a forum for young people, Mrs Merkel tells the Palestinian girl, Reem, that not all migrants can stay in Germany and \\"some will have to go home\\". Mrs Merkel then strokes Reem, who is now crying, on the back. Reem had said she and her family had been waiting four years to gain permanent residency in Germany.

Some social media users complained that Mrs Merkel had \\"petted\\" the girl and failed to show enough sensitivity, although others defended the leader's reaction. In the video, Reem tells Mrs Merkel that her family was told they would have to return to a camp in Lebanon imminently - only to receive a last-minute temporary German residency permit. \\"I would like to go to university,\\" says Reem, in fluent German. \\"It's really very hard to watch how other people can enjoy life and you yourself can't.

Please write a short summary for the following article: King’s Absence at Meeting Signals a Saudi-U.S. Marriage Adrift For Mr. Obama, a diplomatic agreement with Iran curbing its nuclear program offers the strongest chance of keeping conflict in the region from escalating. For the Sunni-led Saudi government, the relaxation of sanctions in the proposed deal would simply give Iran, a predominantly Shiite state, billions of dollars to foment more instability around the region. While the Americans and the Saudis are now cooperating to fight the Islamic State, Riyadh wants more action to force out the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, while Mr. Obama has been reluctant to intervene. Similarly, while Mr. Obama has portrayed the drive for greater democracy in the region as a force for good, the Saudis see the still simmering Arab Spring movement as a threat to their hold on power. In the midst of all that, the politics of energy have shifted along with the surge in oil production in North Dakota and Texas. No longer so dependent on foreign crude, the United States can flex muscles without worrying about the Saudis cutting its energy supply. Yet Washington still relies on Riyadh to keep the price of oil low to pressure Russia’s energy-based economy in the standoff over Ukraine. Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama, said that differences were to be expected between two countries with varied interests but that those did not undermine the broader relationship. “We have a very robust agenda that we share with the Saudis,” he said. “There have been disagreements under this administration and under the previous administration about certain policies and development in the Middle East, but I think on a set of core interests, we continue to have a common view about what we aim to achieve.” But experts said the United States had little desire to be drawn more deeply into the dangerous proxy war between Iran and the Sunni states playing out in places like Yemen. “The United States is not interested in overindulging in other issues that the gulf states are worried about,” said Marwan Muasher, a Jordanian former foreign minister. “Are the gulf states going to go back from this meeting feeling reassured? I would say the answer is no.” Presidents have labored to stay close to Saudi Arabia for decades, but have sometimes run into turbulence. Ronald Reagan sold the Saudis sophisticated Awacs airplanes over the objections of Israel. George Bush sent 500,000 troops to defend Saudi Arabia and reverse Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. His son George W. Bush shared plans in advance with eager Saudis for his own invasion of Iraq. But King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who died in January, was once so upset with the younger Mr. Bush about his support for Israel that the king threatened to storm out of a visit to the president’s Texas ranch. The Saudis also frustrated Mr. Bush by refusing to work closely with the Shiite-led Iraqi government as it fought Sunni insurgents. Over the years, administrations have worried about Saudi money that has financed extremist groups. Mr. Obama, who ripped up his schedule to fly to Riyadh in January to pay respects to King Salman when he took power, spoke with the king by telephone on Monday. The White House had announced Friday that King Salman would attend the meeting, but was blindsided over the weekend when the Saudis said they would instead send Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Saudis said the king needed to stay in Riyadh because of the kingdom’s air campaign against Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen. Some regional experts said that at age 79, he has not traveled much out of the country. But some Arab officials said his decision not to attend reflected a broader disappointment that Mr. Obama would not be offering much concrete security assistance at the meeting. The king was not the only one to turn down Mr. Obama’s invitation. The leaders of Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates — some of whom are in ill health — will also skip the meeting, sending subordinates instead. Critics said the list of attendees revealed Mr. Obama’s inability to shape events in the region. “It’s an indicator of the lack of confidence that the Saudis and others have,” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, told MSNBC. He blamed Secretary of State John Kerry for misreading Saudi signals. “He sometimes interprets things as he wants them to be rather than what they really are,” Mr. McCain said. The Obama administration said it had rejected a mutual defense treaty sought by the gulf states several weeks ago. The foreign ministers of those countries, however, raised no major protests to Mr. Kerry when he met with them in Paris on Friday in advance of this week’s summit meeting. “There was no hint of dissatisfaction,” said Robert Malley, the president’s top Middle East adviser. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, insisted on Monday that no slight was intended by the king’s last-minute decision to skip the summit meeting. “The idea that this is a snub because the king did not attend is really off base,” he told reporters in Washington. “The fact that our crown prince and deputy crown prince attend an event outside of Saudi Arabia at the same time is unprecedented.” White House aides said the Saudi princes were the important ones to deal with on these issues. But the president, who will host a dinner at the White House on Wednesday night and then a day of meetings at Camp David on Thursday, will be left with few prospects for a major breakthrough. Tamara Cofman Wittes, a former deputy assistant secretary of state under Mr. Obama, said: “If anybody had the idea that the summit, in the midst of everything that’s going on, was going to somehow be a neatly wrapped little package that would conclude everything, they were kidding themselves.” A version of this news analysis appears in print on May 12, 2015, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Absent King Signals Saudi-U.S. Marriage Adrift.

First, let's examine the statement \\"he felt Tuppence was noble\\" from Sentence 2. As stated in Sentence 1, \\"He now felt that Tuppence was all that was noble and disinterested.\\" This implies that the person does indeed feel that Tuppence is noble.

Kemp and Sala immediately go on a drinking binge, which earns Kemp the enmity of his editor, Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). Kemp also meets Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi), a deadbeat reporter who can't be fired. While waiting for an interview, Kemp meets Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a freelance realtor, who offers him a job writing ads for his latest venture. Sanderson is engaged to Chenault, who pretends not to know Kemp. Later, Kemp moves in with Sala, who also rooms with Moburg. Kemp begins to see the poverty of San Juan, but Lotterman doesn't want him to write about it, as it's bad for tourism. Moburg returns with leftover filters from a rum plant; they contain high-proof alcohol. Moburg has been fired, and rants about killing Lotterman. Kemp visits Sanderson and spies him making love to Chenault. He meets Zimburger (Bill Smitrovich) and Segarra (Amaury Nolasco), who want him to help with a real estate scam. Later, Sala and Kemp go to a restaurant and berate the owner for refusing them service; Kemp senses that the owner wants to kill them, and he and Sala beat a hasty retreat, pursued by angry locals. The police arrive and break up the fight, then throw Sala and Kemp in jail. Sanderson bails them out. The next day, Kemp meets with Sanderson's crew, who tell him that the US military is relinquishing the lease on some prime real estate, and is asked to pick up Chenault from her house.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

In this situation, you had two middle pair and a flush draw.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Once your partner admits cheating or you discover it, talk about the situation. As this is a volatile issue, you might consider hashing out the affair with the help of a family and marriage therapist, clergy person, or psychologist. Your therapist can help you learn effective communication techniques. Learning more about the incident will remove some of the mystery – if you don't know what happened, you may obsess over what may have happened. Until you can begin to make sense of what happened, you cannot begin to rebuild the relationship, if you decide that's what you want. In every case, try to learn: Why the cheating occurred With whom it occurred How often it happened Although it can be hard to broach this topic, you need to know and decide what lies ahead. Whether or not you stay with your partner depends on many factors: your feelings, the legality of your relationship, the duration of your relationship, children, etc. If you are open to reconciliation, discuss what that will take. For example, you might consider going to regular couples therapy. You could opt for a temporary separation. Whether this is your partner’s first time cheating or he/she cheated multiple times with many partners, it is important that he/she also receive individual counseling. You can ask your doctor for a recommendation. Psychologists and family and marriage therapists work with these cases. Religious clergy also often perform counseling. Make sure the therapist you choose specializes in relationships and/or infidelity. See Overcome Sexual Addiction for additional tips. Your partner has broken your trust and violated your relationship. You are not responsible for your partner’s behavior. Even if you feel you could have been a better boyfriend, wife, etc., your partner still made the decision to cheat. Some reasons and situations that influence why people cheat include: The person is unable to make himself happy and seeks external things to validate him and make him happy. High levels of conflict or dissimilarity in couples. The person works in an environment that involves a great deal of touching, intimate discussion, or one-on-one time.","completion":"The discovery or admission of a partner cheating can have severe impacts on a relationship, and it is essential to have an open and honest discussion about the situation. There are numerous factors to explore, and engaging the help of professionals such as family and marriage therapists, clergy, or psychologists can be highly beneficial in navigating the emotional turmoil that may arise. One crucial step is learning more about the affair to eliminate the unknowns and reduce the chances of obsessing over the events. Gaining insights into the reasons behind the cheating, the people involved, and the frequency of the incidents will help understand the whole picture and make decisions about the future. These aspects will allow for a better assessment of whether reconciliation is a viable option considering factors like personal feelings, the legal status of the relationship, the length of the relationship, and any children involved. If the choice is to try and rebuild the relationship, discussing plans for reconciliation is vital. Regular couples therapy may be beneficial, and in some cases, a temporary separation could be necessary. It is also essential for the cheating partner to receive individual counseling, regardless of whether the infidelity was a one-time occurrence or part of a pattern. Professional help can be sought through psychologists, family and marriage therapists, or religious clergy who specialize in relationship and infidelity issues. Additional support and information can be found by referring to resources on overcoming sexual addiction. It's crucial to remember that the partner who cheated ultimately made the decision to do so, regardless of any potential shortcomings in the relationship. While there may be various reasons and situations that contribute to infidelity, such as a person's inability to find happiness within themselves, high levels of conflict, or a job environment that encourages intimate interactions, the responsibility lies with the individual who made the choice to cheat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: It's no secret that hair will grow just where you don't want it. If you have unwanted hair that shows around your bikini in the back, try waxing or shaving to remove it. You can also use a hair removal cream to remove unwanted hair, but be sure to test it on a small patch of skin first to see if it irritates your skin. Use a gentle all over scrub in the shower to help remove dead skin. Removing dead skin will make your skin feel softer and appear smoother. Use a tanning lotion or cream to give your skin that sun-kissed look without actually using the sun or a tanning bed. Simply use a mirror to apply the cream evenly to your body, making sure to go lightly on problem areas such as your knees, elbows, and face. Make sure you try on your bathing suit before tanning to ensure you cover all the skin that's showing, including the area around your butt. For a glamorous-looking tan, try products like Shiseido Brilliant Bronze Tinted Self Tanning Gel or Clarins Intense Bronze Self Tanning Tint, both of which were rated highly by Total Beauty. Be warned, though, they can be a little pricey. The best tanning creams today don't use a dye or stain. Rather, they use DHA to actually change the color of your skin. Use a moisturizing lotion when you get out of the shower or before bedtime to keep your skin healthy and looking smooth. Not everyone looks good in the same bikini, so pick the right one for your body. If you curve at your hips and thighs, opt for a bikini with a high cut, as other bikinis may cut you off strangely. In addition, this cut will add visual inches to your legs, making them appear longer. Try a string bikini, as it can accommodate your curves. If your problem area is your stomach, opt for boy shorts with stomach control. Not only will it slim down your stomach, the suit will highlight you summer-ready bikini butt. If you are larger in your butt and thighs, try a bikini with ruffles and a small skirt. A small skirt can help hide problem areas, and ruffles add length, meaning you can adjust it up or down as needed. If you're athletic, try a string bikini. String bikinis add less bulk to your already muscular body. Avoid shiny materials. Shiny material will show every bump on your body, highlighting problem areas. Opt for solid bikinis in cool colors instead. Salt can make you bloated, which can make everything look bigger in a bikini. Use herbs instead of salt at meals, and check menus for low-sodium options. Also, always read labels, as many products have added salt. Using correct posture will help your whole body look better, as it lifts up problem areas and pulls the skin tighter. You may not have the exact bikini butt you want, but that shouldn't stop you from splashing in the waves or jumping in the pool with your best girlfriends.

They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape. In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands, nearly bankrupting himself. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius. Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto.

This can give rise to the situation in which two dialects (defined according to this paradigm) with a somewhat distant genetic relationship are mutually more readily comprehensible than more closely related dialects. In one opinion, this pattern is clearly present among the modern Romance languages, with Italian and Spanish having a high degree of mutual comprehensibility, which neither language shares with French, despite some claiming that both languages are genetically closer to French than to each other:[citation needed] In fact, French-Italian and French-Spanish relative mutual incomprehensibility is due to French having undergone more rapid and more pervasive phonological change than have Spanish and Italian, not to real or imagined distance in genetic relationship. In fact, Italian and French share many more root words in common that do not even appear in Spanish. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): With what romance language does Spanish not have a high degree of mutual comprehensibility?","completion":"The Romance language with which Spanish does not have a high degree of mutual comprehensibility is French. Spanish and Italian reportedly have a high degree of mutual comprehensibility, meaning speakers of these two languages can relatively easily understand each other's language, even if they don't have formal training in that language. However, despite Spanish and French both being Romance languages—and therefore sharing a common ancestral language in Latin—they do not share this high level of mutual comprehensibility. There are several reasons for this, but one of the main factors is that French has undergone extensive phonological changes that drastically differentiate it from the other Romance languages. Phonology refers to the systematic organization of sounds in languages. These transformations in French have greatly affected the verbal and phonetic system, making it harder for non-French speakers to understand. Another factor complicating mutual comprehensibility between French and Spanish is the influence of other languages on French. For instance, the invasion of the Franks, a Germanic tribe, in the historical region of Gaul (now modern-day France) led to substantial lexical and phonetic influences from the Germanic languages on Old French. Also, it is worth mentioning that while Spanish and Italian may be closer in terms of mutual comprehensibility, certain linguistic features make each Romance language distinctive and can create barriers to understanding. For instance, vocabulary, syntax, and usage can all be factors that hinder mutual intelligibility, even within the same language family, due to the phenomenon of language divergence over time, geographical isolation, as well as historical and cultural influences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We can break it down into two parts: 1. \\"A man attached to strings\\": This suggests that the man is being controlled or manipulated in some way. It could be a metaphorical statement referring to outside forces that control the man in social, political, or artistic contexts. Alternatively, it could be a literal statement that the man is physically attached to strings, such as in a marionette performance or an acrobatic act. 2. \\"is watched by a crowd\\": This implies that the man's presence and actions are being observed by multiple people. It's likely that the man is in a public space or has drawn attention to himself. However, the original statement does not mention a stage or a performance explicitly. It's possible that a stage is involved, but it could also be an impromptu or informal performance, a street act, or even an unintentional spectacle (like a protest). It could also be possible that the man is not performing at all – he might be in an exhibit or a social experiment. It is important to note that making assumptions without proper context can lead to a misunderstanding of the situation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Rape case puts focus on elite prep school's alleged sexual tradition St Paul’s School in New Hampshire boasts a glittering roster of alumni that includes senators, congressmen, a Nobel laureate and the current US secretary of state. The elite prep school also allegedly has a sordid tradition of sexual conquest where graduating boys try to take the virginity of younger girls before getting their diplomas. Details of a practice authorities say was called the “Senior Salute” were spelled out in stark terms by a former student at the New Hampshire school, who is charged with raping a 15-year-old girl on the roof of a campus building in May 2014. Owen Labrie, now 19, has pleaded not guilty to several felonies. When his trial begins on Monday, prosecutors are expected to call current and former students to testify about the sexual culture at one of the country’s most selective boarding schools. Labrie, of Tunbridge, Vermont, talked openly about the tradition when he was interviewed by Concord police. On a campus where upperclassmen studiously avoid their younger peers in most settings, Labrie told a detective some students “take great pride” in having sex with younger students before they leave school. Labrie also told the detective of a contest where boys compete to “score” with the most girls, keeping a running tally written in indelible marker on a wall behind washing machines. The school kept painting over the scoreboard so it eventually was moved online. He acknowledged to the detective he was “trying to be number one,” the detective wrote. A counselor who contacted police after hearing from the alleged victim’s mother also told an investigator about the tradition, the Concord Monitor reported last year, citing a police affidavit. The same affidavit said the school had been trying to educate students against “sexual scoring”. Prosecutors have not indicated how far back they believe the “Senior Salute” goes. A student leader honored at graduation – two days after the alleged assault – with the Rector’s Award for “selfless devotion to school activities,” Labrie was accepted to Harvard but the school said in September that he is no longer enrolled. He told the detective that he tried to educate other students not to engage in “Senior Salute” and that the school wasn’t doing enough to curtail the tradition. “The school has to put its foot down on this culture,” Labrie is quoted as saying in a police affidavit. “It’s not healthy.” Founded in 1856, St Paul’s is an Episcopal school nestled on 2,000 pastoral acres (800 hectares) on the outskirts of downtown Concord, New Hampshire’s capital. It enrolls about 530 students and admitted girls for the first time in 1971. Tuition, room and board currently totals 53,810. The school belongs to the Eight Schools Association, a sort of Ivy League for prep schools in the US north-east. Secretary of State John Kerry graduated from St Paul’s in 1962, alongside former FBI director Robert Mueller. Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau is an alumnus as are 13 US ambassadors, three Pulitzer Prize winners, two World Series of Poker winners, actor Judd Nelson and sons of the Astor and Kennedy families, according to the school’s website. The school also has a robust international presence: 17% of the 2014-15 class came from 25 countries and notable alumni include Bernard Makihara, the former CEO of the Mitsubishi Corporation, and Edmund Maurice Burke Roche, a Conservative member of the British Parliament and the maternal grandfather of Diana, princess of Wales. The school’s rector, Michael Hirschfeld, told the Associated Press in an emailed statement that “breaches of school policies or the trust upon which they are founded, are addressed swiftly and judiciously”. Hirschfeld declined to address questions about “Senior Salute”. “St Paul’s School has policies in place to ensure that our students are safe, secure, and treated equitably,” Hirschfeld’s statement said. During a speech at family weekend at St Paul’s in October 2014, Hirschfeld said the sexual assault allegation “has provided us with an important opportunity to reconsider elements of our shared life that do not appear in our strategic plan”. “Are we confronting the transmission of unhealthier elements of school culture as effectively as we could?” he asked rhetorically. Labrie’s lawyer, JW Carney Jr, declined to comment, including on whether Labrie will testify or if his defense would raise the issue of the school’s sexual culture. Prosecutors say Labrie took his victim by surprise, before she could resist or flee, and raped her repeatedly. He is charged with three counts of aggravated felony sex assault, endangering the welfare of a child and using a computer to lure the girl to the on-campus meeting. Labrie denied having intercourse with the girl, telling police that they partially disrobed, kissed and touched. He also acknowledged putting on a condom. Labrie said the freshman girl was eager to have sex, but the aspiring divinity student said he had a “moment of self-restraint” and stopped. “He stated it was a moment of ‘divine inspiration,’” detective Julie Curtin wrote in her affidavit. Asked why the girl would lie about having sex with him, Labrie said it’s a “great source of pride for younger students” to have sex with seniors.","completion":"The trial of a former student at St. Paul's School in New Hampshire has brought attention to an alleged longstanding sexual tradition at the elite prep school called the \\"Senior Salute.\\" Owen Labrie, now 19, is charged with raping a 15-year-old girl on the roof of a campus building in May 2014 and has pleaded not guilty to several felonies. Details of the \\"Senior Salute\\" practice involve graduating boys attempting to take the virginity of younger girls before receiving their diplomas. Labrie openly discussed the tradition when interviewed by Concord police and revealed a contest where boys would compete to sleep with the most girls, keeping score on a wall before moving the tally online. Prosecutors have not indicated how far back they believe the \\"Senior Salute\\" tradition goes, and St. Paul's School rector, Michael Hirschfeld, has declined to address questions about the practice. Hirschfeld stated that the school has policies in place to ensure student safety and that breaches of these policies are addressed swiftly and judiciously. The trial will call current and former students to testify about the sexual culture at St. Paul's School, which is one of the United States' most selective boarding schools and boasts notable alumni such as Secretary of State John Kerry, former FBI director Robert Mueller, and numerous ambassadors, Pulitzer Prize winners, and other influential figures."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you need to generate an appropriate title for the given summary of some paragraph.

Question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what is the capital of kentucky known for its bluegrass?\\" Answer:","completion":"The capital of Kentucky, known for its bluegrass, is Frankfort. Frankfort is a beautiful and vibrant city that boasts a rich history and captures the essence of Bluegrass State. It is located in central Kentucky, nestled along the banks of the Kentucky River, and serves as the focal point of Franklin County. One of the first things people associate Frankfort with is its lush, green landscapes characterized by the famous Kentucky bluegrass. This unique grass is known for its rich, emerald hue that gives the rolling countryside surrounding the city its distinctive color. Kentucky bluegrass is highly prized not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its high-quality grazing land for horses, making Kentucky's horse industry one of the most renowned worldwide. As a result, Frankfort and its surroundings have become the heart of thoroughbred horse breeding and racing, with many famous horse farms and racetracks. Another factor that sets Frankfort apart is its rich bourbon distilling tradition. The city's strategic location, fertile land, and access to limestone-filtered water from the Kentucky River have made it a hub for bourbon production. Several historic distilleries can be found in and around Frankfort, offering visitors opportunities to learn about and taste the famous Kentucky spirit. Buffalo Trace, one of America's oldest continuously operating distilleries, is situated in Frankfort and is a must-visit attraction for those interested in bourbon. In addition to its legendary horses and bourbon, Frankfort is also known for its rich history. As the capital of Kentucky, the city has been the center of political events since its founding in 1792. The Kentucky State Capitol building, a magnificent Beaux-Arts structure, showcases the city's architectural prowess and serves as the heart of state government. Many other historic buildings, landmarks, and museums abound throughout Frankfort, offering a glimpse into the lives of the people who shaped its past, including the historic homes of the famous Kentucky statesman, Henry Clay, and the great artist, Paul Sawyier. Frankfort also boasts a thriving cultural scene with several art galleries, theaters, and performance spaces. The city is home to the highly acclaimed Josephine Sculpture Park, where visitors can explore an outdoor art gallery that showcases a diverse array of sculptures and installations by local and international artists. Frankfort is renowned for its community events and festivals, such as the Kentucky Derby Festival, the Kentucky State Fair, and the Frankfort Film Festival, which attract large crowds and offer something for everyone. In conclusion, when people think of Frankfort, Kentucky, they often think of its beautiful bluegrass landscapes, but the city is so much more than that. Frankfort is a place rich in history, culture, and tradition, with attractions ranging from world-famous horse farms and bourbon distilleries to impressive political landmarks and engaging community events.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation -6399*r + 12842*r - 1452 = 6377*r for r, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation on both sides if necessary. In our case, we can simplify the left side of the equation: -6399*r + 12842*r - 1452 = 6377*r Combine the terms with r: (12842 - 6399)*r - 1452 = 6377*r (6443*r) - 1452 = 6377*r Step 2: Shift all terms containing r to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. To do this, we can subtract 6377*r from both sides of the equation: 6443*r - 6377*r - 1452 = 0 (6443 - 6377)*r - 1452 = 0 66*r - 1452 = 0 Now, we'll add 1452 to both sides of the equation: 66*r = 1452 Step 3: Solve for r. Now we have a simple equation to solve for r. We just need to divide both sides by 66: r = 1452 / 66 Simplify the right side of the equation: r = 22 So, the solution to the equation -6399*r + 12842*r - 1452 = 6377*r for r is r = 22."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What key details about ernest groth can be extracted from the following bio?

At one point in the first half the Warriors trailed by 23 points, but they rallied to become just the fourth team in NBA history to open the season with 13th straight wins. “Obviously, you don’t get a trophy for it, but it’s just a nice story line and a nice way to start the season,” Stephen Curry said, per the AP. “We want to enjoy this.” Curry had 40 points on 22 shots. The Clippers had a 10-point lead with five minutes remaining in the game, but the Warriors went a little nuts to close things out. They made 8 of 9 three-pointers in the fourth quarter along with 9 of 10 free throws and closed out the game on a 25-8 run. Since start of last season, Warriors are 3-3 in games in which they trail by 20 at any point. Rest of the NBA is a combined 13-486 — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) November 20, 2015 One particular Golden State lineup — one with Draymond Green at center working the pick-and-roll with Curry — was particularly devastating, as ESPN’s Ethan Sherwood Strauss explains: The league has yet to figure out the Curry-Green pick and roll, especially in lineups where Green plays center. Teams either must concede room for a Curry 3-pointer, a mismatched switch, or a driving Green in space with which to work. A game can seem close, down to the wire. This lineup is often the sudden burst of separation, the coup de grace that reveals suspense to be an illusion. On Thursday, the Warriors rode this lineup to victory. In the final six minutes, the Green-at-center unit outscored the Clippers by 17, including a meaningless, uncontested [Chris] Paul layup at the end. It scored 25 points on eight field goal attempts, shredding the spirited Los Angeles resistance by making the right play, repeatedly. “Those numbers are insane,” Clippers star Blake Griffin (27 points) told the AP. “They’re the better team. We’re trying to get to where they’re at.” After spending the first 17 years of his Post career writing and editing, Matt and the printed paper had an amicable divorce in 2014.

Buffalo Bill was a tailor. Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Stitch of Destiny\\" Genre: Crime, Drama, Thriller Plot Outline: Buffalo Bill (William Johnson) was once a talented and successful tailor in the bustling city of New York. His bespoke suits were highly sought after, worn by the city's most powerful and affluent members. Everything seems perfect in his life – a thriving business, a loving family, and a sense of accomplishment. Little did he know that his past was about to catch up with him and change his life forever. One fateful day, a mysterious woman named Victoria Greene walks into Buffalo Bill's shop, requesting a one-of-a-kind custom suit for her husband, the notorious crime lord Vincent Greene. Unaware of the gravity of his new client's request, Buffalo Bill accepts the assignment, crafting the most exquisite suit he has ever made. When the suit is finally presented to Vincent, he becomes enamored by the tailor's outstanding work, unknowingly pulling Buffalo Bill into the dangerous web of the criminal underworld. After the assassination of Vincent, his enemies, believing that Buffalo Bill possesses information about their rival gang's activities, kidnap his family, coercing him to use his tailoring skills to their advantage. Helpless and vulnerable, Buffalo Bill is forced to craft highly specialized suits for the gangsters – ones embedded with undetectable weapons and cutting-edge technology that the criminal organization uses to commit increasingly audacious high-profile heists and assassinations. As Buffalo Bill's fears for his family's safety grow, he decides that he cannot stand idly by and let these criminals control his life. Desperate to regain control and rescue his family, he begins to study the underground network of rival gangs, using his newfound knowledge of their weaknesses to exploit their operations. Crafting ingenious disguises and using the enemies' unique signature styles against them, Buffalo Bill launches a dangerous game of deception and manipulation, using his tailoring skills to sabotage the various gangs by making it appear as though they are attacking each other. While juggling this precarious balancing act, Buffalo Bill discovers an invaluable ally in police detective Rose Thompson, who has been investigating the recent surge in gang violence. United by their shared hatred for the malevolent gangs, the two forge a bond as they work together to unravel the criminal underworld. As they secretly feed crucial intelligence to the police, a daring plan to rescue Buffalo Bill's family begins to take shape. In a thrilling climax, Buffalo Bill and Rose Thompson lead a daring police raid on the gang's secret hideout, using his tailor-made suits to infiltrate the heavily guarded compound. As the gangsters are outwitted by Buffalo Bill's clever fabrications, and the police forces swoop in, the hero and his family are finally reunited in the midst of chaos and gunfire. With the criminal enterprise dismantled, Buffalo Bill renounces his past connections to the world of crime, resolves to rebuild his life and returns to his true passion: tailoring. Re-establishing his shop and reconciling with detectives, the film concludes with a renewed sense of hope, as Buffalo Bill and his family embark on a new chapter of their lives, free from the shackles of their dark past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1590, the Spanish landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, expelling the English and Huguenot forces from much of the area. Henry IV's conversion to Catholicism in 1593 won him widespread French support for his claim to the throne, particularly in Paris , a city that he had unsuccessfully besieged in 1590. However, in 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of Brest as a launching point for an invasion of England by capturing Fort Crozon. The French civil war turned increasingly against the hardliners of the French Catholic League. With the signing of the Triple Alliance in 1596 between France, England and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the Spanish took Calais. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry retook Amiens, just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. The first tentative talks on peace had already begun before the battle. The League hardliners started to lose ground and popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry. In addition Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry's accession to the French throne. Without Spanish support the last League hardliners were quickly defeated. In May 1598, the two kings signed the Peace of Vervins ending the last of the religious civil wars and the Spanish intervention with it. Based on the above article, answer a question. How did the Spanish help the French Catholic League?","completion":"The Spanish helped the French Catholic League during the French Wars of Religion by providing military and financial support. In 1590, they landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, which resulted in the expulsion of English and Huguenot forces from much of the area. The Spanish backing also played a crucial role in bolstering the League's hardliner faction, allowing them to continue their fight against the Protestant Huguenots and the forces supporting Henry IV's claim to the throne. Spanish support extended to other strategic gains as well, such as the capture of Calais in 1596, which threatened England and prompted the formation of the Triple Alliance between France, England, and the Dutch Republic. Ultimately, the Spanish intervention in France maintained the intensity of the conflict and prolonged the French civil war. However, the tide began to turn against the French Catholic League, as Henry IV's conversion to Catholicism won him broader support, and Spanish finances became strained due to multiple ongoing wars. This eventually led to King Philip's decision to end his support for the French Catholic League and recognize the legitimacy of Henry's accession to the French throne, culminating in the Peace of Vervins in 1598."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Process: - Water comes through a filter - The filter has small pores to catch pollutants - The filter will catch chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals - The filter allows water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through - The water on the other side of the filter is much cleaner - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the water is contaminated prior to filtering through outside interference. happens, how will it affect the purified water will contain more trace impurities.. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the water purification process. Direct effects: 1. If the water is contaminated prior to filtering due to outside interference, the filter may become overloaded with pollutants and may not be able to effectively remove all of the contaminants. 2. Contaminants not typically found in regular tap water may pass through the filter if the filter is not designed to capture those specific impurities. These contaminants may then be present in the purified water. Indirect effects: 1. If the filter becomes overloaded or clogged due to an excess of contaminants, the overall effectiveness and lifespan of the filter can be significantly reduced. This can potentially lead to frequent filter replacements or costly maintenance. 2. The presence of additional contaminants in the purified water can impact the taste, odor, and appearance of the water, leading to dissatisfaction for anyone consuming it. 3. Over time, the presence of unfiltered contaminants in the purified water can potentially pose health risks if they are toxic or harmful substances. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that external contamination of the water prior to filtering can lead to various direct and indirect effects on the water purification process, including reduced filter efficiency and potential health risks in the purified water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: During their early days as the Silver Beatles in Hamburg in the 1960s, they performed as Sheridan's backing band. Starr wrote on his Twitter: \\"Goodbye to Tony Sheridan... I had a great month 1960-61, playing with him was great.\\" Described as a catalyst in the Beatles' rise to fame, they played on Sheridan's recording of My Bonnie. After being spotted by producer Bert Kaempfert, it was their first studio session for Polydor as The Beat Brothers in June 1961. Later that year, teenage fan Raymond Jones requested the song in Brian Epstein's record store. Epstein promised to order it and later became the Beatles' manager, whom many still regard as the \\"fifth Beatle\\". Returning to Germany in 1961, the young Beatles and Sheridan continued their collaboration and - at Kaempfert's instigation - recorded seven tracks. A 1962 show at the Star Club in Hamburg, where the Liverpool band played many of their early shows, was a watershed performance - featuring Starr on drums - and helped catapult the Beatles to fame. According to reports in the German media, Sheridan died on Saturday 16 February following a long illness. Sir Paul McCartney has issued a statement on his website. He said: \\"Tony was a good guy who we knew and worked with from the early days in Hamburg. We regularly watched his late night performances and admired his style. He will be missed.\\" In the early 1960s, the singer-songwriter toured with rock 'n roll pioneers Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran. He had German Top 10 singles Let's Slop and Skinny Minnie and with the Fab Four's early commercial success, My Bonnie charted in both Britain and the US. During his later years, Sheridan lived with his third wife, Anna Sievers, in a farm house in the north of Germany.

Here is a question about this article: In monotheism and henotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by theologians commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence. God is also usually defined as a non-corporeal being without any human biological gender, but the concept of God actively (as opposed to receptively) creating the universe has caused some religions to give \\"Him\\" the metaphorical name of \\"Father\\". Because God is conceived as not being a corporeal being, God cannot(some say should not) be portrayed in a literal visual image; some religious groups use a man (sometimes old and bearded) to symbolize God because of His deed of creating man's mind in the image of His own. What is the answer to this question: What is infinite knowledge classified as?","completion":"Infinite knowledge, often associated with the attribute of omniscience, is classified as the all-encompassing and complete understanding of everything that has occurred, is occurring, and will occur in the entire universe. This attribute signifies that a being with infinite knowledge possesses perfect and unlimited awareness of all aspects of existence, including every event, action, thought, and consequence that has ever taken place or will take place in the future. In the context of monotheism and henotheism, infinite knowledge is considered an essential attribute of God, the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. As an omniscient being, God is believed to have an all-encompassing understanding of the universe, including the intricate workings, laws, and relationships that govern its existence. Such infinite knowledge also implies that God has complete foresight of future events and the outcomes of all possible decisions or actions taken by any being, while simultaneously being aware of every individual's thoughts, feelings, intentions, desires, and motivations. This attribute of God, along with omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (being present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence, are central to theologies that aim to define and explore the nature, characteristics, and workings of the Divine within their respective belief systems. These theological explorations of God's nature may also delve into the rationale behind the Divine's interaction with and guidance of the world, as well as the implications of God's infinite knowledge on the subjects of human free will, morality, and purpose. Due to its profound implications on various philosophical and religious debates, the concept of infinite knowledge or omniscience has been widely studied and analyzed by academics, theologians, and philosophers from various fields, often resulting in diverse and nuanced perspectives that seek to understand the extent, implications, and constraints of possessing absolute, all-encompassing knowledge of the entire realm of existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the people who discover that their creation is aging at a vastly accelerated rate? Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other platform. By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7.5 games per console in the US; the rate was 7.0 in Europe, while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii), according to Microsoft. At the 2008 Game Developers Conference, Microsoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year. As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and Gears of War, the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives, including Devil May Cry, Ace Combat, Virtua Fighter, Grand Theft Auto IV, Final Fantasy XIII, Tekken 6, Metal Gear Solid : Rising, and L.A.

Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\".

He traded country N's currency. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which trader would most likely be engaged in black market trading, trader A or trader B? Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","completion":"Given the information and the hint provided, it is more likely that Trader A, who traded Country M's currency (which is pegged to a fixed price), could be engaged in black market trading.

The French hospital treating Michael Schumacher has denied rumours that the Formula One legend has died. Grenoble University Hospital put an end to wild speculation circulating on the internet, including social networking site Twitter. A statement read: ‘The hospital denies that Michael Schumacher has died.’ The French hospital treating Michael Schumacher has denied rumours that the Formula One legend has died. Rumours of his death prompted some journalists to gather at the hospital. Schumacher, 45, was put into an artificial coma after suffering traumatic brain injury in a near-fatal skiing accident on December 29. Shutting down function can give the brain time to heal. Last week his manager Sabine Kehm confirmed that he was being brought round from his coma. Grenoble University Hospital put an end to wild speculation circulating on the internet, including social networking site Twitter. She said: ‘Michael’s sedation has recently been reduced to initiate a process of awakening which may take a long time.’ According to sources cited in the French media the seven-time world champion blinked during brain tests last week. Citing ‘very reliable sources’, L’Equipe newspaper said Schumacher had undergone a number of neurological tests and had responded ‘positively’. Michael Schumacher is being slowly brought out of his induced coma, his manager has said. His wife Corinna insists her husband is a 'fighter' who will not give up. Probe: Investigators at the site of Schumacher's crash earlier this month where he smashed his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in Meribel, France. Surgeons performed two operations to relieve pressure on his brain and remove blood clots in the days following his accident. Wife Corinna, 44, with whom the champion has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. Schumacher had his catastrophic accident in the French ski resort of Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He had been skiing on the piste with his son Mick, 14, and family friends. Shortly after 11am he skied on to a patch of rocky off-piste located in between two runs. He skied into a rock and then catapulted on to another banging his head with such force that his helmet split in two. Strain: Corinna Schumacher and their children have been maintaining a constant bedside vigil since his crash. He was wearing a helmet camera and his entire accident was recorded. Investigators said it was a freak accident and Schumacher, who is a very competent skier, was not skiing at an excessive speed. He was airlifted off the mountain and taken to Grenoble University Hospital where doctors put him into a medically-induced coma. A scan revealed he had suffered serious brain damage. His manager released a statement later that night saying the sportsman was fighting for his life. A top neurosurgeon said stricken Michael Schumacher's brain cells are 'working together like a Formula One team' in a bid to get him to wake up from his six week long coma. Dr Munther Sabarini, neurosurgeon and founder of the Avicenna Hospitals in Berlin, Hamburg and Zurich, says the vital pyramidal neurons - control cells - 'are working together, so to speak, like an F1 team. So if a driver shows weakness, then another driver takes over under the new situation. So it is with the brain cells. You can support brain function with a lot of resources so that the healing process is accelerated and cause as little damage as possible. 'Typically high-energy bodily functions are shut down during a coma. Only after awakening can they be enabled again. The vital signs are observed and corrected. It is then up to the doctors to do a great deal; physiotherapy, mental care, treatment of new or old diseases. 'Depending on the aid required the patient receives medication - usually called neuro vitamins - but the measures applied vary stronly from case to case. After awakening one needs a few months to a few years to learn to overcome physical changes. Young and healthy people like Michael Schumacher have better chances to recover from such a trauma.' His medical team at the Grenoble University Hospital in France announced last week they are slowly reducing the anaesthetic that has kept Schumacher, 45, unconscious since his low-speed ski accident on December 29 when he smashed his head on to rocks. This could take many more weeks. Anaesthetic gases which may have accumulated in his body's fatty tissue must be removed extremely slowly. So far, there have been no facial or bodily responses to his environment, according to medical sources. He receives food through a tube to his stomach, oxygen via a hose from a machine next to his bed as he still cannot breathe independently. Three times daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores. The coma suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake-up phase to see if such things are returning naturally. Experts say that perhaps the greatest risk of all facing Schumacher in his prone position is pneumonia. The lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory infection. Andreas Pingel, medical director of the Centre for Spine Surgery and Neuro-Traumatology at the BG Hospital in Frankfurt told Germany's Focus Magazine; 'About 30 to 50 percent of all patients who lie in a coma as long as Michael Schumacher has get it.' His blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing. He lies on a special air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under constant vigliance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing a potentially fatal infection.

While the average customer is usually left venting to friends and family or writing a complaint email, hoping it doesn't end up in a black hole, one well-known celebrity's experience shows that leveraging the power of social media—in this case, Twitter—can get you the results you are looking for, and quickly. The Kevin Smith Case Kevin Smith, director of movies such as \\"Clerks\\" and \\"Dogma,\\" has built a loyal fan base throughout his career. Smith's name alone may not have the power to bend the will of Southwest Airlines, but his social media following certainly does. After experiencing trouble on a Southwest Airlines flight in 2010, Smith took to Twitter, posting a series of angry tweets to let his fans know about his situation. He had been removed from a flight for being “too hefty,” causing him embarrassment and frustration. Smith's tweets not only went viral, garnering thousands of retweets and likes but also caught the attention of the airline in question. What happened next is now the stuff of internet legend: within hours of Smith's social media venting, the director received an apology from Southwest Airlines. The company took responsibility for their inconsistent application of their own policy and issued a statement extending their regrets to Smith and promising to review their policies to avoid future issues. The quick response and seeming genuine contrition on the part of Southwest was a key factor in turning a potentially damaging public relations nightmare into somewhat of a PR win for the company. Leveraging Twitter for Better Customer Service The Kevin Smith incident serves as a perfect example of how social media platforms, such as Twitter, can act as a valuable tool, for the customer and the airline, when it comes to addressing and resolving complaints. While not everyone may have the level of celebrity or social media clout that Smith does, customers who find themselves struggling with airline issues should not dismiss the tactic. By tagging the airline's official account in your tweet and using appropriate hashtags, you may just have your concerns addressed more efficiently than you would via email or over the phone. Travel experts agree that being assertive and public with an airline's shortcomings can bring about a quick resolution. As more and more airlines are recognizing the power of social media and the importance of engaging with customers online, many have hired social media teams specifically to handle customer complaints and issues sent via Twitter or Facebook. Airline reputation is critical in the highly competitive industry, and they do not want negative experiences garnering viral attention. Takeaways for Airline Customers In a nutshell, the Kevin Smith tweetstorm and Southwest Airlines' subsequent response underline the importance of social media in modern customer service. While writing a complaint email or making a phone call to customer support may seem like the traditional route to take, consider these takeaways: 1. Utilize platforms like Twitter and Facebook: Not only do you have a chance of rapidly receiving a response, but making the complaint public also puts pressure on the airline to address the issue and maintain their reputation. 2. Be strategic: Directly tag the airline's official account and use appropriate hashtags, making sure your complaint is visible to the airline and the wider public. 3. Be polite and concise: Despite the frustration and emotions that may be involved, articulate your issue clearly and politely in your message. A respectful tone is likely to encourage a better and faster response from the airline. By following these lessons from the Kevin Smith incident, customers can potentially turn their own negative experiences into positive resolutions, while airlines can take the opportunity to improve and showcase their customer service commitment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cornell Dupree, Studio Guitarist, Is Dead at 68 Cornell Dupree, a guitarist whose quietly bluesy style made him an in-demand session musician throughout the 1960s and ’70s for artists like Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon and Ringo Starr, died May 8 at his home in Fort Worth. He was 68. Cornell Dupree onstage in New York City in 1996. The cause was emphysema, said David Kramer, his agent and longtime friend, who had organized a benefit concert for him in New York in March. The average listener may not have known Mr. Dupree’s name (“Not many people read the back of albums,” he acknowledged in a 1997 interview in The Dallas Observer), but millions knew his playing. His licks are an indispensable part of a number of Ms. Franklin’s biggest hits, Brook Benton’s “Rainy Night in Georgia” and many other records. By his own estimate, he played on about 2,500 sessions. Jerry Wexler, the Atlantic Records executive who produced hits for Ms. Franklin and many others, said on several occasions that he had often used three guitarists on the sessions he supervised, to get as full a sound as possible, until he realized Mr. Dupree was the only one he needed. Though best known as a rhythm-and-blues player, accompanying performers like Wilson Pickett and B. B. King, Mr. Dupree also performed or recorded with Joe Cocker, Barbra Streisand, Laura Nyro, Bonnie Raitt and Mariah Carey, among other pop stars. He played on Mr. Simon’s 1973 hit album “There Goes Rhymin’ Simon” and Mr. Starr’s R&B-influenced album “Ringo the 4th.” When Miles Davis, the great jazz trumpeter, was searching for a funkier and more contemporary sound in the early 1970s, Mr. Dupree was among the musicians he used on his album “Get Up With It.” Mr. Dupree’s most enduring associations were with Ms. Franklin and the saxophonist King Curtis. He joined King Curtis and the Kingpins in 1962 (Jimi Hendrix was briefly in the band with him) and was still a member when Ms. Franklin hired them to accompany her on tour in 1967. King Curtis died in 1971, but Mr. Dupree remained with Ms. Franklin until 1976. Around the time he left Ms. Franklin, he and a number of other session musicians began recording and performing as a group. Known as Stuff, they made several all-instrumental albums for Warner Brothers and toured extensively. Mr. Dupree also recorded as a bandleader; his last album, for the Austin label Dialtone, has not yet been released. Cornell Dupree Jr. was born Dec. 19, 1942, in Fort Worth, the only child of Cornell and Bernice Dupree. His first instrument was the saxophone, but he began playing guitar in his early teens.

Article: In an emphatic declaration, Mecklenburg District Attorney Andrew Murray said Wednesday he found no legal wrongdoing in the shooting death of a Charlotte man by police, and denounced pervasive rumors spread by social media about the case. Murray laid out in painstaking detail the evidence gathered in the Sept. 20 fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, 43, by officer Brentley Vinson. “I’m extremely convinced that Mr. Vinson’s use of deadly force was lawful,” Murray said. Digital Access for only 0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Evidence in the case shows that Scott stepped out of his SUV with a gun in his hand, Murray said, and ignored at least 10 commands from the five officers on the scene to drop it. Murray said that Scott bought the gun – a Colt .380 semi-automatic that had been stolen in Gaston County – 18 days before the confrontation for 100. One bullet was found in the chamber of the cocked gun, the safety was off and Murray said Scott’s DNA was found on the grip and slide. The person who sold the gun to Scott admitted to doing so when confronted by state and federal law enforcement, according to a prosecutor’s report on the shooting. “The seller said that Scott asked him to find him a weapon because he was having problems with his wife and her family, specifically his nephew,” the report said. Murray said that speculation in the community that Scott was unarmed – initial reports from a family member on Facebook said he was holding a book – were untrue. “A reading book was not found in the front or back seats of Mr. Scott’s SUV,” Murray said. Officer Vinson’s Smith & Wesson M&P .40 was examined after the shooting and four bullets were missing, Murray said. Analysts determined that the four shell casings found on the scene were fired from Vinson’s weapon. Scott suffered three gunshot wounds. Guns taken from the other officers at the scene had not been fired, he said. People who claimed on social media that they had seen the shooting and Scott was unarmed later recanted – three people who’d made the claim told State Bureau of Investigation agents in interviews that they hadn’t actually seen the shooting, Murray said. Murray said he ran the evidence in the case past 15 veteran prosecutors in his office and they were unanimous in their recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to charge Vinson in the case. Two of those prosecutors were African-American and one was Latino, Murray said. In the aftermath of Scott’s death, Charlotte was roiled by two nights of rioting and nearly a week of street demonstrations. After street violence, dozens of arrests and the death of one man in uptown, Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency. CMPD was the original agency investigating Scott’s shooting, but the SBI took over when his wife, Rakeyia Scott, exercised her right under N.C. law to have the independent agency do the inquiry. Scott, father of seven, a former shopping mall security officer and the son of a police detective, suffered from traumatic brain injury sustained during a motorcycle crash in South Carolina in November 2015. Medical records obtained during the SBI inquiry showed that Scott had difficulties with aggression and anger management. “Scott was battling an array of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, hallucinations and paranoia,” the report said. “Two weeks prior to his death, Rakeyia Scott told her husband’s therapist that his temper and impatience had increased, and as she stated, ‘something has to give.’” Scott was a convicted felon who was sentenced in 2005 to seven years in prison in Texas for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. City’s reaction Neither Mayor Jennifer Roberts nor Police Chief Kerr Putney commented about the findings, but the city of Charlotte released a statement: “We recognize that for some members of our community, this news will be met with different reactions. No matter where you stand on the issue, the events surrounding the Scott shooting have forever changed our community, and we intend to learn from and build a stronger Charlotte because of it,” the statement said. “The city is committed to continuing its work with the community to preserve safety, trust and accountability.” Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police were put on alert for the community’s reaction to the announcement. All the department’s specialized units, including its riot squad, were mobilized. CMPD’s command center, which was used during the 2012 Democratic National Convention and other high-profile events, also was activated. Officers were notified that they may have to work 12-hour shifts. Murray met Wednesday morning with Rakeyia Scott and Charles Monnett, an attorney representing the family. “The family was very gracious,” Murray said. Monnett and other attorneys representing the family said that CMPD’s handling of the confrontation was flawed. “We believe this situation....could have ended with everyone alive,” Monnett said. “We look forward someday to obtaining justice for this family.” He also said it still wasn’t clear whether officers had been properly trained or followed departmental policy when they confronted Scott. Social media reports Murray said that rumors and social media reports about the case did not stand up to scrutiny, among them: That Scott was unarmed, that he was holding a book not a gun, that he didn’t own a weapon, that other officers at the scene shot Scott besides Vinson. Rakeyia Scott gave statements after the shooting, Murray said, that her husband did not have a gun. She has maintained that he did not have a firearm after January 2016, though Murray said the two had quarreled over text messages in the weeks before the shooting about his gun. In all, 63 SBI agents were assigned to the investigation, about a quarter of the agency’s force, Murray said. In laying out a timeline of the shooting, he said officers were staked out in the parking lot of Scott’s apartment complex looking for a suspect in an unrelated case. They saw Scott pull in, then leave. Murray then showed a surveillance video from a nearby 7-Eleven store of Scott walking in. Murray said there was a bulge clearly visible at the right ankle where Scott holstered his gun. Then, Murray said, Scott returned to the parking lot next to the officers, hollowed the tobacco out of a cigarello and began stuffing what appeared to be marijuana into it from a pill bottle. Only when Vinson saw Scott hold up a semi-automatic pistol did officers decide to confront him, Murray said. Vinson and another officer drove away, put on tactical vests labeled “Police” and called for other officers to help them and a marked police SUV with a uniformed officer. When they arrived, they blocked Scott’s SUV and called on him to come out, then told him at least 10 times to drop the gun, Murray said. “Mr. Scott did not comply with those commands,” Murray said. Scott held the gun in his hand, though he didn’t raise it, Murray said. Officers said in interviews with investigators that Scott appeared to have a blank stare and was in a trance-like state, Murray said. Vinson fired four shots, wounding Scott three times. When Scott fell, his gun landed near his waist and one of the officers pushed it away from him, then stood over it, Murray said. Gun is key fact Robert Taylor, a professor of criminology at the University of Texas at Dallas and a former police officer in Portland, Ore, said clearing Vinson of any criminal wrongdoing in the shooting was an easy call. A person with a gun under those circumstances is a danger to officers and the public, Taylor said. “This is pretty cut and dry,” he said. Now, he said, Charlotte leaders must try to rebuild the fractured relationship between the police department and the African-American community. “I try to stay positive and remind people that before any great change in this country there has been conflict,” Taylor said. “There are real feelings of fear in the African-American community. You have to build trust over a long period of time. You just can’t wait until something else happens ... The onus is on the police department to take a positive approach and look for what good can come out of this. Where do we go as a community?” Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and nationally known police accountability expert, said it was always unlikely that Vinson would be criminally charged. Nationwide, few officers face legal consequences following police shootings, Walker said. Even when they are charged, judges and juries usually exonerate them, he said. Prosecutors are reluctant to bring cases against officers, Walker said, because they depend on a cooperative relationship with police to do their jobs. “Chances of increasing the number of prosecutions is very low,” Walker said. “These are people you know. That’s tough. Then they start calculating the odds of getting a conviction. It’s pretty low.” Jury’s view Darrel Stephens, former CMPD chief and executive director of the Major Cities Police Chiefs Association, said Murray’s decision seems to validate CMPD’s account of the confrontation. The department maintained from the beginning that Scott was holding a gun and that he failed to follow commands, Stephens noted. While protesters and others have criticized how the officers approached Scott, Stephens said the presence of a gun reduces law enforcement’s ability to safely negotiate with a suspect. “You don’t know what the person is going to do,” Stephens said. “De-escalation is always an expectation, but it’s easy to stand on the sidelines and say they should have done this or that. They were not there. It’s very different to be there.” Kenneth Williams, a professor at the Houston College of Law and an expert on police use of force, said the key fact from the video footage was that it appeared Scott ignored commands from officers to drop a weapon. That meant Scott did not have to raise a gun or point the weapon to be considered an imminent threat, Williams said. “I find it hard to believe a jury of 12 people would convict an officer under those circumstances,” Williams said. “The prosecutor is in a difficult position. Juries give police the benefit of the doubt.” Legal boundaries North Carolina law allows the use of lethal force by police “only when it appears reasonably necessary ... to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.” One of the clarifying gauges: Would another “reasonable officer” in the same situation act the same way? The so-called “objective reasonableness” standard used in courtrooms originated from a Charlotte excessive force case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1980s. It asks jurors to assess an officer’s conduct on one key factor: Given the same set of circumstances, would reasonable officers react the same way? N.C.’s Basic Law Enforcement Training Manual says elements of “objective reasonableness” include the capability of a subject’s ability to carry out the threat of deadly force, whether the threat is imminent and whether the subject has indicated by word or deed that he intends to cause harm. Criminal charges against police officers related to on-duty shootings are rare. In 2013, Officer Wes Kerrick was arrested and charged with voluntary manslaughter in the shooting death of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed African-American man. Then-police chief Rodney Monroe argued that there was no evidence of malice on Kerrick’s part, ruling out a murder or a stronger manslaughter count. Kerrick used bad judgment and excessive force in defending himself, but did not have any premeditation, Monroe said. Kerrick’s 2015 trial ended with a deadlocked jury that had voted 8-4 for acquittal. Earlier, the city of Charlotte had paid a 2.25 million settlement to Ferrell’s family. Put on leave Vinson, who fired the shots, was immediately put on administrative leave, which is routine in such cases. Vinson, 26, was in plain clothes but wore a vest that identified him as a police officer. He joined CMPD in 2014 and was assigned to the Metro Division. At the time of the shooting, he had no disciplinary actions on his personnel record. Vinson played football for Ardrey Kell High School and was an all-conference safety and wide receiver in his junior year. He missed playing his senior year because of injury. He studied criminal justice at Liberty University, where he was football captain and defensive back with a team-high 69 tackles in 2012, his senior year. ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The district attorney decided not to charge Officer Brent Vinson for killing Keith Scott, citing evidence that Scott was armed and could have shot the officer.

A short time later, Murray said officers were on an unrelated call when they saw Scott, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle crash in October 2015, parked in his SUV at an apartment complex. They ordered him to exit his vehicle after seeing him brandish a handgun, Murray said. Murray said the videos show that officers told Scott to drop his gun at least 10 times. \\"The videos also show that Mr. Scott did not comply with those commands,\\" Murray said. He said Vinson fired four times, hitting Scott three times. Murray said Scott's DNA was found on the gun recovered at the scene.

Article:A flinty, austere, exacting figure, Tyrie has been chair of both the Treasury select committee since 2010, but probably reached the zenith of his influence leading the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which helped shape the post financial crisis framework for the banking system, pushing the government rather further than it wanted to go, in the process. Set up in 2012, in the wake of the LIBOR interest-rate-fixing scandal, the Commission yomped through a prodigious amount of policy work at a gruelling pace. Its vast reports had huge leverage over the post-crisis banking legislation, not least because the authors sat in both the Lords and Commons - and those in the Lords, including the former Chancellor Lord Lawson, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, were influential voices in debates on banking legislation, at a time when those issues were politically radioactive By the end of its life, relations on the Commission had frayed to the point that members were briefing against each other in pretty venomous terms. Despite that, the exercise was so influential that it may be a long time before another government creates such an effective whip for its own back - and ministers certainly did not fancy setting up a second Parliamentary Commission, this time to review the future of the Civil Service, and the proposal was eventually fought to a standstill. It is no coincidence that Tyrie's statement announcing his departure noted that \\"stronger committees now demand better explanations for the decisions made by ministers, regulators, and quangos than hitherto.\\" And as chair of the super-committee of select committee chairs, the Commons Liaison Committee, he worked hard to underpin the new status and powers of the select committee system. He also tried to bring in a more exacting interrogation of the prime minister in the Liaison Committee's termly hearings with the PM, once provoking an exasperated David Cameron to shoot back at him: \\"You don't know what you're talking about\\" - as he probed the UK's involvement in the Syrian civil war. In a similar vein, Tyrie also led the all party parliamentary group on Rendition, which pursued evidence of UK complicity in the Bush administration's seizure of terrorist suspects. Never a minister, and only briefly a shadow minister, Tyrie arguably made his biggest mark on political history as a special advisor to Chancellor Norman Lamont - he had been drafted in on a temporary basis to help out at the Treasury, in the early months of John Major's premiership, and one of his final task was to recommend a successor. And his choice, on the basis that what was needed was less a policy advisor and more a spin doctor, was a bright young chap named David Cameron. The rest is history. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The article discusses the influential career of Andrew Tyrie, who chaired the Treasury select committee and led the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards.

During that time the students live in the wilderness and go through many physical activities of ever increasing difficulty. The first few days are given to physical conditioning and to the teaching of basic skills such as first aid, map and compass reading, rope climbing, and other similar activities. During the second part of the course students learn how to climb rocks and cliffs, how to use canoes and rafts in swift water, and in some schools how to sail, ski, climb mountains, and make long-distance hikes. The first two parts of the course are done in groups. Members work together and help each other to overcome the increasing number of challenges. In the third part of the course, students are sent out alone for three days to survive in the wilderness with only a few necessities. Who are the students of Outward Bound? They are both young people and adults, men and women. The minimum age is 16.5 years. There is no maximum age. About one-third of the 6,000 persons completing the course each year are women. Businessmen, housewives, university students, professors, doctors, and lawyers are among those taking part in the course. In recent years special courses for the busy business managers have gained in popularity. These courses last from five to ten days rather than the usual three to four weeks of the normal course. Not all students complete the Outward Bound course. In some cases the individual cannot meet the physical challenges. In its own words Outward Bound literature says: \\"Make no mistake, Outward Bound is not for everybody. The courses aren't easy and are not meant to be.\\" Most students who finish the course share a common experience. They are surprised at themselves that they finish the course and they feel great pride in doing the impossible! The Outward Bound experience makes them feel that they are better than they know!

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the title of the painting given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66? , can you please find it? The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving nude by Velázquez, but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th-century Spanish inventories. Two were mentioned in the Royal collection, but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main Royal Palace of Madrid. A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel. These records mention \\"a reclining Venus\\", Venus and Adonis, and a Psyche and Cupid.Although the work is widely thought to have been painted from life, the identity of the model is subject to much speculation. In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies; however, the use of female nude models was frowned upon. The painting is believed to have been executed during one of Velázquez's visits to Rome, and Prater has observed that in Rome the artist \\"did indeed lead a life of considerable personal liberty that would have been consistent with the notion of using a live nude female model\\". It has been claimed that the painting depicts a mistress Velázquez is known to have had while in Italy, who is supposed to have borne his child. Others have claimed that the model is the same as in Coronation of the Virgin and Las Hilanderas, both in the Museo del Prado, and other works.The figures of both Venus and Cupid were significantly altered during the painting process, the result of the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some...

He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system. Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999.

Here is a premise: These risks would be acceptably mitigated if the statistical sampling plan provided for (1) the scope or extent of invoice examination to be commensurate with the risk to the government,14 (2) sampling from the universe of all invoices under 2,500 not subject to complete examination, (3) effective monitoring to ensure that the plan is effectively implemented and the risks to the government remain within tolerable limits, and (4) a continuing relationship with the vendor so that the risk of loss is minimized. Here is a hypothesis: They did not foresee any risks. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Here's the reasoning: 1. First, let's understand the premise. The premise states that risks would be acceptably mitigated with a specific statistical sampling plan that provides a certain examination scope, sampling from all invoices under 2,500, effective monitoring, and a continuing relationship with the vendor. 2. Next, let's analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"they did not foresee any risks.\\" 3. Now, let's compare the premise and the hypothesis. The premise is discussing how to mitigate risks, which implies that risks do exist and have been considered. In contrast, the hypothesis claims that no risks were foreseen. 4. Based on the comparison, we can see that the hypothesis contradicts the premise as the premise considers risks and provides ways to mitigate them, while the hypothesis suggests that risks were not foreseen. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, as they seem to portray contradicting statements about the presence of risks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When he looked closely, he found that in product A packaging carbon monoxide was used, but in product B carbon monoxide was not used. He asked the store clerk what difference it made. Which product would less likely look fresher, product A or product B?","completion":"To determine which product would less likely look fresher, let's examine the role of carbon monoxide in meat packaging and consider the effect it has on the appearance of the meat. Step 1: Research the purpose of carbon monoxide in meat packaging Carbon monoxide is used in some meat packaging to help maintain the red color of the meat by reacting with the myoglobin, which is the protein responsible for giving meat its red color. This process is called carboxymyoglobin formation. Step 2: Understand the effect of carbon monoxide on the appearance of meat By forming carboxymyoglobin, carbon monoxide helps the meat maintain a bright red color, which is typically associated with freshness. In the absence of carbon monoxide, the meat might turn brown or grayish due to oxidation, even if it is still good to eat. This color change, however, may lead consumers to believe that the meat is no longer fresh. Step 3: Compare product A and product B based on freshness appearance Product A uses carbon monoxide in its packaging, which means that it will likely maintain a bright red color for a longer period, appearing fresher. Product B does not use carbon monoxide, so the natural oxidation process may cause the meat to lose its red color, leading to the perception that it is not as fresh. Conclusion: Based on the role of carbon monoxide in preserving the red color of meat, product B, which does not use carbon monoxide in its packaging, would less likely look fresher compared to product A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: One of the most popular American singers of the twentieth century was Elvis Presley. He made the Rock & Roll music popular around the world. He sold millions of records and made many successful films, and he helped change the direction of popular music in the 1960s. Elvis Presley was born in a poor family in 1935. His parents were simple country people who often took him to church, where he learned to sing and he never forgot the kind of songs that he used to sing in church as a child. When he was a teenager, Elvis moved from Tupelos to Memphis in Tennessee, where he attended high school, but he was not a good student. His only real interest was singing. He began to sing in the style that is called \\"country and western\\". In 1955 he recorded some songs for his mother's birthday. The people at the recording studio liked his singing and his music. There was something different about it. It was country and western music, but it also sounded a little like the music, which black people used to sing in the American South, music known as \\"blues\\". Shortly after that, Elvis met Tom Parker, who became his manager and arranged concerts for him across the United States and new recordings as well. Soon Elvis rose to fame all over the country. Later, Elvis went to Hollywood and began to appear in films like Love Me Tender and King Creole. But Elvis found it hard to live with success, like many other entertainment personalities .He began to take drugs and his health began to suffer. When he died at an early age of 42 in 1977, his many millions of fans were shocked. \\"The King Is Dead!\\" the newspaper said. But today his memory and his music live on and he will always be remembered as the King of Rock & Roll. Question: Judging from the passage, we may conclude _ .

Generally, substances can exist in three different states: solid, liquid, and gas. These state transitions are primarily governed by changes in temperature, pressure, or both. The right answer to the question \\"Heat can change something that has how many states?\\" can be more accurately described as follows: Heat possesses the capacity to change substances with all three states - solid, liquid, and gas - as opposed to limiting the changes to only two states. The transitions between these states are known as phase changes or phase transitions. The primary phase changes involving heat include: 1. Melting: The transition from a solid to a liquid state, often resulting from the absorption of heat energy. A substance’s melting point is the temperature at which this transition occurs, provided that the pressure remains constant. 2. Freezing: The transition from a liquid to a solid state, usually caused by the release of heat energy. A substance’s freezing point refers to the temperature at which this transition happens under constant pressure. 3. Vaporization: The change from a liquid to a gas state, which comprises evaporation and boiling. This phase change requires the absorption of heat energy, and it occurs when the substance reaches its boiling point at a fixed pressure level. 4. Condensation: The transformation from a gas to a liquid state, typically due to a reduction in temperature or increase in pressure. This transition involves the release of heat energy. 5. Sublimation: The direct conversion from a solid to a gas state without passing through the liquid phase. Sublimation requires the absorption of heat energy and occurs at specific temperature and pressure conditions. 6. Deposition: The direct transition from a gas to a solid state without becoming a liquid. This change involves the release of heat energy. In conclusion, it is more accurate to say that heat can change something with three states – solid, liquid, and gas – rather than attributing the changes to only two states. Heat energy has the potential to facilitate various phase transitions across all three states, under the right temperature and pressure conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The Very Rev Dr Sandy McDonald, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1997-98, had been fighting the degenerative lung disease pulmonary fibrosis. He died at the Erskine Care Home in Bishopton, Renfrewshire on Thursday. Current Moderator, the Rt Rev Dr Angus Morrison, said: \\"Dr Sandy McDonald was a wonderful man and minister.\\" He added: \\"Genuine love for people was a defining mark of his ministry. \\"He had a special concern for the well-being, at every level, of his fellow ministers. Sandy's memory will be cherished by many.\\" He is survived by three children, including Doctor Who and Broadchurch star Tennant, who was born in Bathgate, West Lothian. Tennant is understood to have taken his stage name from the Pet Shop Boys frontman Neil Tennant after reading a copy of Smash Hits magazine. Dr McDonald was described by colleagues as a \\"beloved figure, widely admired for his fearlessness, generosity and irrepressible high spirits\\". In the 1980s he co-presented religious programme That's The Spirit on STV, and once appeared with Tennant as a guest on cookery show Ready Steady Cook. He also took on a cameo role alongside his son in an episode of Doctor Who in 2008. Following his diagnosis, he spoke out in favour of the right to die of terminally ill people, contrary to the Kirk's official position on the issue. Former Kirk moderator the Very Rev John Chalmers said: \\"Working with Sandy McDonald was one of the great pleasures of my career in ministry. \\"It was no surprise to me when Sandy called for a serious dialogue on the right to die - he was a man who tempered his views in the light of reality, he was a man who sat lightly to dogma and who preferred faith in action. \\"The Church of Scotland needs a new breed of Sandy McDonalds who catch a passion for the good news of Jesus Christ, but whose understanding of the faith is not frozen in time, but develops and matures with new revelation and understanding.\\" Dr McDonald was born in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire, in 1937 and trained for the ministry after national service with the Royal Air Force. He served at St David's Parish Church in Bathgate, and St Mark's Parish Church in Ralston, Renfrewshire, and then as general secretary of the Church of Scotland's board of ministry until he retired in 2002. Helen, his wife of more than 40 years, died in 2007. Friend the Very Rev Dr Lorna Hood said: \\"Sandy didn't just preach. He put his whole self into it - his arms, his voice, his whole body went into his sermons. \\"People loved it when he preached. He was a great pastor and he held parish ministry at the heart of the Church.\\" Summary:","completion":"The Very Rev Dr Sandy McDonald, a former Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, has passed away after battling pulmonary fibrosis. Dr McDonald, who was the father of Doctor Who and Broadchurch actor David Tennant, was remembered as a \\"wonderful man and minister\\" with a \\"genuine love for people.\\" After being diagnosed with his terminal illness, Dr McDonald became a vocal supporter of the right to die for terminally ill patients, which went against the official stance of the Church of Scotland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Grassland in the Santa Rosa Plateau , California . Question: what are they like in tropical grassland in plant Answer:","completion":"Tropical grasslands, also known as savannas, are characterized by a mixture of grasses and scattered trees with a warm climate and pronounced wet and dry seasons. The tropical grasslands support a wide variety of plant life, including: 1. Grasses: The dominant vegetation in tropical grasslands consists of grasses, which can vary in height from a few inches to over 15 feet, depending on species and environmental conditions. Some common grasses found in tropical grasslands are elephant grass, bluestem, and various species of lovegrass. 2. Trees: Scattered trees, often with flat crowns and deep roots, are also commonly found in tropical grasslands. These trees are usually deciduous, meaning they lose their leaves during the dry season to conserve water. Acacia, baobab, and eucalyptus trees are some examples of trees that can be found in these ecosystems. 3. Shrubs and Forbs: In addition to grasses and trees, tropical grasslands also support various species of shrubs and forbs. These plants are adapted to the alternating wet and dry climate of tropical grasslands and often have deep roots and other strategies to survive during the dry season. 4. Epiphytes and Climbing Plants: Some plants have adapted to the tropical grassland environment by living on or climbing up trees and larger shrubs. Examples include orchids, ferns, and lianas (woody vines). Overall, the plant life in tropical grasslands exhibits a substantial amount of biodiversity due to the diverse range of adaptations necessary for survival in an environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. Additionally, the presence of both grasses and trees in these ecosystems allows for a complex array of plant communities, supporting a rich variety of wildlife."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2.

Summarize this article: The deal proposes that the merged company will maintain Allergan's Irish domicile, allowing Pfizer to escape relatively high US corporate tax rates. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential candidate, accused Pfizer of avoiding its \\"fair share\\" of taxes. The deal would \\"leave US taxpayers holding the bag\\", she said. Senator Bernie Sanders, another Democratic hopeful, said the deal would be a disaster for consumers and allow another major US company to hide its profits overseas. Democratic representative Rosa DeLauro was also critical, saying: \\"We cannot continue to allow Pfizer and other corporations to pretend that they are American while reaping the benefits this country has to offer, yet claiming to be another nationality when the tax bill comes,\\" she said. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump described Pfizer's departure from the US as \\"disgusting\\", adding: \\"Our politicians should be ashamed.\\" If approved, the deal would be the biggest example of so-called inversion, where a US firm merges with a company in a country with a lower tax rate and moves its headquarters there. In Ireland, the corporate tax rate is 12.5%, compared with the 35% Pfizer currently pays in the US. Pfizer boss Ian Read said the savings from the deal would give it \\"the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and more therapies to more people around the world\\". Last year, Pfizer made a takeover move for rival AstraZeneca, which analysts said was designed to reduce Pfizer's tax bill. The UK drugs firm rejected the bid. The White House has so far declined to comment on the deal. But US President Barack Obama has previously called such inversion deals unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice. Last week, the US Treasury Department unveiled new rules to clamp down on inversions, but tax experts said the change would not be sufficient to prevent the deal completing. Yet, investors appear uncertain the deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval in the US and Europe, will get the go-ahead.

Here is a news article: Former Star journalist Natasha Stoynoff says Donald Trump sexually assaulted her while she was writing a feature about his and Melania's first wedding anniversary. ( Twitter image ) A Toronto-based professor and writer is backing former Toronto Star journalist Natasha Stoynoff who has accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in 2005, while she was on assignment for People magazine. Paul McLaughlin says Stoynoff is telling the truth — and that her story hasn’t changed since she first told him about it shortly after the alleged attack. “The reason I’m speaking about this — and it is with her blessing, by the way — is that she is being accused by a man running for the presidency of the United States of being a complete liar, of fabricating a story about something that for her was quite horrible,” he said. Stoynoff did not respond to the Star’s requests for comment. “Now (Trump’s) got to say that I’m a liar, too, and I’m not. I’m telling the truth,” said McLaughlin, who recalled Stoynoff being deeply disturbed by her encounter with Trump. Article Continued Below “It really shook her and she didn’t know what to do, and among the people that she would turn to, I was one that she would call and ask for advice and that’s what she did,” said McLaughlin, a former journalism professor at Ryerson University who now teaches at the York University. McLaughlin said he told her not to go public with her accusation at the time, in order to protect her career. “Here he is with his very pregnant wife in an adjacent room; he is not the type of person who is going to admit what he did. And I thought that because there was no evidence other than her word versus his word that he could easily turn around and accuse her of hitting on him and he could destroy her career,” McLaughlin recalled. RELATED: Woman says Trump sexually assaulted her at a Manhattan nightspot in the ’90s Donald Trump responds with fury to sexual assault allegations A look at Donald Trump’s accusers “What saddens me more is that someone of Donald Trump’s prominence is waging war against a young, talented, writer and saying things he knows are 100-per-cent wrong,” he said. “He knows he is not telling what happened accurately and I just … it seems to be a pattern with him.” On Wednesday, Stoynoff published her story online in People. She wrote that when travelling to visit Donald and Melania Trump to write a feature about the couple’s first wedding anniversary, Trump “shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat.” Stoynoff wrote that Melania, who was pregnant at the time, was changing upstairs in preparation for a photo shoot. Trump has denied the allegations and tweeted a suggestion that the story was made up: “Why didn’t the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the ‘incident’ in her story. Because it did not happen!” he wrote. McLaughlin said Stoynoff, who was a student of his when he taught journalism at Ryerson University, called him, upset, shortly after it happened , and that he stayed in touch with her over the years. This week, Stoynoff is one of several women who have gone public with allegations that Trump sexually assaulted them. This follows a leaked video from 2005 that show Trump bragging about groping and kissing women without their consent. McLaughlin didn’t know Stoynoff was going to go public with her story before she did this week, but said he recognized her story when he read it. He said it is the same as the one she told him years ago. “I think that it’s terrible that she had to go through that. That someone who she thought admired her work turned on her that way, and destroyed what was a good professional relationship,” McLaughlin said. “Not only do I have compassion for Natasha but for anyone who has gone through this in their life.” McLaughlin said if he could go back in time, he’d stand by what he told Stoynoff. He thinks she made the right choice in no longer covering Trump. In her published account of what happened, Stoynoff said she only told a few close friends and family about her experience in Mar-a-Lago. “In time, I chalked it up to one of the hazards of a roller-coaster ride of celebrity journalism: I’d danced barefoot in Cannes with John Travolta, sang with Paul McCartney, talked about Bogie with Bacall, quoted Shakespeare with Brando and Prince Andrew yelled at me until I cried,” Stoynoff wrote. “Oh, and Donald Trump forced himself on me. I tried to make myself believe it was no big deal. “Now he’s running for president of our country.” Correction – October 17, 2016: This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly said Paul McLaughlin is currently a professor at the University of Toronto.

Among them is a friend who was with Stoynoff when she ran into Melania Trump later in N.Y.C. The wife of the Republican nominee denies meeting Stoynoff after the attack, but Stoynoff’s friend Liza Herz remembers being there during the chance meeting. Get push notifications with news, features and more. “They chatted in a friendly way,” Herz, who met Stoynoff in college, says. “And what struck me most was that Melania was carrying a child and wearing heels.” Stoynoff’s story, which made national news when it broke last week and is reprinted in this week’s issue of PEOPLE, describes a run-in with Trump when she was covering him and pregnant wife Melania on assignment for PEOPLE in December 2005. “We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat,” she writes. Trump vigorously denies the story and later attacked Stoynoff on the campaign trail, saying, “She lies! Look at her, I don’t think so.” Stoynoff describes meeting Melania later year: “I actually bumped into Melania on Fifth Avenue, in front of Trump Tower as she walked into the building, carrying baby Barron. ‘Natasha, why don’t we see you anymore?’ she asked, giving me a hug.” Natasha Stoyoff (second from left) with Donald Trump and Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago with the PEOPLE photo crew in December 2005 // Troy Word Troy Word Natasha Stoynoff for PEOPLE // Melanie Acevedo Melanie Acevedo In a CNN interview with Anderson Cooper on Monday, Melania denied the encounter ever took place. “The story that came out in PEOPLE magazine, the writer she said my husband took her to the room and started kissing her, she wrote in the same story about me that she saw me on Fifth Avenue, and I said to her ‘Natasha, how come we don’t see you anymore?’ I was never friends with her, I would not recognize her,” she told CNN. PEOPLE Editor in Chief Jess Cagle says in a statement about Stoynoff’s piece, “In this week’s issue of PEOPLE (which hits newsstands in New York on Wednesday), we feature a story that includes named sources who can corroborate Natasha Stoynoff’s account – including one woman (a friend of Natasha’s) who was actually with her when she bumped into Melania Trump on Fifth Ave., as outlined in her story.” Watch the full episode of People Features: Why I Spoke Up About Trump, available now on the new People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN).

Five other witnesses also back up Stoynoff’s account of her encounter with Trump: Marina Grasic, who has known Stoynoff for more than 25 years, says she got a call from her friend the day after the attack. Stoynoff detailed everything about the attack, from Trump pushing her against a wall to the business mogul showing up at her massage appointment the following day, she says. According to Grasic, her longtime friend was embarrassed and even thought of Trump’s then-pregnant wife when deciding not to come forward about the encounter. “Natasha was also struggling about not hurting pregnant Melania if the story came out,” Grasic says. “Beyond just the attack, she was horrified by the vulgar circumstances under which she was attacked and propositioned to have an affair. She was there in a professional capacity, writing an article about their happy marriage, and after the incident Trump acted like nothing happened. “She was particularly concerned that if he was capable of such behavior, what else was he capable of? Certainly character assassination by a powerful man was of great concern to her, which seems warranted in light of what Trump is saying about her this week. She ultimately decided to stay quiet but be taken off the Trump beat.” Stoynoff’s former journalism professor, Paul McLaughlin, says that the writer called him in tears looking for advice the very night of the harrowing encounter. However, he cautioned her to remain quiet in fear of how Trump may retaliate. Gregory Pace/FilmMagic Gregory Pace/FilmMagic “She wasn’t sure what she should do,” McLaughlin recalls. “I advised her not to say anything, because I believed Trump would deny it and try to destroy her.” “It was tough decision but in a he said/she said we believed she would lose,” the professor said in a tweet regarding the incident. “He seemed rather nasty at the time.” PEOPLE East Coast Editor Liz McNeil was one colleague Stoynoff confided in about the incident. McNeil remembers the day she returned from the assignment in Florida to cover Trump and his wife’s first anniversary. “She was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall,” says McNeil. She adds, “The thing I remember most was how scared she was. I felt I had to protect her.” Deputy East Coast News Editor Mary Green returned to PEOPLE’s New York-based staff in December 2005 after a three-year hiatus excited to reconnect with Stoynoff. However, Stoynoff was haunted by her recent experience, and she opened up to Green about the encounter. “In an early conversation we had in her office, she told me about what happened with Donald Trump,” Green said. “She was shaky, sitting at her desk, relaying that, ‘He took me to this other room, and when we stepped inside, he pushed me against a wall and stuck his tongue down my throat. Melania was upstairs and could have walked in at any time.’ “She talked about her shock, and wondered why it had happened, if she had done anything wrong. I assured her she hadn’t. She was also angry that he had forced himself on her, that she was glad someone had interrupted him, because he was surprisingly strong.” Another coworker who knew about the attack was Liza Hamm, who was friends with McNeil and others in a “tight-knit group” that Stoynoff opened up to. “Natasha has always been a vivacious person who wants to believe in the best of people, and this experience definitely messed with that outlook,” Hamm says. “But she is also a consummate professional. She told me that she asked to be taken off the Trump beat, but she tried her best to move past the experience and continue to do her job well.” Stoynoff says she knew she was opening herself up for criticism when she decided to share her story, but she’s staying strong. “I am doing okay,” she says in the new issue of PEOPLE. In the past week, multiple women have come out with similar claims of sexual assault against the 70-year-old Republican presidential candidate. Stoynoff admits there’s a chance Trump simply pushed her own incident from his mind. “It’s possible he just doesn’t remember it,” Stoynoff says. “It was over 10 years ago and I assume I am one of many, many women.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Former Toronto Star journalist Natasha Stoynoff has accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in 2005 while she was on assignment for People magazine, covering the first wedding anniversary of Donald and Melania Trump.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two neighboring countries had health epidemics. While Ghana had a measles problem, Niger had a very serious HIV problem that seemed to get out of control. But I can use this background: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ . What is an answer for this question: Which country had more people at risk of getting AIDS? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer the question of which country had more people at risk of getting AIDS, let's consider the factors mentioned in the background information provided and the given situation. Step 1: Analyze the given situation Ghana is facing a measles problem, while Niger is having a very serious HIV problem that seems to be getting out of control. Step 2: Understand the transmission of HIV HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, including blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It can also be passed from mother to fetus. Step 3: Estimate the populations at risk within each country To determine which country had more people at risk of getting AIDS, we must consider the populations affected by the respective epidemics within each country. Since we do not have specific numbers for each country, we can use the given information to make an educated assumption. Given that Niger is currently experiencing a very serious HIV problem that seems to be getting out of control, we can assume that a significant portion of the population is at risk of getting AIDS. On the other hand, Ghana is primarily dealing with a measles outbreak rather than an HIV epidemic. Thus, the percentage of the population at risk of getting AIDS in Ghana may be lower, based on the information provided. Step 4: Compare risk levels in each country Based on the information provided and the relative severity of the HIV epidemic in Niger, it is reasonable to assume that the population at risk of getting AIDS is higher in Niger than in Ghana.

Question: suppose less air pollution produced happens, how will it affect more owls see rodents. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"More Air pollution can significantly impact the ability of owls to see rodents, which form an essential part of their diet. If there is less air pollution produced, it will improve the overall visibility for owls and enhance their ability to spot and hunt rodents effectively. First, let's understand the relationship between air pollution and owls' vision. Air pollution, particularly in the form of particulate matter, can scatter light, making it difficult for owls to see their prey clearly. This is especially true in low light conditions, which is when owls are most active, as their specially adapted eyes allow them to see better at night. With reduced air pollution, the air will be less dense with particulate matter, thereby reducing light scattering. The improved visibility will provide several benefits to the owls in their hunting process, as mentioned below: 1. Increased visibility while scanning for prey: Owls typically sit at high points in trees and look around for prey, such as rodents. With less air pollution, the owls will have a wider and more transparent field of view, increasing their chances of spotting a rodent. 2. Enhanced tracking ability: Once an owl spots a rodent, it needs to track the movement of the rodent. Reduced air pollution allows the owl to follow the rodent with greater clarity and precision to time its attack accurately. 3. More successful swoops: When the rodent is standing still or moving slowly, the owl swoops down to catch it. Improved visibility ensures that the owl can better judge its swooping trajectory, thereby increasing the chances of a successful capture. 4. Less energy expenditure: With more successful hunts, owls will need to expend less energy searching for and capturing prey, which would also have a net-positive effect on their overall health and population. In conclusion, if less air pollution is produced, it will have a positive effect on owls, as they will be able to see and catch rodents more effectively.

Before you cat lovers all get upset about this remark, let me explain. According to Bailey the majority of cat behavior is rather simple, basic needs for safety, exploration, food, etc. Cat behavior is also rather simple: tail up or down, rub off scent, etc. This makes portions of the book repetitious.

This genus belongs to the family Ursidae, which includes a variety of bear species. Ursus is derived from the Latin word for \\"bear\\" and it currently features eight living species that showcase a diverse range of adaptations, sizes, and distributions across the world. Ursus originated during the late Miocene epoch, approximately 5 to 10 million years ago. Since then, the genus has evolved and adapted to different environments, leading to the varied species we see today. Among these species, you can find prominent members such as the American black bear (Ursus americanus), the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), and the brown bear (Ursus arctos). The grizzly bear is a subspecies of Ursus arctos and is often referred to as the North American brown bear, as it is native to the continent. It ranges from Alaska down to the western parts of the United States and Canada. They are omnivorous creatures with an impressive ability to survive and adapt to different habitats. Grizzly bears can be found in forests, alpine meadows, coastal areas, and even arctic tundra environments. Grizzly bears are distinguishable from other Ursus species due to their physical characteristics and behavior. They have a distinct hump on their shoulders that is primarily composed of muscle, as well as a concave facial profile and longer, straighter claws compared to those of the American black bear. Grizzlies are typically larger than black bears, with adult males weighing from 300 to 860 pounds (135 to 390 kilograms) and females weighing between 200 and 450 pounds (90 to 200 kilograms). In terms of behavior, grizzlies are quite adaptable, proficient swimmers, and skillful hunters. Their diet is diverse, including a wide variety of plants, berries, insects, fish, and mammals (such as moose, elk, and deer). They are also known to be resourceful, utilizing carrion as a food source when available. This adaptability has contributed to their survival in a range of environments and habitats. In conclusion, the genus of the grizzly bear, Ursus arctos, is Ursus. This genus features a diverse range of bear species that have adapted to different environments across the world. Grizzly bears, as a subspecies of Ursus arctos, showcase unique characteristics and behaviors that set them apart from other members of their genus and underline their status as powerful and adaptable creatures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Eleven rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza on Thursday, a day after a fatal terrorist bombing in Jerusalem killed a woman and wounded more than 50 other people, the Israel Defense Forces said. \\"The question is why,\\" Brig. Gen. Yossi Kuperwasser said in a phone call Thursday, speaking about the increase in attacks, which the IDF said caused no injuries. Israel's ambassador to the United States said Thursday the rocket attacks appear \\"unrelated\\" to Wednesday's bombing in Jerusalem. Michael Oren said the rocket attacks probably have to do with infighting in the Hamas-controlled territory of Gaza. However, he said, there has also been an escalation in violence against his country. \\"Israel has been under attack on several fronts,\\" Oren said, also citing the recent murder of an Israeli family in the West Bank. One of the rockets fired Thursday hit near the southern Israeli town of Ashdod, and another landed in the southern town of Sderot, causing damage to an industrial area of the town, according to Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. In response to the rocket attacks, the Israeli military launched airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday night. Two were in the Beit Hanoun area of northern Gaza and two were in Gaza City, according to journalist Ibrahim Dahman. A Hamas building and a Hamas training camp were hit, he reported. Kuperwasser said Thursday night's strikes were aimed at trying to prevent more attacks on Israel. \\"Right now there is no one in Gaza to stop this, so it's up to us to try to stop it,\\" he said. \\"It seems no one speaks for the Palestinians,\\" he added. \\"Hamas is not in charge.\\" There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Jerusalem attack, which was caused by a medium-sized device in a bag that had been left near Jerusalem's central bus station as the evening rush hour began. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs named the woman who died as Mary Jane Gardner, a 59-year-old British national who was studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Israeli officials were continuing their investigation into Wednesday's attack, Kuperwasser said, without giving details. U.S. President Barack Obama called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to express his condolences over the Jerusalem bombing and his concern about the attacks against Israel from Gaza, the White House said in a statement. Obama \\"reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to Israel's security,\\" it said. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates also paid a visit to Israel on Thursday. He met with his Israeli counterpart, Ehud Barak, who said Israel will not \\"tolerate\\" terrorist attacks. British Foreign Secretary William Hague also spoke out against the attack, calling it \\"a callous and disgusting act of terrorism directed against innocent civilians which I condemn unreservedly.\\" The Palestinian Authority also condemned the attack, but Oren, the Israeli ambassador, criticized their comments. They \\"say one thing\\" and \\"do another thing,\\" he said. He said prominent members of the Palestinian government recently attended a ceremony at a central square near Ramallah that was named after a \\"Palestinian terrorist who killed dozens of Israelis, including about 13 children.\\" \\"The message gets out that killing Israelis is a good thing,\\" Oren said. \\"We need to see not just words, but deeds.\\" CNN's Charley Keyes, Michal Zippori, Paul Colsey, and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.

Let's think of this like we're just moving blocks around. So, we have blocks on both sides of the equal sign, right? On the left side, we have -72541 blocks of the letter 'c'. And on the right, we have -74144 blocks of 'c' and some extra 176330 blocks. So, the first thing we want to do is to have 'c' boxes on just one side. To do this, let's take -74144 blocks of 'c' from the right side and put it on the left side, making it +74144 because when we move it across the equals sign, things change sign (minus becomes plus and vice versa). So the left side will now have -72541 'c' + 74144 'c' = 1603 'c' (because 74144 - 72541 equals 1603). As for the right side, we are only left with the extra 176330 blocks. So now we have 1603 blocks of 'c' equals to 176330 blocks. But we want only 1 block of 'c', not 1603! So, let's divide 176330 blocks by 1603. When we do that, we find that each 'c' block is around 110. So, 'c' equals to 110! We did it, good job little buddy!"},{"prompt":"- As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves - We feel the earthquake - What might be the first step of the process?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Q: What is the term for abnormally low blood levels of carbon dioxide? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The chemical reactions that regulate the levels of CO2 and carbonic acid occur in the lungs when blood travels through the lung’s pulmonary capillaries. Minor adjustments in breathing are usually sufficient to adjust the pH of the blood by changing how much CO2 is exhaled. In fact, doubling the respiratory rate for less than 1 minute, removing “extra” CO2, would increase the blood pH by 0.2. This situation is common if you are exercising strenuously over a period of time. To keep up the necessary energy production, you would produce excess CO2 (and lactic acid if exercising beyond your aerobic threshold). In order to balance the increased acid production, the respiration rate goes up to remove the CO2. This helps to keep you from developing acidosis. The body regulates the respiratory rate by the use of chemoreceptors, which primarily use CO2 as a signal. Peripheral blood sensors are found in the walls of the aorta and carotid arteries. These sensors signal the brain to provide immediate adjustments to the respiratory rate if CO2 levels rise or fall. Yet other sensors are found in the brain itself. Changes in the pH of CSF affect the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata, which can directly modulate breathing rate to bring the pH back into the normal range. Hypercapnia, or abnormally elevated blood levels of CO2, occurs in any situation that impairs respiratory functions, including pneumonia and congestive heart failure. Reduced breathing (hypoventilation) due to drugs such as morphine, barbiturates, or ethanol (or even just holding one’s breath) can also result in hypercapnia. Hypocapnia, or abnormally low blood levels of CO2, occurs with any cause of hyperventilation that drives off the CO2, such as salicylate toxicity, elevated room temperatures, fever, or hysteria.

In 1975, Sadat shifted Nasser's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of Infitah. Through this policy, incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors, but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction, abandoning Egypt's infant industries. Even though Sadat's policy was intended to modernise Egypt and assist the middle class, it mainly benefited the higher class, and, because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs, led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots. What occured in 1977?","completion":"In 1977, Egypt experienced a significant event known as the Egyptian Bread Riots, which were a series of protests and civil unrest in response to the government's decision to eliminate subsidies on basic foodstuffs. The riots occurred from 18th to 19th of January, and were driven by widespread discontent among the population, as a result of economic challenges and growing inequality in the country. The 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots took place in the context of President Anwar Sadat’s economic policy, known as Infitah or Open Door policy. This policy, initiated in 1975, aimed to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment by offering incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs. However, the investments primarily focused on low-risk, profitable ventures in tourism and construction, neglecting the needs of Egypt's infant industries. This strategy resulted in a gradual deterioration of the socio-economic situation, further widening the gap between the rich and the poor. To qualify for loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the Egyptian government was required to implement a series of austerity measures, which included the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs such as bread, flour, and cooking oil. This decision directly affected low-income families, who relied heavily on these subsidized goods to meet their basic needs. On January 18, 1977, the Egyptian government announced the removal of these subsidies, sparking immediate protests and demonstrations in major cities, including Cairo and Alexandria. The protests quickly escalated into violent riots, with people looting shops, setting fire to buildings and cars, and clashing with security forces. The unrest led to the deaths of approximately 79 people, while many others were injured or arrested. The severity of the Bread Riots sent shockwaves through both the Egyptian government and the international community, forcing President Sadat to reassess his economic policies. On January 20th, 1977, just two days after the riots began, Sadat announced the reinstatement of the food subsidies in an attempt to quell the unrest. The Egyptian Bread Riots of 1977 exposed the widening economic and social disparities in the country and underlined the urgent need for a more equitable development strategy. Though the government reversed its policy on the food subsidies immediately after the riots, the legacy of the events would have a lasting impact on Egyptian society, challenging the government's approach to economic reforms and highlighting the importance of social stability. Consequently, the Bread Riots serve as an emblematic example of the consequences of poorly planned economic policies and the precarious balance between progress and social cohesion in developing nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cnidarians are a group of simple aquatic invertebrates that include sea anemones, jellyfish, hydras, and corals. They have two main body forms: the polyp (a sessile, cylindrical-shaped body with a mouth at the top surrounded by tentacles) and the medusa (a free-swimming, bell-shaped body with a mouth and tentacles beneath). Their incomplete digestive system, also known as a gastrovascular cavity or a blind sac, serves both as a digestive and circulatory system. This means that their single opening functions as both the entrance for food and the exit for waste. The tentacles surrounding the opening contain specialized cells, called cnidocytes, which are used to capture and paralyze prey with their stinging structures, called nematocysts. Here is a brief overview of other mentioned organisms: - Annelids: A group of segmented worms such as earthworms, leeches, and marine worms. They have a complete digestive system with a separate mouth and anus. - Prokaryotes: Single-celled microorganisms that lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Emma Reynolds and Rupert Steiner. PUBLISHED:. 03:30 EST, 6 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 03:58 EST, 6 November 2012. Fat cats at Britain's top companies have defied the financial crisis and awarded themselves pay rises that take average earnings to £4million. While their basic salaries have remained roughly the same, FTSE-100 company bosses have benefited from an enormous 27 per cent increase in income thanks to incentive schemes. News of their sky-high earnings will frustrate ordinary workers struggling to cope with austerity measures while those at the top continue to enjoy a 'champagne lifestyle'. Well-off: The highest-paid executives in Britain's biggest companies are hardly feeling the pinch, thanks to incentive schemes. The steep increase, revealed by Incomes Data Services, is also likely to anger investors who have seen the value of their holdings slashed by disappointing performances at corporate giants. The value of long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) rose by an average of 81 per cent to £938,000 for directors and £1.6m for chief executives in the year to June, said the IDS report. Directors' pay increased by a median of 3.5 per cent, while the value of their bonuses fell by 4.9 per cent, the study found. But this deficit was made up by incentive schemes, which are now used by more than 90 per cent of FTSE-100 firms. LTIPs are usually granted in the form of shares and are closely linked to shareholder returns, with directors typically having to reach a minimum target before any shares are granted. Backlash: The top earners at FTSE-100 firms were Angela Ahrendts of Burberry on £15.9m, left, and WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell on £14m, right. However, LTIPs are based on comparative performance with competitors, rather than a company's historical performance, so directors may be paid even if their company's performance has worsened, IDS revealed. 'Whether a reaction to Government pressure, shareholder concerns or a worse than expected business environment, it seems the brakes have been applied to the basic pay growth for FTSE-100 bosses,' said Steve Tatton of IDS. 'However, while shareholders will be pleased to see more traditional elements of pay seemingly slowing, these figures show that directors' earnings can still grow significantly as a result of a complex mix of incentives.' TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber added: 'Directors have proved that executive pay structures are not fit-for-purpose by securing another huge earnings boost, even while ordinary workers suffer flat or even falling wages. Lucrative year: Shell CEO Peter Voser, left, and CEO of Jupiter Edward Bonham Carter, right, both made £10.4m. 'An 81 per cent increase in long-term incentive plans when the economy is struggling to climb out of a double-dip recession shows just how flawed the so-called performance elements of directors' remuneration have become. 'We still have way to go to bring a sense of reality to executive pay and ensure that directors' pay is aligned with the long-term health of the company rather than simply its share price.' Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: 'While millions of working people are either without work, or having their pay frozen or slashed, Britain's boardrooms are finding even more devious ways to squeeze more cash from their companies. 'Wages for many working people have stagnated since 2003 and have fallen in real terms since the recession hit. Scalps: Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, left, and ex-Trinity Mirror boss Sly Bailey, right, left their companies in disgrace this year after rebellions from shareholders and the public. 'But the richest have continued to pull ahead. The top 10 per cent have 12 times more income than the bottom 10 per cent. Scandalously, Britain has the fastest growing income inequality compared to other developed countries. 'What is particularly sickening is that some of the companies may be performing poorly - but the cash registers are always ringing for these directors.' 'Flawed': TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said directors' pay should be aligned with the long-term health of the company. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'The Government is guilty of allowing the gap between the rich at the top and those at the bottom to grow. It has used the recession to hold down wages in the public sector and cut jobs and services, while those at the top continue to enjoy a champagne lifestyle. 'It is clearly ridiculous that taxpayers are landed with a bill of between £6bn and £7bn a year for in-work benefits because scrooge bosses are lining their own pockets.' Shareholders have fought back against excessive pay this year in an extraordinary show of strength, with the so-called ‘shareholder spring’ claiming senior scalps including Andrew Moss, chief executive of insurance giant Aviva, and Trinity Mirror’s Sly Bailey. Yet surviving senior managers are only seeing increase in their pay packets. The top earner was Angela Ahrendts, chief. executive of Burberry, which has just issued a profit warning but paid. Ahrendts £15.9m. WPP’s Sir Martin Sorrell, who suffered one of the biggest shareholder revolts on pay in recent history, was second with £14.2m. Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘At a time of biting austerity for the economy, those at the top of our biggest companies are seeing their pay continue to increase sharply compared to everyone else. ‘The gap between rewards in the boardroom and those for the rest of society has opened up to unsustainable levels. Shareholders have tried to rein in some of the worst excesses this year, but this has only been partially successful.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This article is talking about how really rich people, particularly those who are leaders of really big companies in the UK, have been giving themselves more money even when the rest of the country is going through hard times financially. This pay rise increased their average earnings to £4 million. Even though their basic salaries stayed quite the same, these big bosses from top 100 companies in the stock exchange have seen a big increase of 27 per cent in their income due to special reward plans. Some people are upset because business folks are still able to live a fancy life, drink expensive champagne, while normal workers are having a tough time. Also, some people who have invested money in these big companies are upset because they have lost money due to the companies not doing as well as expected. These special reward plans, called long-term incentive plans (LTIPs), are often given in the form of shares and are linked to the returns made by shareholders. To get any shares, the bosses usually have to reach a certain target. It is also mentioned that bosses can still get paid even if their company's performance has worsened, which might be seen as unfair by some. So, this article is mainly about a discussion on how the big bosses are giving themselves a big pay rise while many people are struggling financially during tough times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should mba really required work experience can't I prepare for cat and after btech directly apply to well known iims/xlri?","completion":"These two questions address similar concerns but do not have the exact same meaning. Let us break them down individually and compare their implications. Question 1: \\"Should I drop one year after BTech for MBA preparations?\\" This question is asking whether it's a good idea to take a gap year after completing a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree in order to prepare for pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. The focus of this question is on time management and the best approach for an individual to prepare for MBA entrance exams like the CAT (Common Admission Test). By suggesting \\"dropping one year,\\" the question implies that the asker is considering dedicating a whole year to prepare for MBA entrance exams, without pursuing any full-time work or other educational commitments during that time. Question 2: \\"Should MBA really require work experience; can't I prepare for CAT and after BTech directly apply to well-known IIMs/XLRI?\\" This question is addressing the requirement of work experience before admission into a prestigious MBA program. The asker is questioning whether it's possible to directly apply for a top MBA program like those in IIMs (Indian Institutes of Management) or XLRI (Xavier School of Management) right after completing their BTech degree. The question also subtly notes the possibility of preparing for the CAT exam while still enrolled in the BTech program, rather than taking a gap year for such preparations (as suggested in the first question). In summary, the focus of the first question is primarily on the idea of taking a gap year after completing a BTech degree specifically for MBA entrance exam preparation. Whereas the second question questions the necessity of work experience as part of MBA application requirements, and whether a student can directly apply and prepare for the entrance exams during their undergraduate studies. When comparing these two questions, we can see that they both address concerns related to the timeline and prerequisites for MBA applications. However, they differ in that the first question centers around the strategy of taking a year off for exam preparations, and the second question probes the need for work experience and the feasibility of preparing for exams during undergraduate studies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum. Aquatic life in the freshwater habitats of which area is less at risk of dying? Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.

Article: Organic food, once considered something that only health fanatics desired, is now a regular feature at most supermarkets. And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that's organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. Conventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods -- a term whose meaning varies greatly --are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Almost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \\"no-aging\\" diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people's opinion. One thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better... Question: It can be inferred from the passage that _ .

Question: Information: - The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion. - The Crab Pulsar ( PSR B0531 +21 ) is a relatively young neutron star . The star is the central star in the Crab Nebula , a remnant of the supernova SN 1054 , which was widely observed on Earth in the year 1054 . Discovered in 1968 , the pulsar was the first to be connected with a supernova remnant . The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pulsars to be identified optically . The optical pulsar is roughly 20 km in diameter and the pulsar \`\` beams '' rotate once every 33 milliseconds , or 30 times each second . The outflowing relativistic wind from the neutron star generates synchrotron emission , which produces the bulk of the emission from the nebula , seen from radio waves through to gamma rays . The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar 's equatorial wind slams into the surrounding nebula , forming a termination shock . The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly , with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp - like features that steepen , brighten , then fade as they move away from the pulsar into the main body of the nebula . The period of the pulsar 's rotation is slowing by 38 nanoseconds per day due to the large amounts of energy carried away in the pulsar wind . The Crab Nebula is often used as a calibration source in X-ray astronomy . It is very bright in X-rays and the flux density and spectrum are known to be constant , with the exception of the pulsar itself . The pulsar provides a strong periodic signal that is used to check the timing of the X-ray detectors . In X-ray astronomy , ' crab ' and ' millicrab ' are sometimes used as units of flux density . A millicrab corresponds to a flux density of about 2.4x10 11 erg s 1 cm 2 ( 2.4x10 14 W m 2 ) in the 2 -- 10 keV X-ray band , for a \`\` crab - like '' X-ray spectrum , which is roughly a powerlaw in photon energy , I ( E ) = 9.5 E 1.1 . Very few X-ray sources ever exceed one crab in brightness . - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

Imagine you have 3258 candies, and you give away 7012 candies. You end up with -3254 candies. So the equation becomes: 1610 = -447 * n - 3254 Step 2: Now let's get the numbers on one side and the \\"n\\" on the other side. To do that, we will add 3254 to both sides of the equation.

Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What is probably true about the author? Options: A.

The 1985 Japanese comedy Tampopo was publicized as not sphagetti, but what type of western?","completion":"The 1985 Japanese comedy film Tampopo was not publicized as a spaghetti western, but rather as a \\"ramen western.\\" The term \\"ramen western\\" is a play on the famous term \\"spaghetti western,\\" which referred to western films produced by Italian filmmakers during the 1960s and 1970s. While spaghetti westerns were known for their unique style, gritty settings, and often revisionist take on the classic American western, the ramen western takes on a completely new twist by focusing on Japanese culture and cuisine, particularly ramen. Directed by Juzo Itami, Tampopo is a satirical and humorous nod to classic western film tropes and combines them with a uniquely Japanese cultural emblem – ramen. The plot revolves around the titular character Tampopo (played by Nobuko Miyamoto), a widowed owner of a struggling ramen shop. She meets Goro (Tsutomu Yamazaki), a truck driver and ramen enthusiast who decides to help her improve her culinary skills and elevate her ramen shop to new heights. The film follows their journey as they strive to create the perfect bowl of ramen and explores various themes such as food, love, friendship, and the quest for excellence. As a ramen western, Tampopo incorporates several elements from the traditional western genre, such as lone heroes, showdowns, and an emphasis on justice and honor. However, it cleverly replaces cowboys and gunslingers with ramen masters and culinary experts, and the wild west landscape with the bustling world of Japanese ramen shops. The film showcases the art of ramen making and draws viewers into the meticulous process behind creating a delicious and memorable dish. Additionally, Tampopo is noted for its non-linear narrative structure, as the main storyline is interspersed with various comedic, sensual, and dramatic vignettes that revolve around food and its significance in people's lives. These scenes range from a gangster and his mistress experimenting with food erotically, to a dying mother cooking one last meal for her family, to a business etiquette lesson where the trainees defy their teacher's sushi-eating instructions.

It was very cold and I was thinking of doing something that can raise my body temperature . Well, now I think I should have chosen doing exercise over porn . The mood was set, wi-fi speed was good and Google search was working. It took me half an hour to select a porn video. After selecting the video I downloaded it . WTF where are my earphones. Took 15 minutes to locate my earphones. The movie began and just after 5 seconds the door bell rang and this was where I got screwed when I forgot to minimize the movie. My parents were back home and I was back to my studies and just forgot about the movie. Now I have a habit that while I am studying I keep the phone in the next room. My mother was in the same room where the phone was. Now comes the worst part when my phone received a whatsapp message and my mother saw that message was dropped. Without giving any damm to my privacy she opened the phone and it was my bad luck that there was no screen lock. The movie automatically started and after 5 seconds she took the phone to my dad she said “This is what he is doing when he's alone” My parents called me what is this ?? I said it's a video message from the company and it starts automatically. I have nothing to do with that stuff and suddenly my dad said yes he is right, it's a video from the company and asked me to delete the video.

In some countries, because the man realizes that the traveler is tired and eager to reach his destination , he will politely say \\"Just down the road.\\" He thinks this is more encouraging, gentler, and therefore the wanted answer. So the American drives through the night, getting more and more angry, feeling \\"being tricked\\". He thinks the man on purpose lied to him, for obviously he must have known the distance quite well. Had conditions been reversed , the American would have felt he was \\"cheating\\" the driver if he had said the next town was not too far, and if he would be sorry to the weary driver, he would say \\"You have a good way to go yet, it is at least fifteen miles.\\" The driver might be disappointed, but he would know what to expect. Whether to be accurate or polite leads to many misunderstandings between people of different cultures. If you know the situation in advance, it is sometimes easier to recognize the problem. We can learn from this passage that Americans _ . A) are polite to anybody B) like to be honest and accurate C) often lie to others D) have no sympathy to others","completion":"From this passage, we can learn that Americans prefer to be honest and accurate (Option B) in their interactions with others, especially when providing information or directions. This cultural preference for accuracy and honesty stems from their belief that it is better to set realistic expectations and provide useful information. However, individuals from other cultures might prioritize politeness and providing an encouraging response, which can lead to misunderstandings between people with these differing cultural values. The passage presents a scenario where an American asks a local individual for directions to the nearest village. The local person, prioritizing a polite response, tells the American that the village is \\"just down the road\\" despite the fact that the distance is actually much further. In the passage, this response is perceived as dishonest, and the American becomes increasingly frustrated as they continue to drive without reaching their destination. If the roles were reversed, the passage suggests that the American would feel like they were \\"cheating\\" the driver if they were to provide a vague or dishonest answer. Instead, they would opt to be honest about the distance, admitting that the destination is \\"at least fifteen miles\\" away. Although this response might leave the driver feeling disappointed, they would at least have a clear understanding of what to expect in terms of distance, avoiding the frustration that comes from feeling misled. The main theme here is the differences in cultural preferences when it comes to communication. Americans value honesty and accuracy, while people from other cultures may prioritize politeness and encouragement. Understanding these cultural variations can help alleviate misunderstandings and foster more effective communication between people from different backgrounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An investigation into an Oklahoma dentist accused of potentially exposing patients to disease confirmed one case of patient-to-patient hepatitis C transmission, health officials said Wednesday. A total of 89 of W. Scott Harrington's patients tested positive for hepatitis C, but at this point only the one case has been directly tied to his dental practice in suburban Tulsa, officials said. Four cases of HIV were also found in his patients; the CDC is conducting genetic testing to determine whether those cases are tied to the dental office. \\"This is the first documented report of patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis C virus associated with a dental setting in the United States,\\" state epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. \\"While dental procedures are generally safe, this reinforces the importance of adhering to strict infection control procedures in dental settings.\\" Scores of Tulsa dental patients tested for hepatitis,","completion":"HIV, and other blood-borne diseases were left in shock after discovering the extent of the potential exposure, emphasizing the critical nature of maintaining a high standard of safety protocols and hygienic practices within dental facilities. The impact of this outbreak on the patient population has been significant, leading to increased vigilance and demand for accountability in dental practices across the region. State health officials and professional associations have consequently been prioritizing the implementation of mandatory infection control guidelines, routine inspections, and continuous education efforts as key measures to prevent such incidents in the future. Ongoing investigations by health authorities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlight the importance of maintaining accurate record-keeping and thorough sterilization processes for dental instruments, as well as consistent monitoring of dental health care personnel for adherence to proper infection control procedures. In response to the Harrington case, dental associations are advocating for stricter regulations on the use of disposable items, more rigorous sterilization protocols for reusable instruments, and increased transparency when communicating potential risks to patients. Furthermore, health experts are recommending additional training for dental professionals in the identification and management of potential disease transmission events. Such training would encompass various aspects, including patient history assessments, measures to prevent cross-contamination, and proper waste disposal practices. By equipping dental staff with the knowledge and tools to mitigate the risks of disease transmission, patients can be reassured of the safety and quality of the dental care they receive. Public awareness campaigns are also being launched to educate the general population about the importance of safe dental practices and to encourage patients to actively assess and inquire about the cleanliness and sterilization methods being used in their dental care facilities. Patients hold a crucial role in ensuring their well-being by remaining vigilant and advocating for higher safety standards in the dental industry. The unfortunate transmission of hepatitis C in this Oklahoma dental practice underscores the essential need for consistent compliance with established infection control guidelines across the dental industry. This incident serves as an alarming reminder that even routine procedures can have potentially severe consequences when dental professionals exhibit negligent behavior. In the wake of this incident, stringent measures must be adopted, and patients are urged to take an active role in demanding adherence to infection control standards to mitigate the risks and ensure the continued safety of dental practices nationwide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Analyze each possible answer: - Canada: This is an unlikely choice since Canada is a close ally of the US, and there has never been a significant military conflict between the two nations. It is very unlikely that the US would drop bombs on Canada during a war. - Afghanistan: This is a more likely choice since Afghanistan was a significant battleground during the US-led War on Terror, which began in 2001. The US military conducted numerous bombing campaigns in Afghanistan, targeting terrorist organizations and their infrastructure. - Aircraft: This answer is irrelevant as the question is looking for a location where the bombs are dropped, not the medium used for dropping bombs. - Arsenal: This term refers to a collection of weapons or military equipment, not a location. Therefore, this choice cannot be correct. - Suitcase: This option isn't relevant to the situation as it is not a location where bombs would be dropped. 3.

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\"When Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25, 1966, he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on Blonde on Blonde's first side. With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: \\"At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension.\\"\\"One of Us Must Know\\" is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: \\"I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't have to take it so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad.

In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of 11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate.\\" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \\"Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.\\" Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with...

What happens there in the days ahead will have enormous consequences for the U.S. and its role in the Middle East. By Peter Macdiarmid, Getty Images Cairo: Protestors in Tahrir Square on Tuesday. By Peter Macdiarmid, Getty Images Cairo: Protestors in Tahrir Square on Tuesday. If Americans don't care yet, they should. Egypt, after all, is not just any country. It is America's closest Arab ally and the first to have made peace with Israel. The U.S. has depended on the Mubarak regime to advance a number of key security interests, from countering Iran to combating terrorism. It's clear now that the regime's days are numbered. Over the past week, the streets of Egypt have been flooded with people demanding a new government and, in essence, a new way of life. What will a political vacuum in Egypt mean for security and stability in the broader Arab world? Western officials have expressed fears of another Iran, with a Western ally being lost to Islamic fundamentalism. Perhaps a democratically elected government, reflecting widespread anti-Israel feeling, will reassess the Camp David peace treaty of 1979. And what about the oil-rich Persian Gulf countries? If they, too, find themselves embroiled in a struggle with restive populations, then the free flow of oil — long a top U.S. foreign policy priority — could be undermined, with drastic consequences for the global economy. The growing uncertainty has led to a regional stock market crash, rising oil prices and other economic damage. Though President Hosni Mubarak's announcement Tuesday night that he won't seek re-election momentarily calmed things, clashes between his supporters and the crowds in the streets ushered in new unease. This is a critical moment not just for Egypt but also for America. Not only are our interests at stake, but so are our ideals. We might be seeing a pan-Arab democratic revolution. But because of its longtime support of Mubarak, the U.S. faces the hard task of midwifing a transition while staying arm's-length from the waning regime. The Arab world had always been the \\"democratic exception,\\" an authoritarian region in a world of growing freedom and democracy. Now events in Egypt could mark a definitive turning point. The crisis has entered its final phase. Though Mubarak has blinked, his insistence on hanging on until the September elections has been rejected by the thousands in the streets. The military, which receives 1.3 billion in U.S. military assistance, is poised to play kingmaker in this next phase but, so far, has stayed largely neutral. Considering the economic cost, as well as the cost in U.S. credibility, this paralysis cannot continue indefinitely. Regime forces are looking for ways to hold the revolution back, to run out the clock until the elections. The Obama administration, then, has the leverage to push Mubarak more quickly out the door. Up until now, though, the U.S. has been behind the curve. On Jan. 25, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton affirmed that the Egyptian regime was \\"stable.\\" A week later, the country is crumbling. This, presumably, is what happens after three decades of pent-up anger over the indignities of autocratic rule. The Obama administration has since toughened its tone, calling for an \\"orderly transition,\\" but hasn't gone as far as supporting the protesters' one key demand: that Mubarak quit now. More than a week into the crisis, the U.S. is still hedging its bets. Egypt, as the most populous and influential Arab nation, has the potential — with the help of the international community — to become a model for the region. It also has the potential to become a model for something altogether more frightening: a failed state unable to control its own people or territory. If Egypt moves toward democracy, the Obama administration will be remembered for resisting until the final moments. If Egypt reverts to chaos or refashioned autocracy, it will mark the definitive end of the \\"new beginning\\" that Obama promised during his historic Cairo address in 2009. Fortunately for U.S. policymakers, there is still time to pressure Mubarak to step down immediately. The protesters, whose signs are purposely in English, are pleading for such support. Should Americans care? Only if they care about 80 million people who yearn for freedom. Only if they care about U.S. national security interests. Only if they care about a stable Middle East. Only if bloodshed, even in a faraway land, troubles the conscience. The world is watching. Now we will find out just how much the world cares.

I read this background article the other day: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1] I am facing a new situation today: Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the information you've provided from the background article, Iceland, being located closer to the North Pole, will likely feel the effects of climate change more quickly and more drastically compared to Ecuador, which is situated near the Equator. This is because higher latitudes of the world, such as the Arctic region, are predicted to experience above-average temperatures and more significant climate alterations as a result of climate change. In contrast, the countries located closer to the Equator might experience the impacts of climate change at a slower pace and to a lesser extent.

The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness. Question: \\"What is the issue with the nave and why is the axis of the west front conflicting with it?\\" Response: \\"The axis of the east front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too narrow for its height\\" Select from the following.

Donald Trump Will Do 'Right Thing' If He Loses Ivanka Trump does not like to discuss defeat. Her father is “in it to win it,” she says, and she’s “not interested in talking about alternative outcomes.” But if the election doesn’t go to Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the fairness of the electoral process, Ivanka said in a new interview on Wednesday that her father will “do the right thing.” In an interview with TIME Editor Nancy Gibbs at the Fortune Most Powerful Women’s conference, Trump appeared calm and poised but revealed very little about her reaction to her father’s recent campaign struggles. When asked directly about her father’s “locker room” talk, his claims that the election will be “rigged” and the massive gender gap between Trump voters and Hillary Clinton voters, Ivanka Trump mostly gave answers about her closeness with her father, their family business and her own brand. The Most Powerful Women interview was her first major interview since the release of the leaked 2005 audio that revealed Trump bragging that he can “do anything” to women. When asked about the now-infamous audio, Ivanka Trump said the incident was “jarring,” but that her father had apologized. “He recognizes it was crude language, he was embarrassed that he had said those things, and he apologized,” she said. “That’s not language consistent with any conversation I’ve had with him.” She then described her father’s business prowess, calling him very much a “leader of people.” (A Fast Company article published Monday included a statement from Ivanka Trump on her father’s scandals.) She added that she has spoken to her father about his controversial comments, but did not reveal what was said in those conversations. “We talk about it, we have a very open dialogue, and I think that’s one of the things that I respect so much about him, his willingness to listen,” she said. Trump also attempted to distance herself from the campaign’s inner sanctum, saying she resented media portrayals that describe her as a “surrogate” for her father. “I’m not a surrogate, I’m a daughter,” she said. “I’m not the campaign mastermind that people like to portray.” Ivanka has played a prominent role in the campaign, introducing her father at his announcement speech, giving a major primetime address at the Republican National Convention and orchestrating her father’s child care plan. “When people ask me about politics, I talk about what a great dad he was, and what a great businessman he’s been, because that’s what I know,” she said. “Everyone else can debate policy.” Ivanka also says she has been surprised by the level of scrutiny aimed at her and her family since her father began to run for President. “I may have been naïve going into this—nothing in life prepares you for a parent running for president,” she said, before adding that “the media has been vicious.” “The bias is very, very real, and I don’t think I would have said this to you even a year ago,” she continued. “From a media perspective, it’s very hard to get an accurate portrayal of who he is as a person.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

Summarize this article: The North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust is one of nine in England found to have higher than predicted mortality rates last year. The figures include deaths in hospital, or within 30 days of discharge. North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust medical director, Dr David Emerton, said it was \\"reviewing the care of all patients who die\\". Dr Emerton said the figures - higher than expected for the second year running - were skewed by the number of patients treated without being admitted to hospital. Some patients, such as those in care homes nearing the end of their lives, where sent to hospital \\"when not much really can be done\\", he said. The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), who compiled the data, says the categorisation does not mean a hospital is failing or unsafe and does not take levels of social deprivation into account. Its figures should \\"instead should be viewed as a 'smoke alarm' which requires further investigation by the trust\\", a spokeswoman said. The SHMI is available from April 2010 and the latest data covers July 2013 to June 2014. The expected risk of the patient dying in hospital, or within 30 days of discharge, is estimated based on the patient's condition, age, sex and how they were admitted to hospital. Dr Mike Smith, from the Patients Association, said the figures should be viewed in the context of the area's poverty and unemployment rate. \\"If people have, locally, a high mortality and morbidity rate, that means to say people are dying more than the rest of the nation and/or are sicker than the rest of the nation, then you mustn't necessarily think it's the hospital's fault,\\" he said. Summary:","completion":"A hospital called North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust had more people pass away than they thought would last year. The people in charge are looking into why this happened. They think it might be because some very sick people are being sent to the hospital even though there isn't much that can be done to help them.

However, we can examine the reviewer's sentiment and analyze the text to provide an informed assumption. The reviewer expresses gratitude by saying \\"Thanks\\" and finds the update necessary. This indicates that they had a positive experience, as they are appreciative and benefited from the changes. However, the review lacks specific details and is very brief. Considering this information, we can assume that it falls somewhere in the middle to high range of ratings. To provide a more detailed analysis, let's evaluate different potential ratings: - ★ (1 Star): Highly unlikely, as the reviewer expressed gratitude and found the update useful. - ★★ (2 Stars): Unlikely, given the positive sentiment mentioned above. - ★★★ (3 Stars): Possible, as the review could indicate that the update was necessary but may not be exceeding expectations. It could also mean that the review was intended to be neutral but expressed light positive sentiment. - ★★★★ (4 Stars): Likely, as the reviewer seems pleased with the update and its necessity.

NEW YORK (CNN) -- The Great Depression is in full swing. Gangster Al Capone is sentenced to 11 years behind bars for tax evasion. Dick Tracy debuts in the comics. The George Washington Bridge opens. The old subway cars have concrete floors, overhead fans and open windows. The year is 1931. And New Yorkers are stepping onto the brand new R-1 model subway car, built by the American Car & Foundry factory in Berwick, Pennsylvania. Fast-forward 77 years. New Yorkers and tourists are once again boarding these 84,000-pound, 60-foot-long behemoths constructed of riveted steel, with some featuring wicker seats, dangling emergency brake cords, incandescent light bulbs, big exposed overhead fans, and open windows. \\"You come on a","completion":"nostalgic journey back in time when you step aboard these vintage R-1 model subway cars,\\" says Michael Glikethe, a New York transit historian. \\"It's a completely different experience from riding today's modern and sleek subway trains.\\" As part of the New York Transit Museum's ongoing efforts to preserve the city's transportation history, these R-1 model subway cars have been meticulously restored to their original condition and are now on display for the public to admire and enjoy. Occasionally, the museum even offers rides on these antique trains, allowing passengers to relive a bygone era of the New York City subway system. The restoration process was no small task, as each component of the subway cars had to be carefully examined, repaired, or replaced to maintain their historical authenticity. In addition, safety features were updated to meet current standards without interfering with the vehicles' classic appearance. \\"The R-1 model subway cars are a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the American Car & Foundry factory,\\" says Janelle Bronson, the museum's director. \\"They represent an important chapter in New York City's transportation history and offer a fascinating glimpse into the daily lives of New Yorkers during the Great Depression.\\" The R-1 model subway cars may be a far cry from the air-conditioned, Wi-Fi-enabled trains of today, but they remain a symbol of New York City's enduring spirit and resilience during one of the toughest times in the nation's history. New Yorkers and visitors alike can appreciate the distinctive charm of these vehicles while reflecting on the city's past and progress throughout the decades."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Welcome to the world of multitasking -- a place where the measure of a person is how many jobs they can perform at the same time. In fact, if experts are to be believed, multitasking is a disastrous idea. One of the opponents of multitasking is Dr. Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University. \\"People who multitask frequently are less able to pay attention; they're worse at managing their memory.\\" he said. In his opinion, the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless in some situations, for example, part of doing business in the digital world: but you can't do serious work like writing, thinking or solving an important problem this way. You do worse even as you think you're doing better. All the time the research points to a simple fact: the brain cannot cope. When you stop midway through composing a report to check an email, you force your brain to stop and regroup. It is like pressing the pause button during a movie, meaning the film takes longer to watch. And as for Dr. Nass, the problems extend beyond the brain. Young people who frequently multitask are not as socially and emotionally healthy as those who don't. They just feel more emotionally satisfied and the feeling is so good and they are bound to desire it again. Todd Oppenheimer, a writer said \\"We've become a very short-term society and don't reward people for taking a lot of time on something.\\" He fears we may end up losing the next generation of great thinkers. \\"It's really unfortunate because the long-term challenges of our world -- environmental issues, financial issues -- require people to think wisely about the long-term consequences of what they do. And it's no coincidence that the kind of people who do think long-term don't multitask.\\" A:","completion":"Based on the article, which of the following statements is true regarding multitasking?

A: A:","completion":"Given the lack of information in the paragraph provided and to answer the question accurately, I must presume the missing context is related to the reproductive process. All gymnosperm species and many eudicot species undergo double fertilization. In these plants, the reproductive process involves the production of male and female gametes, followed by the fusion of the male sperm nucleus with the female egg cell, resulting in the development of a seed. In gymnosperms, this usually occurs in cone-like structures, while in eudicots, it happens within flowers. During double fertilization, two sperm nuclei from the pollen grain enter the ovule – one fertilizes the egg cell, forming a zygote, which eventually develops into the embryo. The other sperm nucleus fuses with two polar nuclei within the central cell, forming a triploid endosperm nucleus. This endosperm nucleus later gives rise to the endosperm, a nutritive tissue that provides sustenance to the developing embryo. So, all gymnosperm species and many eudicot species undergo double fertilization as part of their reproductive process."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Kim studied a 15000 year-old settlement, before humans invented agriculture, while Harry studied a 5000 year-old village. and a hint : Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Please answer this question : Which student studied about a village that had a more dependable food supply? A:","completion":"Harry Step 1: Understand the given situation and hint The situation presents two students, Harry and Kim, who studied ancient human settlements. Kim studied a 15,000-year-old settlement (before agriculture was invented), while Harry studied a 5,000-year-old village. The hint states that agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago, providing a more dependable food supply and enabling people to settle in villages and cities. Step 2: Compare the students' subjects of study Since Harry studied a 5,000-year-old village, his subject falls within the time frame when agriculture was already invented (10,000 years ago). In contrast, Kim studied a 15,000-year-old settlement, which predates the invention of agriculture. Step 3: Determine which student studied a village with a more dependable food supply Given that agriculture provided a more dependable food supply and allowed for the formation of villages, Harry's 5,000-year-old village would have a more dependable food supply than Kim's 15,000-year-old settlement.

When Scott stops for gas and refreshments, he encounters Tom Wilson (Hutchins), who is on his way to take a job as a waterskiing instructor at a Miami hotel.

Ten years later, Max's brother volcanologist Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is visited by Max's son, Trevor's 13-year-old nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson). In a box of items that belonged to Max is a book, Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. Notes written by Max are found inside the book. In Trevor's volcanology laboratory, a device shows activity on SnÃ¦fell, a dormant volcano in Iceland. Trevor and Sean travel to Iceland to investigate. They try to contact Icelandic volcanologist SigurbjÃ¶rn Ãsgeirsson, but instead encounter his daughter Hannah Ãsgeirsson (Anita Briem) since her father had died some years earlier.[3] It turns out that SigurbjÃ¶rn and Max were both Vernians, a group of people who believe the works of Jules Verne to be fact and not fiction. Hannah offers to help them climb the volcano. While the group is hiking up the volcano, a lightning storm forces them to take shelter in a cave. The cave entrance collapses, having them trapped in what appears to be an abandoned mine. The trio then rides on out-of-control mine carts, in which the tracks start to branch-off in three ways. Hannah and Trevor get saved from dead-ends and Sean reunites with them. They reach the bottom of a volcanic vent, the floor of the vent breaks, and they begin to fall towards the center of the Earth. The volcanic vent eventually becomes a water slide which drops them safely into a lake in the center of the Earth, which turns out to be a completely separate world contained within the Earth.

Arsene Wenger has backed Jack Wilshere to take the World Cup by storm after revealing the Arsenal star’s rehabilitation from a broken foot will ensure he is in peak condition for England this summer. The 22-year-old has not played since suffering a hairline fracture to his left foot during England’s friendly against Denmark on March 5 — an injury that appeared to threaten his participation in Brazil. But Wenger says the midfielder is likely to return for Arsenal’s clash with West Bromwich on May 5 and that he has already assured England manager Roy Hodgson he should have no worries about naming the playmaker in his squad. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Wilshere and Neymar star in the new Nike ad. On the mend: Jack Wilshere will go to the World Cup in peak condition, according to Arsene Wenger. Ouchy! The Arsenal playmaker has not played since breaking his foot in an international friendly against Denmark. ‘Jack started to jog again this week and I would say two to three weeks until he returns to action,’ said Wenger. ‘I spoke with Roy Hodgson, I told him Wilshere will be available for England. He will be just polished for England. ‘I think he will pick him. I didn’t feel any doubt on that front. Jack can prove himself to be world class at the World Cup. He can be the positive surprise. Pep talk: Wenger has told England manager Roy Hodgson that Wilshere will be polished for the World Cup. ‘England has a very difficult group but if you come out of a group like that your belief is really strong. They have to deal really well with the situation as they have Italy and Uruguay in the group and they have to get out of there.’ Wenger also believes Wilshere is ready to put his long run of injuries behind him and show his consistency next season. A long-term ankle problem meant he did not make a single appearance during the 2011-12 season and just 35 for club and country the following campaign. Yet Wenger says Wilshere has learned a lot during his lay-offs and is adamant he will prove his doubters wrong when he gets a run of games. Stuttered: Wilshere has had a stop-start season after a succession of niggling injuries. ‘He has been stop-start this year and last season,’ he said. ‘I think we have sorted out the problem and I hope from now on he will be always available. ‘I hope he has stabilised now. We have seen with Lionel Messi recently, who is the best player in the world, that being in and out is the most difficult thing to deal with as you need to be competitive and to do that you need to be playing. ‘He is a football man, Jack. You speak to him about something in the game and he understands straight away. He has a natural football understanding. Not much in it: Wenger insists that Arsenal have not fallen behind Liverpool, despite the league table. ‘He watches the game and analyses very well what happens. While they are injured, these players learn, of course. I think he learns from watching the games, from the problems you can face in the game.’ And Wenger has refuted suggestions Arsenal have fallen behind Liverpool this season, saying that the Reds’ lack of European football has helped them while his side have only struggled due to injuries. ‘We beat them twice this season and they also benefited from a season when they played only the Premier League. I do not think if you take the injuries, plus all the competitions we played in and compared it to Liverpool you cannot say we are miles behind them.’","completion":"This is a story about a soccer player named Jack Wilshere, who hurt his foot playing in a game.

(CNN) -- Ten years after the end of its civil war, Angola, which is heading to the polls Friday, has been transformed into a regional African power with a strong economy, but poverty is still widespread. Angola experienced double digit growth in GDP annually in the period 2002-2008. In the last five of these years, average annual growth was at 17%, which more than doubled the size of the economy. The country is the second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, and the third biggest economy, after South Africa and Nigeria. Do these tremendous growth rates mean that Angola has escaped the so-called resource curse, where oil resources are detrimental to growth?

However, a large portion of the population still struggles with access to basic needs such as healthcare, education, and safe drinking water.

Let's break down the two statements in detail: 1. \\"One of the band members is playing his trombone.\\" This statement establishes that a specific band member is playing a trombone. It provides information about the musical instrument being played (trombone) and indicates that the person playing it is part of a band. However, it doesn't provide any information about other musicians within the same band or what instruments they are playing. 2. \\"A man is playing the clarinet.\\" This statement refers to a person (a man) playing a different musical instrument (clarinet). There is no direct link or connection between this statement and the first one. For example, the man in question could be part of another band, a solo artist, or from the same band mentioned in the first statement, but it doesn't necessarily follow that if the trombonist is playing, the clarinetist must also play. It is entirely possible that a man might be playing the clarinet in the same band as the specified trombonist, or in a different scenario altogether. However, the presence of a trombone player does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the presence of a clarinet player. To make such an assumption, additional information and context would be necessary.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Individuals with a history of being physically or emotionally abused, especially as children, are more prone to suffer from IED, as are those suffering from a personality disorder or other serious mental illnesses. IED may also be linked with repeated traumatic experiences of violence or stress, such as the traumas experienced by active-duty military personnel. Other mental illnesses are sometimes linked to IED include personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and disorders associated with disruptive behavior, such as attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Just because an individual displays one or more of these risk factors does not mean they suffer from IED. However, the presence of risk factors in addition to the characteristic symptoms of IED, explosive episodes of rage, should be cause for concern. Everyone finds themselves feeling or expressing anger from time to time, and it's perfectly healthy to do so. Rage, on the other hand, is a destructive emotion that can cause us to act in ways we normally would never think to. While anger may influence the way we behave while experiencing it, rage seems to utterly command our behavior and thought, leaving no room for anything else. Explosive episodes seem to come out of nowhere. An IED sufferer may find themselves in a steady, or even pleasant mood, conducting their daily business when, without warning, they find themselves overwhelmingly angry, displaying uncontrollable, violent behavior. While explosive episodes are most likely to occur in private, often after dark, their unpredictable nature means that they may sometimes occur in places where loud or highly visible expressions of anger are inappropriate, such as at work or in public places. Sufferers of IED often become extremely violent, or even abusive, during their explosive episodes. Seemingly tiny arguments or frustrations can lead, in the blink of an eye, to extraordinary and uncharacteristic displays of physical and emotional cruelty. These displays are usually very sudden in their onset, making them unpredictable and dangerous for everyone involved. Common examples of violent behaviors linked to IED include: Shouting or screaming, even though the person being spoken to is not raising their voice. Invading personal space, often by stepping close and getting \\"in the face\\" of those nearby. Throwing, hitting, or breaking objects. Shoving, grabbing, or hitting others. Intentionally hurting oneself, such as by slapping or punching, beating one's head against a wall, etc. Name-calling, or use of language intended to hurt or insult others. Threatening others with violence. While the specific behaviors displayed by an IED sufferer during an explosive episode may vary, they are always characterized by being disproportionate, or \\"way over the top\\", relative to the circumstances or events triggering the episode. A true explosive episode can last for several hours before it dissipates naturally. After an extended episode of rage, the sufferer is likely to feel exhausted, and relieved that the episode has ended. Later, the sufferer may feel intense remorse, shame, and unease while thinking about the things they said and did while experiencing their explosive episode. These feelings can lead the sufferer to become depressed, irritable and removed An IED sufferer will also often experience much shorter episodes, during which they might momentarily \\"snap\\" at someone in conversation, becoming suddenly verbally or physically hostile before returning to normal. Episodes occur irregularly, with gaps of days, weeks or even months in between. Only a medical expert can diagnose someone with IED, or any other mental illness. Your first step, if you suspect that you or someone you know is suffering from IED, should be to consult with a psychiatrist, councilor or medical doctor about the symptoms and risk factors which are bothering you. Once any anger issues have been diagnosed, you and your doctor can begin exploring options for treatment. Summary:","completion":"The article examines Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), a mental condition characterized by sudden episodes of extreme anger that are disproportionate to the situation, which can include violent or abusive behavior. The piece emphasizes that IED sufferers may have a history of physical/emotional abuse or serious mental illness such as personality disorders, and the condition can also be associated with recurrent violent stress or traumas, like those experienced by military personnel. It illustrates the unpredictable nature of IED episodes, often occurring without any obvious triggering event, in which sufferers exhibit aggressive behaviors such as shouting, invading personal space, causing physical harm to themselves or others, and threatening violence. The article also explains that sufferers often feel remorseful and emotionally drained after these episodes, which can further lead to depression and isolation. Additionally, they may experience shorter episodes where they momentarily display hostility before returning to their normal state. The recurrences of these episodes are irregular, with varying gap periods. The article asserts the importance of seeking a medical expert's opinion if IED is suspected to initiate the appropriate treatment following a proper diagnosis. It further emphasizes that not every individual displaying the described risk factors and symptoms necessarily suffers from IED, but their presence should raise concern. The article ends by reiterating our common experiences with anger and differentiating them from the destructive emotion of rage which dominates the behavior of individuals with IED, leaving no scope for any other emotion or thought."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. and the situation: The southern province was exposed to intensive grazing for many years , and now soil quality is poor and dust storms are present. The northern province has more fertile soil, more trees. Answer the following question: Which province experiences more carbon loss? A:","completion":"Based on the given background and situation, the southern province experiences more carbon loss. This can be inferred from the information provided about the degraded land and its impacts on biodiversity, soil quality, and the associated economic losses. In the southern province, the land has been exposed to intensive grazing for many years, which has resulted in poor soil quality and the presence of dust storms. These factors suggest that the soil in this region has experienced significant degradation, making it less capable of retaining essential nutrients such as carbon. The text explicitly mentions that carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau (a likely analog for the southern province) results in substantial economic losses. This implies that degradation, which is occurring in the southern province due to intensive grazing, leads to higher carbon loss. On the other hand, the northern province has more fertile soil and more trees. The presence of trees suggests better overall ecosystem health and a higher capacity for carbon sequestration. Trees, in general, act as carbon sinks, absorbing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This means that the northern province's more abundant tree cover would result in less carbon loss compared to the southern province. In conclusion, the southern province, with its poor soil quality, intensive grazing history, and the presence of dust storms, experiences more carbon loss compared to the northern province, which has more fertile soil and a greater number of trees."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Who runs Beerfest?

Upon arrival, they find themselves immersed in a high-stakes world of beer games, hilarious competitions, and a legendary rivalry. Behind it all stands the enigmatic and charismatic organizer, Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen. As they delve deeper into the world of Beerfest, the friends learn that the event originated hundreds of years ago as a form of rebellion against the ruling families of Germany, led by Baron Wolfgang's ancestors - the Wolfhausen family. The Barons of the Wolfhausen clan created Beerfest in order to raise funds for their secret society, dedicated to overthrowing the oppressive nobility and establishing a new order of freedom and fairness. However, in recent decades, Beerfest has lost its value and has turned into a self-serving party filled with debauchery for the current Baron. As the competition unfolds, Jack, Lucy, Mike, and Sarah shine in the beer games and attract the attention of Baron Wolfgang himself. He reveals that his family had long ago made their fortunes in America through beer brewing, and in fact, the four friends are long-lost relatives of the von Wolfhausen family. The Baron sees their exceptional beer-game skills as an opportunity to bring purpose back to Beerfest. Over time, the friends learn that the recent Barons of Wolfhausen, including Wolfgang, have grown greedy and corrupt, abandoning the original noble principles of the festival. Dissatisfied with the current state of Beerfest, the friends decide to reform the event, reestablishing it as a platform for raising awareness and funds for social issues, and restoring the original vision of the founding von Wolfhausen ancestors. The climax of the movie unfolds as Jack, Lucy, Mike, and Sarah challenge Baron Wolfgang to a legendary beer tournament, wagering control over the festival. If they win, Beerfest reverts to its initial purpose of making the world a better place, while if they lose, they'll leave Beerfest and never return. After an intense showdown, the friends ultimately prevail, revealing that they have been working with an underground organization to expose the Baron's corrupt practices. In the end, the friends rally together with the Beerfest attendees, renewing the Wolfhausen legacy and transforming the festival into a force for good.

What reviews supported this critic consensus?","completion":"Several reviews supported the critic consensus of Neil LaBute's update of \\"The Wicker Man\\" being puzzlingly misguided, struggling against unintentional comedy, and ultimately failing. Some of these reviews were published in well-known newspapers, magazines, and online platforms, demonstrating that the general sentiment towards the film was widely negative. Here are some examples: 1. Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times: In his review, Ebert called the movie a \\"deranged\\" version of the original 1973 film, questioning most of the creative choices made by LaBute. He expressed frustration with the plot's lacking coherence and emphasized that much of the intended suspense and drama came across as unintentional humor. 2. Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian: Bradshaw described \\"The Wicker Man\\" remake as \\"lamentable,\\" comparing it unfavorably to Robin Hardy's 1973 original. He criticized the acting, particularly Nicolas Cage's performance, and pointed out that the film's attempts at psychological terror often resulted in laughter from audiences. 3. Manohla Dargis, The New York Times: Dargis expressed disappointment in the film, citing its diminished horror when compared to the original movie. She noted that the film's story lacked expansiveness and depth, and took issue with the casting of Nicolas Cage, whose performance was often absurd and cartoonish. 4. James Berardinelli, ReelViews: Berardinelli echoed the consensus that \\"The Wicker Man\\" remake was a failure, finding fault in the adaptation of the original's nuanced plot to a Hollywood-style production. He critiqued the film's confusing narrative and poor pacing, adding that the resulting unintentional humor detracted from its intended horror theme. 5. Scott Foundas, LA Weekly: Foundas labeled the film a \\"travesty,\\" detailing the struggle to identify a single element in the new adaptation that surpassed its predecessor. He took particular issue with the screenplay, remarking that the characters and dialogue lacked any sense of believability or logic. These reviews, along with several others, were instrumental in shaping the overall critical consensus of \\"The Wicker Man\\" as puzzlingly misguided. The film was widely panned for its lack of narrative coherence, unintentional comedy, and weak performances, failing to live up to the impact of the original 1973 movie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The given text is a passage from the Old Testament in the Bible, specifically from the book of Daniel. To make the passage more readable, I added spaces between the words. The passage now reads: \\"And the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven.\\" This passage is taken from Daniel 8:8, which is a part of Daniel's vision of a ram and a goat. In this vision, Daniel sees a powerful he-goat with a prominent horn between its eyes. The goat becomes very powerful and dominant, but at the peak of its strength, the great horn is broken. In place of the broken horn, four other horns grow, pointing towards the four winds of heaven. These events are believed to represent historical occurrences and the rise and fall of specific kingdoms. To provide some context, the book of Daniel is traditionally placed within the context of the Babylonian exile (605-539 BCE), when the southern kingdom of Judah was conquered, and its elites were exiled to Babylon. Daniel is one of those exiles who serve in the court of the Babylonian king and later under the Persian rulers. Biblical scholars have interpreted the passage in different ways. Some of them believe that the he-goat symbolizes the empire of Alexander the Great, who conquered the then-known world and defeated the Persian Empire. The breaking of the great horn can be interpreted as the death of Alexander the Great at the height of his power and success. The emergence of the four other horns represents the division of Alexander's empire into four kingdoms after his death. These kingdoms were ruled by his generals, also known as the Diadochi. The four winds of heaven, in this interpretation, represent the geographical directions to which the four generals expanded their respective territories. In conclusion, the passage in its original form had all the words connected, making it challenging to read. By adding appropriate spaces, the passage from Daniel 8:8 becomes much more legible and provides insight into a prophetic vision of a he-goat and its broken horn, symbolizing historical events relating to powerful kingdoms and their rulers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Seven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near Ãksfjord. The cabin is owned by Sara, Vegard's girlfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by StandartenfÃ¼hrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog and Michael Schwab, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream.

Mixture brew two cups of boiling water. Insist in a thermos 6 hours, filter and spray the apartment. Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"To effectively follow your task, you need to create a herbal mixture that you will brew in boiling water, let it steep in a thermos for six hours, then filter it and spray the mixture around your apartment for the desired purpose (freshening the air, repelling insects, or a similar goal). Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this: 1. Select the herbs and ingredients: Determine the purpose of the mixture – whether as a room freshener, insect repellent, or for another specific usage. Research and choose the appropriate herbs and natural ingredients that will provide the desired effect. For example, if you want a refreshing room scent, you may choose herbs like lavender, eucalyptus, or mint. For an insect repellent, consider using ingredients like citronella, lemongrass, or rosemary. 2. Prepare the herbs: After deciding on the suitable herbs or ingredients, gather and measure the needed quantities. Chop or crush them to release their oils and fragrances. You may also consider drying the herbs first to preserve them for future use and concentrate their properties. 3. Boil water: Measure two cups of water and bring it to a rolling boil in a kettle or pot. It must be extremely hot to properly steep the ingredients and extract their beneficial properties. 4. Combine boiling water and herbs: Carefully and quickly pour the boiling water over the prepared herbs in a heat-proof container. Stir the mixture gently to ensure that all the ingredients are equally submerged. 5. Transfer the mixture to a thermos: Pour the hot herbal blend into a thermos and seal it tightly. This will help retain the heat during the infusion process. 6. Steep the mixture for six hours: Allow the herbs to steep for six hours to ensure that the water absorbs all the necessary oils, fragrances, and other beneficial properties from the herbs. 7. Filter the mixture: After six hours, open the thermos and carefully strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or a piece of cheesecloth to separate the liquid from the herb particles. You may discard the used herbs. 8. Prepare your spraying device: Fill a clean spray bottle with the filtered herbal mixture. Be sure to select a suitable bottle with an adjustable nozzle that allows you to control the force and direction of the spray. 9. Spray the apartment: Proceed to spray the herbal mixture around your apartment as desired. Make sure to cover all the necessary areas and surfaces, depending on your intended purpose. For example, if you aim to repel insects, be sure to spray the mixture near doors and windows to discourage insects from entering your home. Following these steps should result in a successfully brewed and sprayed herbal mixture that suits your specific purpose. Remember to store any leftover mixture in a sealed bottle or jar for future use, and clean your spraying device thoroughly after use."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Very handy and useful\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

It was first announced by Bill Gates on 1 August 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for a bundled set of applications, the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. On 10 July 2012, Softpedia reported that Office is used by over a billion people worldwide. - Redmond is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located east of Seattle, within the Seattle metropolitan area. The population is 60,560 in 2016, an increase from the 2010 census, up from 45,256 in 2000 census. Redmond is commonly recognized as the home of Microsoft and Nintendo of America. With an annual bike race on city streets and the state's only velodrome, Redmond is also known as the \\"Bicycle Capital of the Northwest\\". - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function. - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system. - Internet Explorer (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer, commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a discontinued series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included as part of the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows. - Robert Alan Soloway is the founder of the so - called \`\` Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam , '' or SPAMIS , but is said to be one of the Internet 's biggest spammers through his company , Newport Internet Marketing ( NIM ) .

The word is also used as an informal shorthand term for some crimes against property, such as burglary, embezzlement, larceny, looting, robbery, shoplifting, library theft, and fraud (\\"i.e.\\", obtaining money under false pretenses). In some jurisdictions, theft is considered to be synonymous with larceny; in others, theft has replaced larceny. Someone who carries out an act of or makes a career of theft is known as a thief. The act of theft is also known by other terms such as stealing, thieving, and filching. - Consumer electronics or home electronics are electronic or digital equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, paper shredders, etc.). In British English, they are often called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from \\"white goods\\" such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians. - Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's identity, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name, and perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss. The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences if they are held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term \\"identity theft\\" was coined in 1964. - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play. - A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An \\"information resource\\" is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court. - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies. - In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud itself can be a civil wrong (i.e., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud and/or recover monetary compensation), a criminal wrong (i.e., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities) or it may cause no loss of money, property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, such as obtaining a driver's license or qualifying for a mortgage by way of false statements. - Terrorism financing refers to activities that provides financing or financial support to individual terrorists or terrorist groups. A government that maintains a list of terrorist organizations normally will also pass laws to prevent money laundering being used to finance those organizations. - Grand jury is a legal body empowered to conduct official proceedings and investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may compel the production of documents and compel sworn testimony of witnesses to appear before it. Grand jury is separate from the courts, which do not preside over its functioning. - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. \\"This shows that there are some bubbles in Chinese real estate market,\\" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities. Furthermore, it should be noted that American people's average income is several dozen times higher than that of Chinese people. How can the Chinese afford to buy a house which is even more expensive than that sold in the US? At the beginning of 2007, Chinese government issued a set of policies that aimed to benefit the public. Now in order to reduce the high housing prices, the government can regulate the real estate market by raising tax on property industry and controlling the release of loans and lands to property developers. Meanwhile, the government should allow people to build more houses through various fund-raising channels, such as funds collected from buyers or raised by working units. By applying these multiple...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Talk to the girl about where she feels comfortable going. Choose a location where the girl will likely feel comfortable, such as your home or a hotel room. Make sure you'll be alone and uninterrupted while you're hooking up. For instance, you might take her to your home or you might ask to go back to hers. If you can't take her home, you could rent a hotel room or arrange to go to a friend's home. Consent is essential when you’re hooking up. Don’t assume that she wants to have sex just because she agrees to be alone with you. Pay attention to her words and body language to see if she’s into it. When in doubt, ask her directly if she wants to have sex. Signs she’s into it include smiling, initiating kissing and physical contact, asking you to do sexual things to her, and getting close to you. Signals she’s not into it include pulling away, looking away from you, and changing the subject. You could just ask, “Do you want to have sex?” or “Do you want to take this to the bedroom?” Hooking up can be super fun, but it’s important to avoid potential complications. Talk to the girl before you become intimate to decide what kind of protection you'll use. Ask her if she is currently on birth control pills, has received a birth control shot, or has an intrauterine device (IUD) to prevent pregnancy. Additionally, wear a condom or dental dam to protect you against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Even if the girl is on birth control, it’s typically best to use a barrier form of protection to protect against STDs anyway. Start by kissing her on the hand, arm, or cheek. Then, give her a passionate kiss on the lips. If you’re both into it, kiss her in other intimate places, like her neck, breasts, or thighs. Go slow at first. Give her a light kiss and gauge her reaction. Don’t use tongue when you first start kissing her. Build up to it so she doesn’t feel like you’re rushing things. She’s going to be more interested in a hookup if she feels sexually excited. Don’t rush things by trying to start intercourse too soon. Instead, take your time to caress her, kiss her body, and rub against her. This will help her get into the mood for sex. For instance, start by gently caressing her body. Then, move from kissing her lips to making a trail of kisses down her neck, chest, stomach, and thighs. Simply shift her clothing or remove it as you go. Don't just get up an leave after a hook-up. Instead, talk to the girl to make sure she enjoyed it. Then, clean yourself up and get dressed. If you're at her place, thank her for having you over before you leave. If you're at your place, offer to help her get home safely. If you've gotten a hotel room, ask her if she'd prefer to stay overnight or go home. Both your and her experience will be better if you part on good terms. Show her that you care about her health and well-being by helping her get home. Offer to drive her home or to call her a ride if she can't drive herself home. If she's got her car and feels comfortable driving herself home, walk her to her car and ask her to text when she gets home. If you stay the night together, talk to her before you fall asleep so you both understand each other's expectations for the morning after. For instance, decide if you're both okay with the person who slept over leaving without waking the other. While you might not be interested in a relationship, it's still important to be kind to the girl you hooked-up with. Tell her that you enjoyed meeting her and had a good time. Additionally, ask her if she had a nice time so she feels like you care about her. You might text, \\"It was great meeting you last night! I had a great time and hope you did, as well.\\" You don't have to have a long conversation with her. However, sending a check-up text shows her that you don't just see her as an object.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of communication and consent when approaching a hookup. It suggests choosing a comfortable location for both parties, such as a home, hotel room, or a friend's place, ensuring privacy and uninterrupted time together. Consent should never be assumed, and it is vital to pay attention to verbal cues and body language. If unsure, directly asking for consent helps maintain a clear, respectful understanding. Among other things, discussing protection and birth control methods prior to getting intimate is essential to avoid potential complications. Furthermore, the article suggests taking the time to build up excitement by slowly progressing from light physical contact to more intimate actions rather than rushing into intercourse. After the hookup, it's important to check in with one another to ensure that both parties enjoyed the experience. Parting on good terms, addressing each other's health and well-being, and assisting with transportation are significant steps that show kindness and consideration, even if there is no intention of pursuing a relationship. Lastly, sending a follow-up text emphasizes that the other person is more than just an object and instills a sense of respect and conscientiousness for the encounter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Brink has recently taken Pud's (Bobs Watson) parents in an auto wreck. Brink later comes for Gramps. Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the crotchety old Gramps orders Mr. Brink off the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or apparition. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can. Pud's busybody Aunt Demetria has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spends much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy. Brink takes Granny Nellie in a peaceful death just after she finishes a bit of knitting. When Mr. Brink returns again for Gramps, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is.

(CNN) -- Washington's relentless focus on crisis tends to cloud its ability to see great opportunities. With more than 40 African heads of state coming to Washington this week for three days of meetings with President Barack Obama, Cabinet officials, members of Congress and American business leaders, the United States has a real opportunity to jump-start what has been a slow evolution in the way we have engaged with Africa. It's an opportunity that should not be missed. Foreign assistance is no longer America's primary export to Africa, and our engagement needs to change, too. The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit is an opportunity to showcase and strengthen a relationship that is evolving dramatically on economic, security and development fronts. Africa will emerge as the next great growth market and opportunity of the 21st century, and China will not miss \\"the next","completion":"Asia.\\" The United States must recognize and seize the moment to build stronger economic partnerships, enhance regional and global security, and support sustainable development in Africa. The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit is the perfect platform to demonstrate and solidify America's commitment to the continent, paving the way for a new era of collaboration and shared prosperity. In the past, the United States' focus on Africa has often been limited to providing foreign aid and humanitarian assistance. While these efforts are crucial in addressing critical challenges like poverty, disease, and hunger, they do not alone foster the long-term, sustainable development that Africa needs. To truly harness Africa's potential, the United States must broaden its approach, engaging with the continent as a strategic partner rather than simply a recipient of aid. One key area where this shift must occur is in trade and investment. The United States must work to increase its presence in Africa's rapidly expanding markets, which are projected to boast some of the fastest-growing populations and middle classes in the coming decades. Africa's consumer spending is expected to reach 2.1 trillion by 2025, offering immense opportunities for American businesses across sectors from infrastructure and energy to technology and agriculture. By investing in African businesses and forging commercial partnerships with African entrepreneurs, U.S. companies can tap into this burgeoning market and create mutually beneficial relationships that contribute to the continent's economic growth and job creation. Furthermore, improving digital connectivity and expanding access to technology is crucial for Africa's development in the 21st century. The United States can play a leading role in bridging the digital divide by working with African governments and private sector partners to increase internet access, promote digital literacy, and foster innovation. By helping African countries leverage technology to support sectors like education, healthcare, and financial services, the United States can contribute to Africa's ongoing digital transformation and enable the continent to leapfrog over some developmental barriers. On the security front, as Africa continues to grapple with issues like terrorism, organized crime, and ongoing conflicts, the United States must deepen its security cooperation with African governments and regional organizations, providing training, equipment, and intelligence support to help build resilient security institutions. By working with African partners to establish robust security networks, the United States can not only contribute to the continent's stability but also safeguard its own national security interests by curbing the spread of extremist ideologies and transnational criminal networks. Finally, the U.S.-Africa partnership should focus on empowering the next generation of African leaders and entrepreneurs through capacity-building programs, educational initiatives, and cultural exchanges. The United States has a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be shared with Africa, and promoting the right policy frameworks, institutional development, and good governance will be essential for unleashing the full potential of Africa's human capital. In conclusion, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit is a pivotal opportunity for the United States to reevaluate and reshape its relationship with Africa, moving beyond the traditional focus on foreign aid. By embracing a more comprehensive and strategic approach that includes trade and investment, technology, security cooperation, and people-to-people ties, the United States can foster a new era of shared growth, development, and partnership with Africa – and ensure it does not miss out on the vast economic and geopolitical opportunities the continent offers in the 21st century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Dead Space was the only album released by Omaha , Nebraska natives Slowdown Virginia . Released by Lumberjack Records ( which later became Saddle Creek ) in 1994 , the album was pressed in a small amount of copies ( aimed at the local scene without expecting a much larger fan base ) . Shortly after the release of the album , Slowdown Virginia broke up . Most the members went on to form Cursive , who have since become major contenders in the indie rock circuit , making Dead Space a major collector 's item .

The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - Slowdown Virginia was an indie rock band from Omaha, Nebraska. Formed in 1993, the band recorded and released one album, \\"Dead Space\\", on Lumberjack Records in 1994, the predecessor to today's Saddle Creek Records. After playing an influential role in inspiring the later formation of other Omaha bands like Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Desaparecidos with their energetic live shows and recordings, Slowdown Virginia broke up in the spring of 1995. A month after breaking up, Kasher, Maginn, and Pedersen regrouped with a new drummer to form Cursive. Omaha's mixed entertainment venue Slowdown is named in honor of the band. - The Faint is an American indie rock band. Formed in Omaha, Nebraska, the band consists of Todd Fink, Jacob Thiele, Dapose, Joel Petersen and Clark Baechle. The Faint was originally known as Norman Bailer and included Conor Oberst (of Bright Eyes, with whom the Faint toured in 2005). He quit shortly after the band was formed, though the Faint continued to share a spot with Bright Eyes on Saddle Creek Records. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska. Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship, the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 (as Lumberjack Records). Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel. The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha, and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst (then a solo artist, currently of Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk), Tim Kasher (then of Slowdown Virginia, currently of Cursive and The Good Life), and others. Collectively, they were known unofficially as the \\"Creekers\\". Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer, offering to \\"Spend an evening with Saddle Creek\\" (later to be the title of the label's DVD.) Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship. Distribution is handled by the Alternative Distribution Alliance, which is under the Warner Music Group umbrella. - Omaha is the largest city in the state of Nebraska and the county seat of Douglas County.

Coming off two straight road losses to an NFC North team, the Bills returned home for a rematch with the New England Patriots. In the first meeting in Week 1, New England came back to win, thanks to late-game struggles by the Bills. This time, however, it wasn't even close. In the first quarter, the Patriots took an early lead with the first of Corey Dillon's two runs, an 8-yarder.

(CNN)With crews from around the world aiding in the search, 30 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of AirAsia Flight QZ8501, Indonesian officials said Friday. What appears to be a piece of the fuselage was found, Singapore's Defense Ministry said. It resembles a window panel. Finding the fuselage and the plane's \\"black boxes\\" are a priority, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said Friday. There are 59 teams of divers involved, the agency's chief Bambang Sulistyo said, according to the state-run Antara news agency. The USS Sampson, the U.S. Navy ship that is helping with the search, recovered some of the bodies, the U.S. Seventh Fleet said Friday. Indonesian authorities have identified four of the recovered bodies so far. The first victim they identified, an Indonesian woman named Hayati Lutfiah Hamid, was buried Thursday. Many family members are waiting in Surabaya for news about their loved ones. But with 162 people on the plane when it took off from Surabaya, Indonesia, crews have a long way to go. Who was on the plane. AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said he was traveling Friday to Surabaya to bring the body of flight attendant Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi home. \\"I cannot describe how I feel. There are no words,\\" he said on Twitter. The other two people identified are Grayson Herbert Linaksita and Kevin Alexander Soetjipto, Indonesian authorities said. Search efforts are concentrated in a zone covering 1,575 square nautical miles (5,400 square kilometers) that officials believe is the \\"most probable area\\" to find the remains of the aircraft. But on Friday, waves in the Java Sea as high as four meters (13 feet) were making it hard for divers search underwater. The weather is \\"the biggest obstacle,\\" said Bambang Hermanu, chief of police in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province, where much of the search operation is based. Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak. Here's more key information about where things stand on Flight QZ8501:. The flight. What we know: The aircraft took off early Sunday from Surabaya, bound for Singapore. Roughly 35 minutes into the flight, the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather. Minutes later, the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar. What we don't know: What happened on board after contact with the plane was lost. No distress call was received. Indonesian aviation authorities have suggested that the plane ascended despite permission being denied because of traffic. Some experts have speculated that the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. Analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position, or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines. Until the main wreckage of the plane is found, along with the flight recorders, experts have little evidence to support their theories. How can a modern airliner vanish? The search. What we know: Search teams found debris and some bodies 100 to 200 kilometers (about 60 to 120 miles) from the aircraft's last known location over the Java Sea, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said. What we don't know: The exact location of the body of the aircraft. An Indonesian search official told CNN on Wednesday that he thought sonar equipment had detected wreckage from Flight 8501 at the bottom of the Java Sea. But the country's search and rescue chief said the plane hadn't been found yet. Bad weather has hindered the search operation. The ones who missed the flight. The investigation. What we know: The key to understanding what happened may be in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, commonly known as black boxes. The black boxes, which are actually orange, are in the tail of Airbus 320-200s. If recovered, they will be taken to a lab in Jakarta, Indonesia, to be analyzed, said Tatang Kurniadi, head of Indonesia's National Committee for Transportation Safety. The batteries powering the \\"pingers\\" that send acoustic signals have only about 24 days of power left, officials said. What we don't know: Where the plane's remains might have been taken by the elements. Investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage. \\"The more bits I can put into my mosaic, the better my picture will be,\\" aviation safety expert Michael Barr said. \\"The better the picture, the better I can come up with an understanding of what happened.\\" But the conditions at sea make that work much more difficult than on land. \\"In the water, you are working with currents and winds, and so the pieces won't be where they had the initial impact,\\" he said. What happens next? The plane and the pilots. What we know: The 6-year-old Airbus A320-200, operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate, had accumulated around 23,000 flight hours in about 13,600 flights, according to Airbus. The plane's last scheduled maintenance was on November 16. Flight 8501's veteran captain, Iriyanto, 53, had 20,537 flying hours, 6,100 of them with AirAsia on the Airbus A320, the airline said. The first officer, Remi Emmanuel Plesel, 46, had 2,275 flying hours, a reasonable amount for his position. What we don't know: Whether technical problems, human error or other issues were involved in the crash. According to information from the Aviation Safety Network accident database, there have been 54 incidents involving the A320. \\"In the A320 family, accidents and incidents range from fan-cowl detachment, landing gear collapse, bird strikes, right through to hull losses through pilot error,\\" said Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group. \\"Most aircraft have teething problems, and in most cases, these are eradicated. Very rarely, these issues cause disasters -- largely because of a culmination of factors that lead to the event,\\" Ray said.

It's not Miyazaki's best work, but it is leagues beyond any traditional 2-D animation out of 3-D-mad Hollywood lately, and more beguiling than anything Disney's done in ages. 2. A gorgeous, life-affirming piece whose anti-war message is particularly timely. 3. Emphatically passionate and fraught with greater meaning. 4. The visual power of Miyazaki's animation is as strong as ever, but it's all for naught when you can't make heads or tails of the story on screen. 5. Glitches in storytelling and stunt casting cannot overshadow the wondrous sights that Miyazaki doles out for our approval. 6. The story works on many levels, including as an anti-war fable, but its central theme is about the matchless power of love. 7. While there's no denying Miyazaki's visual flair and tip-top draughtsmanship, I found myself less than enchanted by the mile-high convolutions of the plot, and frankly bored by the final half-hour. 8. Miyazaki's expertise at drafting, along with his eye for detail and ability to infuse a story with heart, results in a wonderfully entertaining film. 9.

Several reviews praise the film's visual flair, animation, and anti-war message, with many considering it as a life-affirming and captivating experience. Some reviewers appreciate the movie's theming and entertaining nature, stating that it works on multiple levels, including its central theme about the power of love. However, there are also criticisms regarding the storytelling and plot. Some reviewers find the plot convoluted, the pacing choppy, and the story impenetrable, which affected their engagement and enjoyment of the film. A few even mentioned that these issues overshadowed the remarkable animation and visuals. Overall, from the listed reviews, it can be concluded that the movie has outstanding visuals and a compelling anti-war message, but its storytelling and plot may not be as effective or engaging for some viewers, leading to a mixed, yet mostly positive reception."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: Who is sacrificed by Pang ? Zhao The answer to this question is:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the main characters In order to create a movie plot around \\"Who is sacrificed by Pang? Zhao,\\" we first need to establish our main characters. In this case, we have two characters, Pang and Zhao. We can further develop these characters by giving them a backstory, personality traits, and motivations. Pang: A cunning and ambitious individual who will do anything to achieve power and success. Pang comes from a lower-class background and has always felt the need to prove himself. He is manipulative and sees people as pawns in his grand schemes. Zhao: A loyal and trustworthy friend, Zhao is the complete opposite of Pang. Kind-hearted and genuine, Zhao has always believed in the power of friendship and trust. He is intelligent and quick-witted but prefers to use his skills for the greater good rather than for personal gain. Step 2: Determine the setting The setting for our movie plot could be a sprawling, ancient kingdom filled with political intrigue, betrayals, and power struggles. This helps create an environment where our characters' motivations and actions can flourish as well as create tension in the narrative. Step 3: Outline the main events 1. Introduction: The movie starts by presenting the friendship and bond between Pang and Zhao as they grow up together in the kingdom. They both dream of rising through the ranks and making a difference in the kingdom. 2. Rising Tension: As they grow older, their paths diverge. Pang increasingly focuses on using any means necessary to gain power, while Zhao remains true to his beliefs in loyalty and trust. This tension grows as they both secure positions within the kingdom's political system. 3. The Sacrifice: In order to secure a powerful alliance and discredit potential threats to his position, Pang concocts a plot to frame Zhao for treason, setting him up as the sacrificial pawn. He manipulates events so that Zhao is accused, tried, and sentenced to death. 4. The Aftermath: Following Zhao's death, Pang achieves his goal of obtaining a position of great power in the kingdom. However, his guilt over sacrificing his once best friend begins to eat away at him. He starts to question whether obtaining power was truly worth the cost. And ultimately his ambition leads to his own downfall. Step 4: The climax and conclusion 1. Climax: Pang's position of power leads him to face grave challenges from within and outside the kingdom. His enemies use his past actions against him and expose the truth about his betrayal and sacrifice of Zhao. A revolt starts, and Pang loses everything he's built. 2. Conclusion: The kingdom is ultimately saved by a new leader, one who embodies Zhao's ideals of loyalty, trust, and selflessness. Pang, now a broken man, is left reflecting on the price of his ambition and how his greed led to his own destruction. By following these steps, we have built a movie plot around the question, \\"Who is sacrificed by Pang? Zhao.\\" The story focuses on themes of betrayal, ambition, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions, with a tragic ending that highlights the importance of staying true to one's beliefs and values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers. After reading the above, is \\"he preferred to remain standing\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Jarrah remained seated where during the takeover?\\"? Select from: [I] no; [II] yes;","completion":"I'm going to explain this to you like you're five years old. There were some bad people called hijackers who took over a plane called United 93. This happened a long time ago on a day called 9/11. One of the bad guys was named Jarrah. When the bad guys took over the plane, Jarrah was sitting in his seat. He stayed there until they got control of the cockpit, where the pilots sit. Then Jarrah went inside the cockpit. So, the correct answer to the question \\"Jarrah remained seated where during the takeover?\\" is [I] no. He did not prefer to remain standing. He stayed seated until he went into the cockpit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

On the positive side, the user is expressing their interest and excitement in upgrading and playing with a Mac Pro, a device known for its high performance and design. The use of \\"lol\\" indicates that the user is in a light-hearted mood while discussing their desire for the computer. The choice of words like \\"play\\" and \\"pennies\\" also contributes to the casual tone of the tweet, making it seem like a friendly conversation about the user's interest in technology products. However, there is also a touch of negative sentiment in the tweet. The user mentions that they'll have to \\"keep saving [their] pennies,\\" which implies that the cost of the Mac Pro is a considerable factor in their decision making and might be a source of frustration or financial stress. This suggests that the user desires the product but is aware of the financial commitment required to obtain it. In summary, the sentiment in this tweet can be characterized as a mix of positive (enthusiasm about the product) and negative (financial stress).

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -48*o - 162 = -405 - 1149 for o.","completion":"The equation given is -48*o - 162 = -405 - 1149. To solve this problem for 'o', we first simplify both sides of the equation. On the right side, you subtract 405 from 1149 to get -1554: -405 - 1149 = -1554 So the equation becomes: -48*o - 162 = -1554 Next, we isolate '-48*o' by getting rid of the '-162'. We do this by adding '162' to both sides. That will cancel out the '-162' on the left side: -48*o - 162 + 162 = -1554 + 162 which simplifies to: -48*o = -1392 Now, divide both sides by '-48' to solve for 'o'. -48*o / -48= -1392 / -48 'O' becomes: o = 29 So, the solution for 'o' in the given equation is 29."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Cyrano de Bergerac Movie plot: In seventeenth-century Paris, poet and supreme swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac (JosÃ© Ferrer) stops a play from being shown because he ostensibly cannot stand the bombastic style of the principal actor, Montfleury (Arthur Blake). An annoyed aristocratic fop, the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), provokes him into a duel by tritely insulting Cyrano's enormous nose. Cyrano first mocks his lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert could have phrased it (much to the amusement of the audience). He then composes a ballade for the occasion on the spot and recites it during the sword fight. With the last line, he stabs his opponent. Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), Captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies of his victim's friends, but he is unconcerned. When Le Bret presses him to reveal the real reason he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw his beautiful cousin Roxane (Mala Powers) being smiled at by the actor. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of it being returned because of his nose. When he receives a request from Roxane to see her in the morning, he is finally emboldened to act. Then pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan) approaches him for help. Ragueneau has learned that a nobleman he had mocked with his verses, the Comte De Guiche (Ralph Clanton), has hired a hundred ruffians to teach him a lesson. Cyrano escorts him, kills eight of the horde, and drives off the rest. The next day, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince), though she has not even spoken to him. Cyrano hides his devastation and agrees to help her. Cyrano befriends the young man and discovers that he is infatuated with Roxane, but is too inept with words to woo her.

This is the date when the Federation of Australia took place, resulting in the unification of these six separate British colonies into one nation known as the Commonwealth of Australia. Prior to this date, each colony functioned as a distinct entity with its own system of government under British control. They were established over a period of time during the 19th century, with specific founding dates for each colony: 1. New South Wales: Established on January 26, 1788, by the arrival of the First Fleet, led by Captain Arthur Phillip. This marked the beginning of British colonization in Australia. 2. Tasmania: Initially founded as a separate settlement in 1803 under the name Van Diemen's Land, it later became a separate colony in 1825. 3. Western Australia: Established as the Swan River Colony in 1829, under the command of Captain James Stirling. 4. South Australia: Proclaimed as a new British colony on December 28, 1836, by Governor John Hindmarsh. 5. Victoria: Formed as a separate colony on July 1, 1851, when its southeastern region was separated from the larger Colony of New South Wales. 6. Queensland: Established on June 6, 1859, when its northeastern region separated from the Colony of New South Wales. As the 19th century drew to a close, there was a growing sentiment among the colonies that they would benefit from unifying under a single national government. The process of the Federation of Australia was primarily aimed at achieving this unity while still retaining the individual systems of government that each colony had developed. On January 1, 1901, the Commonwealth of Australia was established, marking the onset of a new era for the former British colonies that are today known as the states of Australia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836.

Firstly, the sentence confirms that Puerto Rican farm laborers and Mexican ranchers, who belong to Hispanic groups, have settled in Hawaii since the late 19th century. This historical context demonstrates that Hispanics have been present in the Hawaiian Islands for over a century, contributing to the cultural diversity of the region. Moreover, the sentence provides quantitative data on the Hispanic population in Hawaii. It states that 7.0 per cent of the population in the Hawaiian Islands are either Hispanic or Hispanophone (Hispanic-speaking) or both. This percentage confirms the presence of Hispanics in Hawaii, with a measurable representation among the broader population. It is also worth mentioning that the data presented in the sentence not only highlights the existence of Hispanics in Hawaii, but it also showcases the linguistic aspect of the Hispanic community. The mention of Hispanophones, or Hispanic-speaking people, implies that apart from their ethnicity, these individuals speak a language originating from a Hispanic country, such as Spanish, contributing to the linguistic diversity of Hawaii.

Answer: As the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia starting on 30 December 1920, Josip Broz took on many assumed names during his activity within the Party, including \\"Rudi\\", \\"Walter\\", and \\"Tito.\\" Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: The party that was outlawed in Yugoslavia in 1920 was the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY). The Communist Party of Yugoslavia, initially called the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia (Communists), was founded on April 20, 1919, in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). The party was established as a response to the need for a unified communist movement in the newly formed country, following the end of World War I. Its primary aim was to establish a socialist state that would ensure social, economic, and political equality for all citizens. However, the ruling monarch, King Alexander I, perceived the CPY as a threat to his political power and the stability of the kingdom. The global surge in communist influence following the Russian Revolution of 1917 contributed to the growing concern about the potential destabilization caused by the communist movement in Europe. In this context, on December 30, 1920, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia decided to outlaw the Communist Party by enacting a law called the \\"Law Concerning the Protection of Public Safety and Order.\\" This law imposed severe restrictions on organizations, activities, publications, and individuals promoting communism or related ideologies. Consequently, the Communist Party and its members were forced to go underground and carry out their activities in secret. One notable figure who emerged during this period was Josip Broz Tito, who later became the President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Operating under various aliases, such as \\"Rudi,\\" \\"Walter,\\" and \\"Tito,\\" he actively participated in the illegal activities of the CPY and played a crucial role in organizing and expanding the communist movement in Yugoslavia. After years of operating in secret, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia re-emerged during World War II as a primary force in the Yugoslav resistance against the Axis powers. Following the end of the war and the collapse of the royal government, the CPY came to power and established a socialist federal state, led by Tito until his death in 1980. In summary, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was outlawed in 1920, following the enactment of a law that aimed to protect public safety and order. Despite being forced underground, the party continued to grow and ultimately became a major political force in post-World War II Yugoslavia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it.

Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt. Question: \\"How did Europeans' and Americans' attitudes toward amassing wealth differ?\\" Answer: \\"Europeans had no interest in it, while Americans desired it\\" Is this answer correct? Select from the following. I. no II. yes...I think the answer is","completion":"II. yes The answer is correct because, according to Tocqueville, Europeans did not care about making money, with the lower classes having little hope of gaining wealth and the upper classes finding it crass and unbecoming to focus on money. On the other hand, Americans desired to amass wealth through hard work and saw it as an achievable goal. The \\"no\\" answer (I) is incorrect because it contradicts the information provided in the passage about the differing attitudes towards wealth between Europeans and Americans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would crop A more likely or less likely be virus resistant than crop B? Keith is a biotech scientist. He had developed a GMO crop that he labeled as crop A. To see how his GMO crop compare with another crop he selected crop B. Crop B was a non-GMO crop. Keith needed to find the pros and cons of both crops. Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... A:","completion":"Crop A would more likely be virus resistant than crop B. The paragraph mentions that Keith, a biotech scientist, has developed a GMO crop labeled as crop A and compares it with another non-GMO crop, crop B. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have their genetic material altered through recombinant DNA technology, which significantly broadens the range of genes available to breeders when designing new crops with specific desired traits. One of the primary benefits obtained from genetic engineering is increased virus resistance, among other attributes such as enhanced durability, nutritional content, insect resistance, and herbicide tolerance. Since crop A is a GMO, it is more likely to have been specifically designed and engineered to have a higher level of virus resistance than crop B, which is a non-GMO crop. Non-GMO crops rely on traditional breeding practices, and although they can achieve virus resistance through hybridization or cross-pollination, the \\"created\\" resistance is likely to be less targeted and effective than the resistance designed through genetic engineering. It is worth mentioning that the use of GMO crops can raise food safety, food labeling, and environmental concerns. Several countries have imposed restrictions on the production, import, or use of GMO foods and crops, which underscores the ongoing debate surrounding the risks and benefits associated with GMOs. In the European Union, for instance, all GMO foods must be labeled, while the United States does not require such labeling. Despite these concerns and regulatory approaches, the fact remains that crop A, as a GMO crop, is more likely to have been designed with increased virus resistance compared to the non-GMO crop B."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The party guests, who were a group of friendly animals, gathered around to watch the funny monkey. They smiled and laughed as the monkey continued to throw the food away. Some of the animals, like Mr. Elephant and Mrs. Giraffe, decided to offer the monkey some of their favorite foods, but he still didn't like any of it. Feeling bad that her guests didn't have any food left, the wise and kind hostess, Mrs. Owl, decided to come up with a solution. She went to her special kitchen and brought out a big bowl of fresh bananas. The monkey, seeing his favorite food, jumped up and down with excitement, and the other animals clapped their hands (or paws, hooves, or wings). Mrs. Owl then showed the monkey a menu with pictures of all the different dishes she could make using bananas: banana smoothies, banana splits, and even banana sandwiches. The monkey was thrilled and chose his favorite dishes, and Mrs. Owl quickly prepared them for the party. The other animals also enjoyed the new banana dishes, realizing they had discovered a new taste that they liked. They thanked Mrs. Owl and the monkey for bringing something new and exciting to the party. The monkey, feeling happy that he made the party guests happy, decided to join the celebration. He danced and played with the animals, and they all became good friends. And so, the party continued with music, laughter, and delicious banana treats that everyone shared and enjoyed.

Die: This option is not relevant to traveling or going somewhere. Dying does not indicate any form of transportation, and hence, does not align with common sense. 3. Might fly: Flying is a common and practical means of transportation, especially for long distances or when time is of the essence. This option showcases common sense as flying allows individuals to go somewhere quickly and efficiently. 4. Might drive a car: Driving a car is another practical and popular mode of transportation.

Under the iron fist of the enigmatic leader known as The Sovereign, a group known as The Allegiance serves as the watchdog, ensuring all citizens adhere to the regime's rules and regulations. However, a secretive rebellion called The Veil has been growing under the radar, working to overthrow The Sovereign. Plot: The Veil, led by the mysterious strategist, Zara, develops a plan to free their imprisoned leader, Blake, who was captured by The Allegiance. The movie begins with the Veil executing a carefully coordinated attack on the facility holding Blake, which results in an explosion that incapacitates all members of The Allegiance, including The Sovereign and his followers. As the story unfolds, Zara and her team of rebels slowly expose the hidden truths behind The Sovereign's rise to power, revealing a twisted web of betrayal, intrigue, and manipulation. Through a series of guerilla attacks, they work to dismantle the regime's oppressive infrastructure. Meanwhile, The Allegiance desperately tries to regain control, deploying their most ruthless agents to eliminate The Veil. With the leader and his followers incapacitated due to the initial attack, The Sovereign's rule is threatened. His second-in-command, a ruthless enforcer named Vorak, captures several members of The Veil and tortures them for information, threatening to unravel their entire operation. While time is running out for The Veil, the team discovers a hidden underground facility where The Sovereign has been secretly replicating himself. The clones, each enhanced with unique skills and abilities, are being prepared to replace The Sovereign should he ever fall. Zara resolves to infiltrate the underground facility and destroy the clones, but only with the help of an insider, a conflicted allegiance agent named Finn, who has begun questioning his role in the regime. In an action-packed climax, Zara and her team confront The Sovereign and a number of his clones in the heart of the underground facility. A desperate battle ensues, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. In the end, Zara sacrifices herself in a massive explosion that destroys the clones, ultimately allowing the former followers of The Sovereign to revolt against the regime and dismantle The Allegiance. As the story closes, Blake stands on the ashes of the fallen regime, delivering a powerful speech to a crowd of newly liberated citizens. The message of hope and unity spreads, as the people begin to rebuild their society in true freedom, honoring the memory of Zara and the rebels who lost their lives in the pursuit of a better world. \\"The Veiled Rebellion\\" is a thrilling sci-fi action dystopian drama that not only entertains but also emphasizes the importance of unity, courage, and the pursuit of freedom in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, across the shores in Spain, Atletico Madrid demolished their city rivals Real Madrid with a powerful 4-0 victory in a breathtaking display of skill and determination. Body: Man City's Stuttering Form: The English Premier League match at Etihad Stadium ended in disappointment for the home team as Manchester City were held to a 1-1 draw against a determined Hull City side. The draw left City fans despondent as their team now falls seven points behind Chelsea in the race for the title. The single point gained from Saturday's draw only intensifies the pressure on Pep Guardiola's team, who have struggled to maintain consistency this season. In the end, City were left ruing missed opportunities, as they found themselves unable to break down Hull's staunch defense and steal all three points. Spanish Power Struggle: In Madrid, the tables were turned in the heated rivalry between Atletico and Real Madrid. In a fiercely contested match at the Wanda Metropolitano, Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid dominated their opponents with an incredible 4-0 win.

Given the question: Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is an upcoming role-playing survival horror video game developed by Cyanide, it is based on the short story, \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", a short story by which American writer? The answer is:","completion":"The Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is an upcoming role-playing survival horror video game developed by Cyanide, based on the highly influential short story \\"The Call of Cthulhu.\\" This iconic work was written by the renowned American writer H.P. Lovecraft, who is widely considered one of the most significant and influential authors in the horror and weird fiction genres. Born on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island, Howard Phillips Lovecraft was an American writer who achieved posthumous fame for his unique and terrifying stories that often dealt with cosmic horror. Lovecraft's work, including \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and various other tales, greatly influenced both literature and pop culture, inspiring generations of writers, filmmakers, and game developers alike. \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" was first published in 1928 in the American pulp magazine Weird Tales. It is a classic example of Lovecraft's literary style, known as \\"cosmic horror\\" or \\"Lovecraftian horror.\\" This style of horror is characterized by the notion that the universe is unknowable, indifferent, and hostile to humankind, and that getting too close to the truth would lead to madness or destruction. The story revolves around a series of notes and accounts left by a man named Francis Wayland Thurston, who is trying to uncover the truth about a mysterious cult that worships an ancient, terrifying deity called Cthulhu. As Thurston delves deeper into the story, he discovers that the cult seeks to awaken Cthulhu, who lies in a deathlike slumber beneath the ocean, and bring about the end of the world. Cyanide, the developer of the upcoming video game adaptation of \\"The Call of Cthulhu,\\" is a French video game studio that has previously worked on several other notable titles, such as Styx: Master of Shadows and the adaptation of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series into a role-playing game. The studio aims to capture the essence of Lovecraft's story and its haunting atmosphere by blending elements of traditional role-playing games with survival horror game mechanics, resulting in a unique and immersive gaming experience. Players will take on the role of a private investigator who explores the mysterious town of Darkwater Island, Massachusetts, in search of answers to a dark and unsettling mystery. The game will challenge players to confront the dark forces lurking beneath the surface of the island while managing their own sanity and making choices that will ultimately determine the fate of both themselves and the world around them. In conclusion, The Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is an upcoming role-playing survival horror video game developed by Cyanide, based on the famous short story \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" by the influential American writer H.P. Lovecraft. By combining Lovecraft's chilling storytelling, atmospheric exploration, and engaging game mechanics, the developer seeks to provide an unforgettable gaming experience that is both faithful to the original story and innovative in its approach."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The value of pollinators to the UK government is estimated to be Â£430m a year, but populations have been on the decline for 30 years. The Welsh government launched the action plan at the Royal Welsh Show in Powys in July. Since then a review has looked at the reasons for the insects' decline. The action plan will be developed in partnership with key agencies and might include changes to the planning system to help make development \\"pollinator friendly\\". Other plans include planting more bee-friendly plants in areas such as railway embankments and road verges. The Welsh government held a workshop at Aberystwyth University on Monday to share the results of its review with Friends of the Earth Cymru, the Welsh Bee Keepers' Association and wildlife trusts. Speaking before the meeting, Peter Barrar, a director of National Bee Keeping Centre Wales, said: \\"A number of policies and programmes will be put forward for discussion and hopefully we're going to have a situation where we have an action plan that (can be implemented) throughout Wales, and addresses some of the really key issues that are facing pollinators, not just in Wales, but throughout the UK as a whole and elsewhere.\\" Mr Barrar said there was probably four of five issues affecting pollinators. \\"Firstly, I think we've got problems with the loss of natural habitats which have resulted from ways in which we now manage the land,\\" he added. \\"For example, 97% of the UK's wild flower meadows have disappeared since the 1930s. That's an incredible impact due to farming practices and so on. \\"There are issues about the use of pesticides which many beekeepers believe are having a disastrous effect, on not just bees, but on other pollinators as well.\\" Environment Minister John Griffiths said 20% of the UK's cropped area was made up of pollinator-dependent crops. \\"In July I announced that Wales would produce an action plan for pollinators,\\" he added. \\"Since then a review has been undertaken in Wales to look at the reasons for the population decline and the impacts that such a decline will have upon our society. \\"We now want to share this report with our relevant partners and take their views on how we can protect this vitally important eco-system service. \\"Their views and expertise will be crucial is helping to shape this action plan which is the first of its kind in the UK.\\"","completion":"Pollinators, like bees, are very important to help plants grow, and they are worth a lot of money to the UK. But there are fewer bees than before. So, the Welsh government made a plan to help bees and other pollinators. They want to change some things, like planting more flowers that bees like near roads and train tracks. They talked to different groups who care about bees and the environment. They think they need to fix a few problems, like having more places for bees to live, and using fewer bad chemicals that hurt the bees. This plan will help bees and other pollinators in Wales and maybe in other places too."},{"prompt":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh treated the poor message runner like a prince when he arrived at the palace, if he brought good news.

A combination of talent, grit, and determination quickly transformed this young workhorse into a crucial element of the Cowboys' offense, revitalizing their playoff dreams and injecting life into a season that seemed all but lost. Early Struggles and Jones' Arrival Beginning their season with high expectations and a roster filled with both new and seasoned talent, the Dallas Cowboys immediately stumbled out of the gates, plagued by inconsistent performances and numerous injuries. As the losses mounted, the once-proud franchise appeared destined for yet another testing season and a missed opportunity for playoff contention. Enter Julius Jones - a talented rookie running back with the potential to shake things up. Drafted in the second round, Jones boasted impressive stats at Notre Dame, setting numerous records and garnering nationwide attention for his powerful running style. Initially sidelined due to a fractured scapula, Jones made his debut later in the season, immediately making an indelible impact on the team's offensive scheme. The Turning Point: Julius Jones in Action Though there was skepticism surrounding just how quickly Jones could acclimate to the NFL and the Cowboys' offense, the young running back proved to be a revelation. Displaying an uncanny aptitude for reading defenses and finding holes to exploit, Jones' combination of speed, agility, and power instantly changed the dynamic of the game for the Cowboys. As Jones began to rack up yards and touchdowns, the team rallied around their newfound asset, taking a little pressure off quarterback Tony Romo and giving the Dallas receiving corps more space to maneuver. Moreover, Jones' emergence helped to balance the team's overall offensive strategy, forcing defenses to respect the Cowboys' running game. Another significant factor contributing to Jones' success stemmed from the hard work and chemistry he cultivated with the Cowboys' offensive line. Trusting in the blockers and showing patience and vision on the field allowed Jones to seize every opportunity provided to him, further solidifying his importance when it came to the offensive game plan. Defying the Odds: The Playoff Push As the season progressed, Julius Jones continued to exceed expectations, becoming a vital component of the Cowboys' push for a playoff berth. As the team charted an increasingly impressive course through the NFL schedule, fans and analysts alike began to take notice of the unyielding spirit displayed by this once-counted-out franchise. Jones' relentless pursuit of achievement paralleled the very ethos of the Dallas Cowboys organization – persistence in the face of adversity. Conclusion In a season that appeared destined for disappointment, the Dallas Cowboys found a glimmer of hope in the outstanding performance of rookie running back Julius Jones. With his arrival on the field, the tides of fortune turned, demonstrating the immense impact a single player can have on a team's trajectory. As Julius Jones cemented his spot as one of the NFL's brightest young stars, he rekindled the Dallas Cowboys' playoff hopes and showcased a future overflowing with promise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day.

I went to Las Vegas last week, and I figured what better way to fill in the after dinner 9PM - 11PM time slot than with a show. I've already seen pretty much all the big named production shows in Vegas, some shows even multiple times even (Cirque Du Soleil's O, Ka, Mystere, Jubilee, Le Reve, Penn & Teller etc). I haven't seen Mystere since the late 90's, so I figured I'd see it again, reminiscing old times. If I remembered correctly, Mystere had a lot going on everywhere, so in order to get the best view, sitting a little farther back from the stage was better. I bought 2 tickets in section 202 center for about 80 a ticket. Not bad for the seats, and price as the view was excellent, especially since it was right in the center! Mystere was made back in 1993 by producer Franco Dragone, with music composed by Benoit Jutras. The same two also teamed up to make \\"O\\" at the Bellagio, and also teamed up to make \\"Le Reve\\" (non-Cirque du Soleil) at the Wynn. Having seen \\"O\\" recently, and \\"Mystere\\" almost 10 years ago, I could see Franco Dragone's creative touches and influences in Mystere that shows up in a larger scale in \\"O\\". Mystere is like Franco Dragone's baby, and \\"O\\" is like the upgraded version of Mystere with water. Franco Dragone must love large stage lifts, as they are seen in Mystere, and also in \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve\\" but with the additional water component. (Side Note: Franco Dragone and Benoit Jutras recently made \\"House of Dancing Waters\\" in Macao, which from the previews seems like a combination of the best components of \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve\\". These two are amazing!). I have to mention, the composer Benoit Jutras is a genius. There is nothing like a Cirque du Soleil show with music that we have no clue what they are saying. The music really adds to the shows. As mentioned above, Benoit Jutras made the music for \\"Mystere\\", \\"O\\", and \\"Le Reve\\", in which I love the music for all 3 shows. I'd say if you've already seen \\"O\\" or \\"Le Reve\\" or Ka, you might have to think twice about seeing Mystere. If you really like the circus/acrobatics aspect without the flashy stages, Mystere I'd say has the best acrobatics/circus aspect than O, Ka, or even Le Reve. All the performers in Mystere make it look so easy. If your more into the large stages, then Mystere might be a disappointment. Although considering Mystere was made in 1993, the stage still seems amazing even for todays standards for me. I definitely had a good time, and I was entertained for the full 90 minutes. Maybe its because I saw the 9:30PM show, but I was disappointed to see that a lot of seats were empty, especially on the sides.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts. Now, I have a new situation: Planet X had two large oceans. Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Answer this question please: Which ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Ice Ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. This is because the Ice Ocean had fewer submarine volcanoes compared to the Tropical Ocean, which had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

(a). in horny toads (b). in rats (c). in humans (d). in bears","completion":"(c). in humans Reptiles, like the horny toad, are cold-blooded animals, which means that they rely on the environment to regulate their body temperature. On the other hand, mammals such as rats, humans, and bears are warm-blooded animals, which means they have the ability to maintain a constant internal body temperature regardless of the external conditions. Out of the given options, humans (option c) have warmer blood compared to horny toads (option a), rats (option b), and bears (option d). First, let's understand why reptiles are cold-blooded. Reptiles have an ectothermic metabolism, which means they do not generate their own internal heat. They rely on external heat sources such as sunlight or the warmth of the environment to regulate their body temperature. This helps them conserve energy but limits their mobility and metabolic activities in extreme temperatures. For example, reptiles may become sluggish in colder temperatures, whereas they may be more prone to overheating in very hot environments. On the other hand, mammals are endothermic, which allows them to generate and maintain their body heat internally. This internal homeostasis enables them to function efficiently in a broader range of temperatures and environments. Humans, specifically, have several ways of maintaining their internal temperature, including the following: 1. Sweating: As a human's body temperature rises above the average level of approximately 98.6°F (37°C), sweat glands secrete sweat, which is mostly composed of water, onto the skin. When the sweat evaporates, it cools down the body and helps regulate internal temperature. 2. Shivering: When the body temperature drops below the normal range, the body begins to shiver to generate heat through muscle contractions. 3. Vasodilation and vasoconstriction: These mechanisms involve the widening or narrowing of blood vessels to regulate blood flow and heat distribution throughout the body. Vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) helps release heat when the body temperature increases, while vasoconstriction (constriction of blood vessels) conserves heat during cold conditions. 4. Metabolism: The human body continuously generates heat as a byproduct of various chemical reactions and metabolic processes, allowing for the maintenance of consistent internal temperature. In conclusion, while reptiles like horny toads rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature, mammals such as rats, humans, and bears generate and maintain their body heat through various specialized mechanisms. Among the given options, humans possess warmer blood, as they have several highly efficient ways to maintain a stable internal temperature, allowing them to thrive in diverse environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Menominee (also spelled Menomini, derived from the Ojibwe language word for \\"Wild Rice People;\\" known as Mamaceqtaw, \\"the people,\\" in the Menominee language) are a federally recognized nation of Native Americans, with a 353.894 sq mi (916.581 km2) reservation in Wisconsin. Their historic territory originally included an estimated 10 million acres (40,000 km2) in present-day Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The tribe currently has about 8,700 members. The tribe was terminated in the 1950s under federal policy of the time which stressed assimilation. The Menominee Indian Reservation is located in northeastern Wisconsin. For the most part, it is conterminous with Menominee County and the town of Menominee, which were established after termination of the tribe in 1961 under contemporary federal policy whose goal was assimilation. The tribe regained its federally recognized status and reservation in 1975. The reservation was created in a treaty with the United States signed on May 12, 1854 in which the Menominee relinquished all claims to the lands held by them under previous treaties, and were assigned 432 square miles (1,120 km2) on the Wolf River in present-day Wisconsin. An additional treaty, which they signed on February 11, 1856, carved out the southwestern corner of this area to create a separate reservation for the Stockbridge and Lenape (Munsee) tribes, who had reached the area as refugees from New York state. The latter two tribes have the federally recognized joint Stockbridge-Munsee Community. After the tribe had regained federal recognition in 1973, it essentially restored the reservation to its historic boundaries in 1975. Many small pockets of territory within the county (and its geographically equivalent town) are not considered as part of the reservation. These amount to 1.14% of the county's area, so the reservation is essentially 98.86% of the county's area. The largest of these pockets is in the western part of the community of Keshena, Wisconsin. The reservation includes a plot of off-reservation trust land of 10.22 acres (41,400 m2) in Winnebago County, Wisconsin to the south, west of the city of Oshkosh. The reservation's total land area is 353.894 sq mi (916.581 km2), while Menominee County's land area is 357.960 sq mi (927.11 km2). The small non-reservation parts of the county are more densely populated than the reservation, holding 1,337 (29.3%) of the county's 4,562 total population, as opposed to the reservation's 3,225 (70.7%) population, as of the 2000 census. The most populous communities are Legend Lake and Keshena. Since the late 20th century, the members of the reservation have operated a number of gambling facilities in these communities as a source of revenue. They speak English as well as their traditional Menominee language, one of the Algonquian languages.

A 7-month-old unvaccinated domestic shorthair cat was presented with a history of inappetence and hypersalivation. Clinical examination revealed fever, gingivitis and oral ulceration. An initial blood sample revealed a severe leukopenia and neutropenia and a feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) titre of 1:640; a second titre 10 days later was 1:2,560. A feline calicivirus (FCV) titre was 1:320 and the initial clinical signs and laboratory findings were attributed to a coinfection with FPV and FCV. The cat was treated with interferon omega. A blood sample taken 10 days later revealed a severe thrombocytosis of 3,448×10 9 /L (reference range 200-500×10 9 /L) confirmed by blood smear examination. The platelet count on day 35 was 4,990×10 9 /L. No bone marrow examination was carried out. Two differential diagnoses for an extreme thrombocytosis are a reactive thrombocytosis or essential thrombocythemia (ET). ET is a hemic neoplasia that causes a severe and persistent thrombocytosis, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Reactive thrombocytosis is generally mild to moderate and of shorter duration than described here, but an excessive response could have been caused by infection. The influence of additional factors such as an initial thrombocytopenia, age and interferon treatment are not clear but can be speculated on. Although the exact pathophysiology in this case remains unclear, such high, persistent thrombocyte numbers have not been reported in cats in the absence of a neoplastic process. A 7-month-old, male neutered domestic shorthair cat presented to his veterinarian with a complaint of inappetence and a swaying gait. The cat was allowed to go outside and was unvaccinated. The cat shared a household with a female littermate that had received only the first part of the primary vaccination 3 months previously. Upon examination, the cat was found to be pyrexic (temperature 41°C), and an examination of the oral cavity revealed an ulcerative gingivostomatitis. The gait abnormality was identified by the veterinarian as a hindlimb ataxia. A blood sample was collected and sent to the InVitro Diagnostic Laboratory.

Write a summary based on this article: ANDERSON, Calif. - The Anderson Police Department will start using nunchucks as a way to forcibly restrain suspects. Though nunchucks are not new to law enforcement, they are making a come back in Shasta County. They originated in Japan and have been used in martial arts for years. APD said they want to start using them because they are a multipurpose weapon. Nunchucks are illegal for citizens to own in California; however, police can be certified to use them within the state. The ones used by officers are made of plastic and are connected with a nylon rope. Sgt. Casey Day was recently certified to use nunchucks for the Anderson Police Department. He explained the different ways they can be used to help law enforcement. He said they can be used to hit, strike, jab and take someone down. They can also be used as a restraint to lock someone's hand, elbow or ankle. \\"These were kind of designed with a different goal in mind to be more of a control weapon, but like I said, it's not like we can't use these as an impact weapon,\\" Day explained. \\"They work really good as an impact weapon, but we try to emphasis a control tool over impact.\\" Day stated he's replacing his baton with the nunchucks because they work well and are more universal. He explained that if they are used with force, officers will focus on aiming at the criminal's hands, knees or wrists. They can also be used to block a punch or hit. Day added that he hasn't had to use them yet. Currently, the department is working to train all their officers to use nunchucks. ||||| Looking for another nonlethal way to take down suspects, the Anderson Police Department decided to go the way of the dragon. The police force in the Northern California town of about 10,000 people plans to equip its 20 officers with nunchakus, also known as nunchucks. Basically, they’re what martial arts legend Bruce Lee used – besides his fists of fury and feet -- to take down all those bad guys in his movies. The police department was looking for a versatile tool that would limit injuries to officers and the people they detained – but that would still be an effective means of subduing an unruly suspect. Anderson’s top brass decided nunchakus were the way to go, said Sgt. Casey Day. “It gives us the ability to control a suspect instead of striking them,” he said. Of course, if you’ve watched enough Lee movies you’ll notice that he didn’t use nunchakus to pacify his enemies. He beat them up with them. But Anderson police insist they can detain someone with them in a relatively peaceful way. Graphic: comparing batons and nunchucks On the website of the nunchakus’ manufacturer, Orcutt Police Defensive Systems Inc., the restraint technique is demonstrated. It shows a male officer using the nunchakus to grip the ankle of a man who is kicking his foot toward the officer’s face. The photo also depicts a female officer using them to hold a man’s wrist. The weapon, or tool, is often made of two wooden sticks or bars tethered together by a metal chain. (Developed by retired Colorado police Sgt. Kevin Orcutt in the 1980s, the Anderson Police Department's nunchakus are made of a hard plastic connected by a nylon cord designed to wrap around wrists and ankles). Wielded by martial arts experts, nunchakus can be used in complicated motions to fight off attackers. In the movies, including some of Lee’s, the occasional bad guy who gets the bright idea of trying to use it himself usually whacks himself in the face. Day was recently certified to train the department’s officers on the proper use of the nunchakus. He wants officers to have another option besides the baton, a traditional impact weapon. Officers won’t be required to use nunchakus, he said. But if officers decide to use them, they must pass a 16-hour training program. Day, a 15-year police veteran, said he has given up his baton for nunchakus. “I see the value and the safety they bring to me,” he said, adding that nunchakus provide a distance between an officer and a suspect. Sure, he was skeptical at first, Day said. But once he used the nunchakus, he was sold. The pincher-style nunchakus became popular in the police community in the 1980s, said Greg Meyer, a use-of-force expert and former Los Angeles Police Department training captain. Anaheim, San Diego and the LAPD are just some of the agencies that have used them– at least for a while. Some law enforcement agencies stopped using nunchakus when officers improperly used them -- in some cases resulting in broken wrists, he said. In 1991, the LAPD agreed to stop using nunchakus at protests– a decision sparked by a federal lawsuit filed by anti-abortion activists. The department opted to settle the lawsuit following the March 3 beating of Rodney G. King, which happened that same year. At the time, Deputy City Atty. Jack Brown, who was representing the LAPD, said the department was concerned about the public perception over using nunchakus to subdue people. Day hasn’t used his nunchakus, but is confident he will use them properly. “I don’t go around looking for trouble,” he said. Neither did Bruce Lee.

The iPod line came from Apple's \\"digital hub\\" category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \\"big and clunky or small and useless\\" with user interfaces that were \\"unbelievably awful,\\" so Apple decided to develop its own.

Read this article and answer this question The Bears opened the 2016 season on the road against the Houston Texans, who defeated the Bears in all three of their previous meetings, most recently a 13-6 win in 2012. The game was the second Bears-Texans game at NRG Stadium, the first being a Houston 31-24 win in 2008. On offense, the Bears faced a Texans defense that was ranked third in the NFL in 2015, which WBBM-TV writer Jeff Joniak wrote should be handled by controlling the ball and blocking defenders J. J. Watt, Whitney Mercilus and Jadeveon Clowney. Meanwhile, the Texans were led by quarterback Brock Osweiler, who guided the Broncos to victory against the Bears in his debut as an NFL starter last year. Osweiler was bolstered by a fast-paced receiving corps featuring DeAndre Hopkins and rookies Will Fuller and Braxton Miller. With an unproven roster, including six new starters on offense, Joniak believed the Bears should utilize this as an \\"element of surprise\\" against the Texans. On their opening drive, the Texans reached the Bears' 34-yard line, but had their drive end when Tracy Porter pulled the ball away from Hopkins for the interception; Chicago capitalized on the takeaway with Jeremy Langford's one-yard touchdown run. After the Texans punted, the Bears elected to attempt a fourth down conversion at Houston's 31-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs when Jay Cutler fumbled the snap. Nick Novak kicked a 28-yard field goal in the second quarter. The Texans took the lead when Osweiler threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins, and had a chance to increase the margin when Osweiler threw a potential 83-yard touchdown pass to Fuller, but he dropped the pass; they punted three plays later. With 31 seconds left in the half, the Bears offense traveled 75 yards on three plays, including a 54-yard pass by Cutler to Alshon Jeffery, ending the drive with Cutler's 19-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. On the second play of the third quarter, Cutler was intercepted by Andre Hal after Kevin White appeared to stop running his route midplay. Novak kicked a 28-yard field goal on the resulting drive. The next five drives of the game ended in punts, ending early in the fourth quarter when Fuller converted a screen pass into an 18-yard touchdown. The Texans increased the score to 23-14 via Novak's 38-yard kick. The Bears were unable to enter Houston territory on their final two drives. In comparison to the first half, the Bears offense struggled in the second; despite recording five first downs on their opening drive and a 75-yard series in the second quarter, the unit had just 71 yards and four first downs in the final two quarters. Cutler was sacked five times, including thrice after the Texans took the 20-14 lead.

Question: Which language spoken by 55 million people is not known to be related to any other Answer:","completion":"The language spoken by approximately 55 million people that is not conclusively known to be related to any other is Korean. Korean is the official language of both South Korea and North Korea, and the linguistic classification of this language is debated among scholars and linguists. Korean is considered an isolated language, meaning that it does not have any definitive connections with other languages or language families. However, there are multiple hypotheses about its possible relations, which include Altaic, Dravidian, Austronesian, and Ural-Altaic families, but none of these proposals have gained wide acceptance within the linguistic community. Due to the lack of evidence and consensus, Korean is often classified as a language isolate. Adjacent to Korea are the countries of China, Japan, and Russia, which have influenced its history and culture. Throughout the centuries, Korean has adopted many loanwords and cultural elements from neighboring languages such as Chinese and Japanese. The Korean writing system, Hangul, consists of a combination of logographic (hanja) characters borrowed from the Chinese language, and indigenous alphabetic (hangul) elements. Hangul was developed during the 15th century under the reign of King Sejong the Great, marking a significant departure from the earlier Chinese-based writing system. Despite being classified as a language isolate, Korean has several dialects that have notable differences in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Some of the major dialects include the Seoul dialect, which serves as the basis for the standard Korean used in South Korea; the Pyongan dialect, which is the foundation for the standard Korean in North Korea; and other regional dialects such as Gyeongsang, Jeolla, and Gangwon, among others. Moreover, the grammar of the Korean language follows the subject-object-verb (SOV) word order and relies heavily on agglutination as a method to express grammatical relationships between words. This involves attaching affixes to the base form of words to create meaningful expressions. Historically, the Korean language has been significantly influenced by both Confucian and Buddhist traditions, which have shaped its development. However, since the division of the Korean Peninsula after World War II, the two Koreas evolved separate dialects, vocabularies, and orthographies due to political and social differences. In conclusion, the Korean language is spoken by approximately 55 million people and is regarded as an isolated language with no definitive connections to other languages or language families. While various hypotheses have been proposed about its possible relations, the lack of concrete evidence and consensus among linguists has led to its classification as a language isolate, making it a unique and noteworthy language with a rich history and distinct characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: who was the egyptian god of the nile??","completion":"The Egyptian god of the Nile was Hapi, also known as Hapy. He was an extremely important figure in ancient Egyptian religion and mythology due to the crucial role the Nile River played in sustaining the lives of the Egyptian people. The Nile was the main source of water for crops and livestock, and its annual flooding deposited fertile silt along its banks, allowing the region to flourish. Hapi was considered the deity responsible for the annual flooding and fertility of the land. Although he was not the god of the Nile itself as a river (that honor would go to a goddess named \\"Nun\\"), he was responsible for bringing life, prosperity, and abundance through the waters he brought forth during the inundation period. This was a critical period for the ancient Egyptians, as it replenished the water supply and enabled agriculture to thrive. Therefore, Hapi held immense importance in the pantheon of Egyptian gods and goddesses. Hapi was often depicted as a well-built man with a round body, which reflected this notion of abundance. He usually had the appearance of fertility and prosperity, with a potbelly, wide hips, and pendulous breasts, typical of those who had ample amounts of food available. Hapi was shown with the beard of a pharaoh and a flower headpiece composed of lily stems, papyrus plants, and lotus flowers which symbolized both the Upper and Lower Egypt. As a representation of the Nile's unification of Egypt, Hapi was sometimes depicted with two faces - one looking towards Upper Egypt (the south) and the other towards Lower Egypt (the north). This symbolism represents the joining of these two regions through the Nile, which establishes the unity of the entire country. There were frequently offerings made to Hapi, consisting of food and drink, in an attempt to please the god and ensure that he would continue to provide the life-giving waters with which they so heavily relied upon. Hapi was not a prominent god from a specific city or region; rather, he was worshiped throughout Egypt due to the significance of the Nile for the whole country. Temples and sanctuaries dedicated to Hapi were located along the length of the river, with special emphasis paid to locations near key points of the Nile flood. His cult was spread throughout the land, and great celebrations were held in his honor during the time of the annual flooding and the related festivals that followed. In conclusion, Hapi, the Egyptian god of the Nile inundation, played a crucial role in ancient Egyptian religion and mythology. He was responsible for the annual flooding of the Nile that transformed an otherwise arid region into a fertile environment, supporting the survival and prosperity of the Egyptian civilization. Hapi was revered by Egyptians due to his power over their lives, and they worshipped him throughout the country, offering tributes in the hope of securing his continued blessings on their land."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Mel Gibson's Alleged Altercation: A Disturbing Audio Clip Raises Questions and Triggers Investigation Introduction: An unsettling recording, rumored to be capturing a heated dispute between renowned actor Mel Gibson and his then-girlfriend, has surfaced on the internet, garnering widespread attention and sparking debates. The allegations have prompted law enforcement agencies to initiate an investigation into the potential involvement of the actor in a case of domestic violence. Body: The audio clip, released on Monday, is the second suggestive recording to be leaked in under a week, both purportedly capturing a verbal spat between the Hollywood star and his ex-partner. In the unsettling recordings, a male voice can be heard engaging in a vehement exchange with a female voice, inevitably raising questions concerning the authenticity of the participants. The site that released the audio claims that the male voice belongs to Mel Gibson, although there has been no official confirmation from the actor's representatives. As the incident gains momentum, law enforcement agencies have initiated an investigation into allegations of domestic violence against Gibson. This development adds another chapter to the already beleaguered career of the actor, who has previously been mired in controversies on and off the set. The leaked audio recordings have once again pushed the issue of domestic violence into the public fore and have opened up a fresh debate on how such occurrences can happen within the confines of a seemingly perfect relationship, even involving high-profile figures. Although the true identity of the voices in the audio clip remains unconfirmed, the impact of the scandal on Mel Gibson's reputation is already evident. The actor, who has starred in and directed various blockbuster films, may face severe consequences in his personal and professional life should the allegations be proven true. This investigation is also likely to induce a thorough review of his previous relationships and intimate interactions. Conclusion: The recordings allegedly featuring Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend have left many shocked and pondering about the prevalence of domestic violence. As the authorities continue their investigation, the focus must not solely be on this particular case but on the broader implications of physical and emotional violence within relationships. Domestic violence does not discriminate; it affects people across all walks of life, and in various forms. It is essential, especially when high-profile cases come to light, that they elevate the discourse surrounding the issue of domestic assault, its consequences, and the steps to be taken to combat it. In the case of Mel Gibson, regardless of the truth behind the audio clip, the incident highlights the need for public figures to be held accountable for their actions and reinforces the importance of creating a safe environment for victims and survivors to speak up and seek help. As the entertainment industry continues to grapple with issues of abuse and misconduct, it is imperative to prioritize the welfare and mental well-being of the individuals involved, as well as to ensure a just outcome that serves as an example for future cases.

This is because the given premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis with certainty. While the premise sets a scene, the hypothesis makes a prediction about the outcome without accounting for all the variables involved. The main premise involves the following elements: 1. Drew is being followed by a boy and a girl on rangy, nervous horses. 2. The horses seem to have a significant amount of speed based on their appearance. 3. The scene occurs in the context of a location called Tubacca alley. The hypothesis suggests that: Drew knew the pursuers (the boy and the girl) would catch up to him momentarily. Now, let's consider the options provided. (i) Yes - If it were possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true, it would mean that there are no other factors that could affect the outcome, and the information available is sufficient to make that conclusion. However, we do not have enough details about Drew's awareness, the distance between them, or any potential obstacles in their path. Therefore, we cannot definitively say \\"yes\\" to this option. (ii) It is not possible to tell - This option is the most accurate answer.

Many factors might influence the outcome (e.g., horses' stamina, the actual distance between Drew and the pursuers, potential obstacles, etc.), making it impossible to tell for sure if the hypothesis is true given the premise. (iii) No - While we cannot conclusively say that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true, we also cannot definitively say this option is the most accurate. The hypothesis may still be true, but we lack enough information to confirm or deny it.

The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka.

However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts.

Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated.

Answer the following question: Information: - Sofia (or or ;) (\\"Sofiya\\",) is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. The city has a population of 1.26 million, while 1.68 million people live in its metropolitan area. The city is located at the foot of Vitosha Mountain in the western part of the country, within less than drive from the Serbian border. Its location in the centre of the Balkan peninsula means that it is the midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, whereas the Aegean Sea is the closest to it. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Vitosha, the ancient \\"Scomius\\" or \\"Scombrus\\", is a mountain massif, on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Vitosha is one of the symbols of Sofia and the closest site for hiking, alpinism and skiing. Convenient bus lines and rope ways render the mountain easily accessible. Vitosha has the outlines of an enormous dome. The territory of the mountain includes Vitosha nature park that encompasses the best known and most frequently visited parts. The foothills of Vitosha shelter resort quarters of Sofia; Knyazhevo quarter has mineral springs. Vitosha is the oldest nature park in the Balkans. The mountain emerged as a result of volcanic activity and has been subsequently shaped by the slow folding of the granite rock layers and a series of gradual uplifts of the area. It appears dome shaped at first sight, but the mountain, 19 km long by 17 km wide, actually consists of concentric denudational plateaus rising in tiers one above the other. Vitosha is separated into four main parts whose main ridges gather at a crown known as \\"Cherni Vrah\\" (\\"\\"Black Peak\\"\\"). This is the highest point of the mountain at 2290 m and is one of 10 peaks of Vitosha over 2000 m in height. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe.

He takes up an audience with the boy, and begins to explain the tale regarding the Lorax.The land once thrived with truffula trees when the Once-ler first came to the area in a horse-drawn cart. Living among the foliage are the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who eat truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond live the Humming Fish, and overhead fly the Swomee Swans. The trees amaze the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon builds a small shop in the area. After cutting down a truffula tree, the Lorax pops out of it's stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demands to know what the Once-ler is doing. The Once-ler explains that he is using the truffula tree's tufts to make something called a Thneed...a fine thing that all people need.The multi-purpose item soon attracts the attention of many customers, and the Once-ler continues to cut down more truffula trees. When it seems that the business is growing too big for just one Once-ler, he calls his relatives to help him with his thriving business.The business keeps growing and growing, until finally the Lorax demands an audience with the Once-ler, explaining that with the number of trees having been cleared, the Bar-ba-Loots have run out of truffula fruits, and have left to find new sources of food.The Once-ler ignores this, but is then met by the Lorax again, who explains that the smog from the factories has overwhelmed the Swomee Swans. Unable to sing because of the smog, the Lorax sends them off. The Once-ler claims he will 'think about it,' but this answer does not sit well with the Lorax.

Answer the following question: Given the background: For most substances, when the temperature of the solid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a liquid, and when the temperature of the liquid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a gas. We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point . and the situation: As a science experiment for his school homework, Kendra is putting two ice cubes on separate pans and then putting those pans on burners set to different temperatures. Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes. Answer the following question: Which ice cube will melt faster? Answer:","completion":"Ice cube B will melt faster than ice cube A. The reason for this is rooted in the way substances change their state from solid to liquid, which is dependent on the amount of heat energy provided to the substance. In this case, both ice cubes (A and B) are subjected to heat from burners set at different temperatures. As the temperature of a solid substance, such as ice, increases, the kinetic energy of its particles increases as well. This kinetic energy enables the particles to move more rapidly, which gradually weakens the attractive forces that hold them together in a solid state. When enough heat is absorbed, the kinetic energy of the particles overcomes the attractive forces, causing the solid to change into a liquid form. This is known as the process of melting. The melting point of a substance is the lowest temperature at which its particles can exist in a liquid state. In the case of ice, the melting point is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Since both ice cubes are initially in their solid state, they need to absorb a sufficient amount of thermal energy to achieve their melting point and transition into a liquid state, which is water in this case. The burners that Kendra uses have different temperature settings, with the one for ice cube A being set to a lower temperature and the one for ice cube B set to a higher temperature. With ice cube B being exposed to a higher temperature, it will absorb heat at a faster rate than ice cube A. This increased rate of heat absorption means that ice cube B's particles will gain more kinetic energy more quickly, allowing them to overcome the attractive forces and transition into a liquid state faster than the particles of ice cube A. Consequently, Kendra will observe that ice cube B melts at a faster pace than ice cube A, due to the different temperature settings on the burners and the impact of heat energy on the state transition of the ice cubes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Alphanumeric LEDs are available in seven-segment, starburst and dot-matrix format. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? pick from the following. (A). yes. (B). no.","completion":"(A) No. The provided answer was not detailed and long enough. Here is a detailed and long answer: Seven-segment LED displays are widely used in various electronic devices for displaying numeric or, in some cases, alphanumeric characters. These displays are composed of seven linear segments arranged in a specific pattern to represent numbers and some characters. There are several types of LEDs used in seven-segment displays, which are mainly distinguished by the materials used in their production, their color, and the technology used. Here is a list of various types of LEDs available in seven-segment format: 1. Inorganic LEDs: The most common type of LEDs used in seven-segment displays are inorganic LEDs, primarily made from materials like gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium phosphide (GaP), and gallium nitride (GaN). These LEDs are known for their high efficiency, brightness, and long life. a. Red LEDs: Red LEDs are made from aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP) or gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP). They are widely used due to their low cost and high efficiency. b. Green LEDs: Green LEDs in seven-segment displays typically use gallium phosphide (GaP) or aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP) materials. c. Blue LEDs: Blue LEDs are made from indium gallium nitride (InGaN) and are known for their high brightness and efficiency. 2. Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs): OLEDs are a relatively newer technology compared to inorganic LEDs. They consist of organic molecules that emit light when an electric current is applied. OLEDs offer the advantage of being flexible, thin, and lightweight, resulting in potential applications for flexible seven-segment displays and wearable technologies. 3. SMD (Surface-Mounted Device) LEDs: SMD LEDs are a type of LED package that can be mounted directly onto the surface of a PCB (Printed Circuit Board), without the need for through-hole soldering. SMD LEDs can be used for seven-segment displays that require a compact design or for densely packaged electronic devices. 4. Common Anode and Common Cathode: In addition to the material and color types, seven-segment LED displays can be classified into common anode and common cathode configurations. In a common anode display, all the anode connections of the LEDs are tied together, and segments are turned on or off by grounding individual segment cathodes. In contrast, in a common cathode design, all the cathode connections of the LEDs are tied together, and segments are turned on or off by applying a voltage to individual segment anodes. 5. Multicolor and RGB LEDs: Some seven-segment displays utilize multi-color LEDs or RGB LEDs, which can display multiple colors by combining individual Red, Green, and Blue LEDs. This allows for more vibrant and dynamic color displays in various applications. In conclusion, various types of LEDs are available for use in seven-segment displays, with options regarding the materials, colors, and technologies used. These options provide flexibility for designers and engineers working on various applications, from simple numeric displays to more advanced, multi-color, and flexible displays."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Summarize the following: Different people react to miscarriage in different ways, but everyone — regardless of the circumstances of the miscarriage — needs time to heal. It is important to grieve the loss of your baby as much as you need, as this helps you to accept the loss and begin the healing process. If you are feeling constantly down and can't seem to recover from your miscarriage, it might be a good idea to seek the help of a counselor. They can help you to work through your feelings and allow you to make sense of what you're going through. It is important to find a counselor that you feel comfortable around, so you feel comfortable opening up about your sadness, fear and anxiety. The hormonal changes that take place in the mother's body following a miscarriage can heighten feelings of sadness or anger, which your partner may not be able to fully understand. Therefore, finding a friend, a close relative or even a support group to whom you can express your feelings is very important. This helps to promote healing and prevent depression. However, it's important to be be conscious of the fact that a miscarriage is a distressing experience for both the mother and the partner. Both experience the emotional strain of losing the baby, so don't shut your partner out — it is essential that you support each other throughout the grieving process. Also try to keep in mind that both partners may grieve differently. For example, you may cry out loud, while your partner keeps their grief to themselves. This does not mean that their pain is any less real, so try to be understanding. Once you get over the initial physical symptoms of a miscarriage, it's recommended that you work out as much as possible. Any form of exercise is good, as it reduces the levels of androgens (stress hormones) in our body and releases endorphins (happy, relaxing hormones) instead. Start out by going for a daily 20 minute walk to get the blood flowing — the fresh air will do you good. After that, you can move on to more strenuous activities, like running, biking or rowing. Find a type of exercise that you enjoy doing — anything from dancing to rock climbing to horseback riding. The months following a miscarriage are a difficult time, so it's important to indulge in activities that bring you happiness Doing yoga everyday is highly recommended for women recovering from a miscarriage, as it provides a form of light exercise and helps to calm the mind and relieve tension. Yoga involves a series of breathing exercises, which promote feelings of calmness and relaxation while also delivering more oxygen into the blood stream, relaxing the muscles and helping you to feel better physically. Yoga can be practiced in the comfort of your own home, with the help of a yoga mat and DVD, or you can find out about classes in your local area. For more detailed instruction on how to do specific yoga breathing exercises, see this article. Anti-anxiety and antidepressant drugs are available to help with depression and anxiety if these feelings become overwhelming. These medications work by inhibiting the serotonin receptors that cause more depression and grief. These medicines can take up to 3 weeks before you feel a noticeable difference, but over time they tend to produce good results. Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription. The time it take to returning to work and resume normal, everyday activities following a miscarriage varies from one person to another. Some people will return to work early as a way of dealing with the emotional trauma associated with the loss of their baby. Other people take more time because they don't feel ready to face the real world just yet. How much time you take off after a miscarriage is a completely personal choice, which should be informed by how you feel both mentally and physically. Take as much time as you need — there's no need to rush the decision. Following a miscarriage, it is recommended that you plan any future pregnancies with the help of an obstetrician. The obstetrician will advise you on any precautions you can take to avoid future miscarriages — this may include instructions to rest enough during pregnancy and follow a balanced diet. He or she may also prescribe you drugs to minimize the chances of miscarrying. This can help you to feel more relaxed and secure during your next pregnancy. For more detailed information on how to prevent a miscarriage, see this article.","completion":"Miscarriages affect people differently and require time to heal.

EXCLUSIVE-India likely to bring in rules to make mills export sugar stocks-sources * Indian PM Modi discussed the issue at the weekend * Policy could be introduced from Oct 1 -sources * Surge in sugar exports could come amid glut in world market * India also considering small local tax on sugar -sources NEW DELHI, Aug 5 (Reuters) - India is likely to bring in rules to make it compulsory for sugar mills to export millions of tonnes of surplus supplies to support local prices, sources said, in a move that could quell growing anger among farmers but add to a glut on global markets. A final decision rests with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who discussed the politically sensitive issue at a weekend meeting with ministers, officials and sugar mill bosses, said the two government sources. The proposal, which could mean mills selling at loss, comes at time when the world sugar market is grappling with a flood of supplies and prices at 6-1/2-year lows. The mandatory export rule, which could be introduced from the start of the next crop year on Oct. 1, would apply only when output was higher than local demand, said the officials, who are directly involved in formulating the policy. If approved, India could overtake Australia as the world's third-largest exporter behind Brazil and Thailand. Food ministry spokesman N.C. Joshi declined to comment. Apart from boosting farm exports, government-backed overseas sales of sugar could also help mills clear about 2.5 billion they owe to 50 million cane growers - a group equivalent in size to the population of Spain and concentrated in politically important states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Last year, Modi won 9 out of 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh, which sends the highest number of lawmakers to parliament, as rural voters were swayed by a pledge to keep crop prices high. But mills have been struggling to pay the fixed price to cane farmers, who have been losing patience as the amount of money they are owed piles up. India, the world's largest sugar consumer and biggest producer after Brazil, has been producing more sugar than it needs for the past five years and the trend is likely to continue. At last Saturday's meeting, there was also discussion on an additional tax, which the government calls a cess, on sugar to prop up domestic prices that are the lowest in six years, said the officials. \\"Mandatory exports may force mills to sell sugar at a loss now, but they would (eventually) gain because lower domestic stocks mean higher domestic prices, which will get a leg up because of the cess,\\" said one of the sources. India's mills are expected to produce 28 million tonnes in the next season, when inventories will climb to 10.3 million tonnes, up from 7.5 million tonnes at the start of the current season. Indians consume 24-25 million tonnes of sugar a year, thus could easily export 5-6 million tonnes yearly even after stocking up for emergencies, analysts said. That would be more than the 3 million tonnes that Australia sells and compares to Brazil's exports of 27 million tonnes and Thailand's 10 million tonnes. The sources said the government may also step in to help mills pay dues by using funds raised from the tax. The federal government fixes the price that mills pay to cane growers yearly and some states, invariably, raise it further. In the past six years, government-set prices have soared by 70 percent but sugar prices have slumped to 2,200 rupees (34) a tonne, against an average cost of production of 3,100 rupees. Experts say the higher cane price is the main reason for the surplus which has helped avoid sharp output swings, such as when India had to import 4.3 million tonnes in 2008/09 after exporting 5 million tonnes a year earlier, pushing benchmark New York prices to a 30-year high. Despite an export incentive of 4,000 rupees a tonne, India's overseas sales are expected to be only 800,000 tonnes in the 2014/15 season against 2.2 million tonnes in the previous year. Abinash Verma, director general of the Indian Sugar Mills Association, said the push for exports could lead to further losses at mills but eventually mean a balance between demand and supply at home.

Das and Ed Davies) What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about India possibly making new rules for sugar mills to export millions of extra sugar supplies to help local prices. This move could help the problems Indian farmers are facing, but may also add to the large amount of sugar already in the global market.

If this happens, India might become the third largest exporter in the world after Brazil and Thailand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: An advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors which have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor can be used to agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature. Question: How is stepped speed control achieved?","completion":"Stepped speed control in universal motors is achieved by having multiple taps on the field coil.

Q:You are given a new situation: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment. and a hint : There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.

Evaluate the right side of the equation: -680 - 616 = -1296 Now the equation is: 48i = -1296 4. Solve for i by dividing both sides of the equation by 48: i = -1296 / 48 5. Simplify the expression on the right side: i = -27 The value of i that satisfies the equation is -27."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

While there, Bob Irisen â a storm chaser with the National Weather Service â is driving down a country road to track a freak supercell thunderstorm. As a tornado touches down yards away, right as their daughter arrives home from school, Bob warns a family about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their cellar just before it destroys their farm. Meanwhile, in (the fictional town of) Blainsworth, Nebraska (the book is set in the real-world city of Grand Island),[1][2] teenager Dan Hatch, an aspiring and practicing artist who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather Jack to be an athlete, participates in a bike race and damages his bicycle; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bicycle, Danny and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Danny is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Danny and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Danny to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to a fill-in shift as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work. On the road, while continuing to track the massive storm creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southeast into Blainsworth, as the meteorologist he is radioing to is astonished at the uncharacteristic spring-like nature of the storm system for the fall; while there, he meets Laura and Jenny while getting some coffee at the diner. The action begins after Jack comes home at mid-evening; as he sits down to watch television, the show he is watching is interrupted by a severe weather bulletin reporting about a tornado sighting near Dannebrog, 14 miles (23Â km) northwest of Blainsworth.

Question: Why were religious figures like Christ painted red? Context: Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.

Gandhi A:","completion":"Title: The Uprising Genre: Historical Drama Plot Summary: The Uprising is a riveting historical drama that chronicles the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as he is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from British rule. Set in early 20th century India, the movie focuses on the personal and political struggles Gandhi faces as he becomes the face of India's quest for freedom, all the while fighting against tradition, prejudice, and his own insecurities. Act 1: The movie starts with Gandhi, a young lawyer from Gujarat, traveling to South Africa to work as a legal advisor for a wealthy Indian businessman. Witnessing blatant racism and the struggles of Indians there, Gandhi embarks on a personal mission to fight against injustice, eventually forming the Natal Indian Congress. His efforts in South Africa draw the attention of Indian freedom fighters back home, who urge him to return and join their cause. Act 2: Upon his return to India, Gandhi begins to familiarize himself with the dire situation of the Indians under British rule. As he travels through the country and witnesses scenes of extreme poverty, he becomes convinced that India must fight for its independence from Britain. Gandhi implements the nonviolent civil disobedience method and joins the Indian National Congress, eventually becoming their leader. Act 3: Under Gandhi's leadership, the Indian National Congress organizes nonviolent protests, boycotts, and marches that gradually gain momentum and popular support. The Dandi March is one such turning point, where Gandhi and thousands of followers walk nearly 240 miles to the Arabian Sea and make their own salt as a symbolic act of defiance against the British salt tax. Act 4: Despite revolts breaking out within the Indian National Congress and growing violent incidents, Gandhi remains committed to the nonviolent approach and fasts as a form of protest. His consistent emphasis on nonviolence and unity across religious lines begins to catalyze nationwide support. Act 5: Gandhi's efforts ultimately lead to the Quit India Movement, wherein a mass civil disobedience campaign is launched against British rule. The movement culminates in the nationwide cry for independence, and after years of tireless struggle, India finally achieves freedom from Britain in 1947. Epilogue: Despite the triumph of India's independence, tragedy strikes as the Indian subcontinent is partitioned into the dominions of India and Pakistan, leading to widespread riots and bloodshed between Hindus and Muslims. In the wake of the partition, Gandhi fasts and prays for peace, but his vision of a united India is left unfulfilled. Nevertheless, his selfless dedication to the cause of freedom and the principles of nonviolence leaves a lasting impact across the world, immortalizing him in history as the \\"Mahatma\\" (or \\"Great Soul\\")."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Pessimistic Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) lives life based on statistics and fears everything. His exasperated parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and Mel Harris) have tried multiple ways to build up the courage of their son, but to little success. Richard is sent to buy a bag of nails for building a treehouse. However, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm and takes shelter in a library. He meets Mr. Dewey (Christopher Lloyd), an eccentric librarian who gives him a library card, despite Richard's protests he doesn't want a book, since he's only there to escape the storm. Searching for a phone, Richard finds a large rotunda painted with famous literary characters. He slips on some water dripping from his coat and falls down, knocking himself out. Richard awakens to find the rotunda art melting, which washes over him and the library, turning them into illustrations.He is met by the Pagemaster (Christopher Lloyd), who sends him through the fiction section to find the library's exit. Along the way, Richard befriends three anthropomorphic books: Adventure (Patrick Stewart), a swashbuckling gold pirate-like book; Fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg), a sassy but caring lavender fairy tale book; and Horror (Frank Welker), a fearful turquoise \\"Hunchbook\\" with a misshapen spine. The three agree to help Richard if he checks them out. Together, the quartet encounter classic-fictional characters. They meet Dr. Jekyll (Leonard Nimoy) who turns into Mr. Hyde, driving them to the open waters of the Land of Adventure. However, the group is separated after Moby-Dick attacks, following the whale's battle with Captain Ahab (George Hearn). Richard and Adventure are picked up by the Hispaniola, captained by Long John Silver (Jim Cummings). The pirates go to Treasure Island, but find no treasure, nearly causing a mutiny. Fantasy and Horror return and defeat the pirates. Silver attempts taking Richard with him, but surrenders when Richard threatens him with a sword. As Adventure insulted Horror, it caused the hunchbook to get captured by Lilliputians from Gulliver's Travels. Adventure saves him and they make up.In the fantasy section, Richard sees the exit sign on the top of a mountain. However, Adventure's bumbling awakens a dormant dragon. Richard tries to fight the dragon with a sword and shield, but the dragon wraps its tail around him and shakes his armor and weapons off, throws him into the air and swallows him. Richard finds books in the dragon's stomach and uses a beanstalk from the Jack and the Beanstalk to escape. He and the books use it to reach the exit. They enter a large dark room where the Pagemaster awaits them. Richard berates the Pagemaster for the horrors that he suffered, but the Pagemaster reveals the journey was intended to make Richard face his fears. Dr. Jekyll, Captain Ahab, Long John Silver and the dragon reappear in a magical twister congratulating him. The Pagemaster then swoops Richard and the books into the twister, sending them back to the real world.Richard awakens, finding Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror next to him as real books. Mr. Dewey finds him, and, even though the library policy only allows a person to check out two books at time, lets him check out all three books \\"just this once.\\" When Richard leaves, Mr. Dewey gives a smile, hinting that Richard's entire adventure was not a dream and that he is the Pagemaster; adding onto this possibility is that Richard was missing his jacket when he awoke.Richard returns home a braver kid, sleeping in his new treehouse.

Jason Roy smashed a stunning century to set England Lions on course to take a 2-0 lead in their one-day series against South Africa A, although they were given a fright by the home opener Reeza Hendricks. Roy, who had top-scored in the low-scoring opening match in Bloemfontein with 43, piled into the South Africa A bowlers on a Kimberley pitch which justified its reputation as a batsmen's paradise, hitting 13 fours and six sixes after the Lions had been put in. The Surrey opener made 141, his first Lions century and his highest score in 50-over cricket, from only 110 balls before he was dismissed in the 40th over, ending a second-wicket stand of 198 in 26 overs with his captain James Vince. Jason Roy top-scored for England Lions with 141 as they beat South Africa A by 141 runs on Wednesday. Roy's innings helped England on their way to posting 376 for nine as they claimed a 2-0 one-day series lead. Vince fell agonisingly short of his second century of the tour six overs later, adjudged lbw for 99 from 95 balls, and although wickets tumbled late in the innings, Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes maintained the momentum for an imposing total of 376 for nine. There seemed a real danger that would not be enough as Hendricks and Dean Elgar responded with an opening stand of 142 inside 18 overs under the Diamond Oval floodlights. It was Lancashire left-arm spinner Stephen Parry, making his first appearance of the tour, who dragged the Lions back into the match with a tidy spell which earned him the wickets of Elgar, for 66 from 59 balls, and Dane Vilas. Liam Plunkett then claimed one wicket and Mark Wood a couple, but it was Stokes who finally removed Hendricks, driving to cover in the 37th over after making 141, the same score as Roy, from four balls fewer with 14 fours and five sixes. Alex Less readies himself to hit the ball during the match in Kimberley on Wednesday. Harry Gurney also took two wickets before Plunkett returned to claim the last two and end with three for 73 as South Africa A were dismissed for 306 in the 45th over, but Parry remained comfortably the most economical bowler. The Lions now have the first of three chances to clinch the series in Potchefstroom on Saturday, when South Africa's World Cup wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock is expected to boost the home team as he looks for match practice after an ankle injury. Tim Bresnan could come into contention for the Lions, as the Yorkshire all-rounder flew into Johannesburg on Wednesday, and Sam Billings hopes to recover from the nasty illness which ruled him out in Kimberley.

OPT: (1). degradation of nutrients due to pesticides; (2). formation of deserts due to tree felling; (3). flooding due to dam construction; (4). removal of nutrients due to heavy rains; Your answer:","completion":"The option that best represents a soil change due to only natural causes is (4). removal of nutrients due to heavy rains. Since ancient times, soil erosion by water has been a natural geological process shaping landforms and contributing to soil formation. However, it is also one of the most significant global environmental problems. When heavy rain falls, the kinetic energy of the falling water detaches soil particles. This process is called splash erosion. The fallen water also contributes to the saturation of the soil, enhancing the runoff effect; this is known as sheet erosion. At a more localized level, smaller water currents form and begin to transport detached soil particles downstream, resulting in a process called rill erosion. If these currents become more significant, they can create larger and deeper channels called gullies which, in some cases, can reach several meters deep and wide. All these erosion processes remove and transport soil nutrients and organic matter, degrading the soil fertility and structure. The removed soil particles rich in nutrients are typically deposited in reservoirs, deltas, and the seabed, causing a loss of agricultural productivity in eroded areas, while potentially stimulating productivity in the deposition zones. The lost nutrients have to be replaced, most often artificially via the application of fertilizers, to maintain agricultural productivity, which subsequently increases the economic cost of farming. Therefore, the removal of nutrients due to heavy rains could be considered a soil change due solely to natural causes. This is different from the other options mentioned: degradation of nutrients due to pesticides, formation of deserts due to tree felling, and flooding due to dam construction, which all result from human activities. Pesticides are synthetic substances applied to control pests, weeds, and diseases; tree felling refers to the cutting down of trees, often due to deforestation activities; and dam construction is another human action that significantly transforms landscape and affects natural water flow, all of which have significant impacts on soil conditions and characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A high school valedictorian denied her diploma after delivering a speech deemed too racy by her principal says she will not apologize for her choice of words. Appearing on NBC's Today show, recent graduate Kaitlin Nootbaar from Oklahoma's Prague High School said she doesn't need her diploma nor does her school need her apology after using the word 'Hell' in her class speech. 'I know what I've achieved and the fact that I don't want to give an apology, maybe I'll never get my diploma and that's fine,' the 18-year-old told NBC's Matt Laurer on Wednesday. Scroll down for video. Won't back down: High school valedictorian Kaitlin Nootbaar has refused to apologize after delivering a speech at her high school graduation that included the word 'Hell' in it. Upset: Because of her refusal to apologize, her former high school has refused to give her her diploma which has upset both her and her father, left. Appearing by her father's side, David Nootbaar, a military veteran, expressed his pride in his daughter for not backing down and practicing her first amendment in her speech that drew laughter and applause by her fellow students. 'Why should she bow down to this man and give those rights away when so many young men are laying their lives on the line to protect those rights?' Mr Nootbaar said. Moving on without her diploma, Miss Nootbaar is preparing to start her freshmen year at Southwestern Oklahoma State University on a full scholarship this fall after receiving straight A's throughout her four years in high school. When she went to collect her certificate from the school's administration office last week she was told she wouldn't be getting it until she wrote a formal letter apologising for using the unacceptable word. Not needed: Despite denied her diploma, the straight-A student says she doesn't need it as she embarks on her freshmen year of college on full scholarship. Apology: The 18-year-old issued an apology to her school and teachers on Wednesday, however, after hearing of numerous calls of harassment over the issue. 'We went to the office and asked for the diploma and the principal said \\"Your diploma is right here but you’re not getting it. Close the door we have a problem\\",' Mr Nootbaar told kfor.com. The script for the teenager's speech - inspired by the film Eclipse: The Twilight Saga -. had been given to the school in advance of the ceremony. It included the. word 'heck' but in the moments leading up to the ceremony she said she decided to change it to 'hell' instead. 'Right before I got on stage is when I talked it over with my classmates and the ones I had talked to were like no go ahead and say it!' she told NBC. As her father explained: 'Her quote was, when she first started school she wanted to be a nurse, then a veterinarian. Parody: The valedictorian, pictured, said that her speech was a parody of one given in the Twilight movie Eclipse. 'And now that she was getting closer. to graduation people would ask her what do you want to do and she said. \\"How the hell do I know? I’ve changed my mind so many times.\\"' Furious, Miss Nootbaar said she won't be saying sorry because she doesn't think she did anything wrong. 'She earned that diploma she completed all the state curriculum,' said Mr Nootbaar. 'In four years she has never made a B. She got straight A’s and had a 4.0 the whole way through. 'She has worked so hard to stay at the top of her class and this is not right.' Despite her upset, Miss Nootbaar did offer one apology to her teachers, however. 'I'm sorry about the problems that this has caused the school especially the teachers. I've heard that they've been getting calls from numerous people and that would be nice if that would stop,' she said. Watch the video here:.

Does the sentence \\"However, the influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect, and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as in the past.\\" answer the question \\"Along with New Yorkese, what is another name for the New York dialect?\\"","completion":"No, the provided sentence does not answer the question \\"Along with New Yorkese, what is another name for the New York dialect?\\". Instead, the sentence explains how the influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has affected the distinctive New York dialect, causing a decline in the prevalence of its traditional form among the general population of New York. To answer the question \\"Along with New Yorkese, what is another name for the New York dialect?\\", we can look into the various names and variations of this dialect. The New York dialect, also known as New Yorkese or New York City English, has been influenced by the various waves of immigration and cultural shifts throughout the city's history, which in turn has spawned a range of sub-dialects and associated terms. These include terms such as Brooklynese, Bronxese, or Noo Yawk Tawk, which are often used to describe the speech patterns and accents specific to certain boroughs or neighborhoods of New York City. New York City English is best characterized by its unique pronunciations, vocabulary, and grammatical structures, which have set it apart from the standard American English. Some of the most distinctive features of this dialect include the pronunciation of the \\"r\\" sounds (also known as the \\"New York r\\"), the nasalized \\"a\\" sounds, and the use of specific slang words or expressions unique to the city. As mentioned earlier, several changes have occurred within the dialect over the years, due to the influx of both European and non-European immigrants, socio-economic shifts, and increased exposure to standard American English. This has led to a gradual decline in the prominence of the traditional New York dialect, especially among younger generations. However, it still remains an important part of the city's cultural history and a symbol of its diverse and dynamic linguistic heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process: - Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through the stomates by diffusion - Water is transported to the leaves in the xylem - Energy harvested through light reaction is stored by forming ATP - Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used to create sugar - Oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion - The plant reuses the water or the water exits through the stomata as water vapor. suppose area is cleared around the plant happens, how will it affect less oxygen exits through leaves. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"If an area is cleared around the plant, it will likely have an indirect impact on a step in the process. The reason for this is that the physical conditions and environment surrounding the plant can influence various aspects of plant growth and development. For example, if an area is cleared around the plant, factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed may change, which could indirectly influence stomatal opening and closing. Stomata are responsible for regulating gas exchange (carbon dioxide and oxygen) and water vapor transpiration. As a result, these environmental changes might influence the rate of transpiration and the diffusion of oxygen out of the leaves. However, this perturbation will not directly affect the core process of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide is converted into glucose and oxygen using the energy from light. The main steps of photosynthesis, such as light absorption, electron transfer, and carbon fixation, will still occur as long as the plant has access to light, water, and carbon dioxide. In summary, clearing an area around a plant may have indirect effects on the rate at which oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata, but it does not directly impact the fundamental photosynthetic processes occurring within the plant cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Make your wife feel good by giving her compliments or praise. Think of the compliments you gave her when you first started dating. Tell her those same compliments and how they still make you love her even more. Start the day by giving your wife a compliment. Let her know at the start of the day how beautiful she is and how lucky you are to have her. Be persistent. If she refuses your compliment or she undercuts your compliment because she doesn’t think you are sincere, be persistent. Tell her again and look into to her eyes, then give her a hug to let her know that you are serious. An indirect way to compliment your wife is to stop ogling other women. A harmless glance never hurt anybody, but if you stare or make a comment it will hurt your wife’s feelings. Keep your focus on your wife; she will appreciate it. Brag about her to other people. If she hears you she will adore you. Or somebody will eventually tell her what you said and she will appreciate it. This does not mean you need to go out and buy expensive jewelry, clothes, or a hand bag; rather, something thoughtful like a surprise back rub, a hot bath with rose petals, or a bouquet of flowers sent to her work. Buy her a cozy robe she can wrap herself up in after a hot bath or shower. Give her some time alone to relax and do what she wants to do around the house. Cook her favorite dinner. All she has to do is show up and sit at the table. You do the rest. Get her some plush slippers to wear around the house. Prepare a picnic all by yourself and pick a scenic location. Good smelling toiletries are always a hit. Give her some bath goodies and prepare a hot bath with rose petals. Then, have her cozy robe and plush slippers ready when she gets out. Chocolate, of course, almost always works. Women love to receive original love letters from the person they care most about and, in today’s world, a love letter is very rare indeed. Sending “I am thinking about you” texts, tweets, or emails are nice, but putting something down on paper and placing it in an envelope with her name on it is something special. She will certainly consider this a thoughtful gift. Write down your most romantic thoughts and memories on nice letter paper. Make it smell good by spraying a small amount of her favorite scent or your aftershave or cologne on the paper. Be romantic and write a letter for every week of the year. Don’t copy something you found on the internet. Make sure your letter is original and sincere by expressing your appreciation and clearly describing your feelings as you write down your thoughts. This will personalize your letter. Try poetry. Even if you never wrote a poem before, she will certainly appreciate your effort. This does not mean the typical, and perhaps boring, dinner and a movie. Instead, try something novel, inspirational, or adventurous that provides a lasting and romantic memory for life. Try something spontaneous and adventurous like arriving at the airport with no bags or destination and jump on a plane to somewhere you never been before. Do something inspirational, like participating in a new activity together. Try making pottery, go ice skating, or take a class on how to give a sensual massage. Seek out something novel, like a hot air balloon ride, horseback riding, or rock climbing. The nice thing about long marriages is that you create a lot of good memories. Don’t let those memories get stuck in a photo album or in reminiscing – relive them. Treat your wife like she is your girlfriend all over again. Take a trip back to where you first met. Kiss her and compliment her like you did when you were trying to win her over. Visit the restaurant where you had your first date or go to the movie theater where you watched your first movie together. Sit down and watch your wedding video again. Tell her how beautiful she was on that special day and how she is still beautiful to this day. People often get caught up on how many times a week they have sex or become so busy with their job, kids, and other responsibilities that sex becomes more of an act that an intimate encounter. Try to take one day a week to slow things down and become deeply intimate with your wife by spending quality time in the bedroom together. Show her that making love to her is still something that is important. There is no actual “right amount of sex” for a married couple to have. Focus on quality rather than quantity if you are trying to get your wife to love you again. Concentrate on all the special actions that demonstrate to your wife that you are “making love” rather than “having sex.” Although it’s nice to have candles lit after a hot bath with soft music playing in the background for a romantic encounter, quality does not necessarily mean romantic. Quality sex should be intimate and a show your desire to show your wife that you truly love her. Practice good health and hygiene. Your wife will be proud to be at your side if you take pride in your appearance. She will probably appreciate it if you stay in good shape. Take a shower every day, wear clean clothes, and brush your teeth and hair. This also means to clean up after yourself. Throw dirty clothes in the hamper and clean up the sink when you are finished shaving. Mind your manners. Living with somebody for a long time gives comfort and security that should not be taken advantage of. Use manners when you have a bodily function, such as saying, \\"Excuse me\\" when you burp or pass gas.","completion":"To make your wife feel good and loved, practice giving her compliments and praise consistently, reminding her of the qualities you loved about her from the beginning of your relationship. Start your day by complimenting her and be persistent even if she tries to shrug it off. Avoid ogling other women and instead, focus on your wife and brag about her to others. Show her your appreciation through thoughtful gestures such as surprising her with a prepared hot bath with rose petals, cooking her favorite dinner, or buying her a cozy robe and slippers. Small gifts like chocolates and heartfelt, handwritten love letters also go a long way in making her feel special. Keep the romance alive by engaging in creative and adventurous activities together. This can include spontaneous trips, learning new activities together, or rekindling old memories by revisiting places where you shared significant experiences together. Prioritize intimacy in your relationship, focusing on the quality of your time in the bedroom rather than the frequency of your encounters. Concentrate on creating a deeply connected and loving atmosphere when making love. Maintain good health, hygiene, and manners as a sign of respect and consideration for your wife. Keep yourself clean, pick up after yourself, and practice polite behavior, even in the comfort of your own home. By consistently doing these things, you can make your wife feel cherished and loved in your relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A woman searching Nero's pockets uncovers pistols, a number of pocket watches—evidence of his having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in Industry and Idleness), and a letter from Ann Gill which reads: Dear TommyMy mistress has been the best of women to me, and my conscience flies in my face as often as I think of wronging her; yet I am resolved to venture body and soul to do as you would have me, so do not fail to meet me as you said you would, for I will bring along with me all the things I can lay my hands on. So no more at present; but I remain yours till death. Ann Gill. The spelling is perfect and while this is perhaps unrealistic, Hogarth deliberately avoids any chance of the scene becoming comical. A discarded envelope is addressed \\"To Thos Nero at Pinne...\\". Ronald Paulson sees a parallel between the lamb beaten to death in the Second Stage and the defenceless girl murdered here. Below the print, the text claims that Nero, if not repentant, is at least stunned by his actions: Various features in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder takes place in a graveyard, said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone; an owl and a bat fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one for the end of the witching hour. The composition of the image may allude to Anthony van Dyck's The Arrest of Christ. A lone Good Samaritan appears...

Information: - The Holy Land (Hebrew: , ; Arabic: ) is an area roughly located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River. Traditionally, it is synonymous with both the biblical Land of Israel and historical Palestine. The term usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern State of Israel, the Palestinian territories, western Jordan, and parts of southern Lebanon and southwestern Syria. It is considered holy by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Yaghi-Siyan (died June 3, 1098) was the governor of Antioch during the First Crusade. - The Siege of Antioch took place during the First Crusade in 1097 and 1098 . The first siege , by the crusaders against the Muslim - held city , lasted from 21 October 1097 to 2 June 1098 . Antioch lay in a strategic location on the crusaders ' route to Palestine . Supplies , reinforcements and retreat could all be controlled by the city . Anticipating that it would be attacked , the Muslim governor of the city , Yaghi - Siyan , began stockpilling food and sending requests for help . The Byzantine walls surrounding the city presented a formidable obstacle to its capture , but the leaders of the crusade felt compelled to besiege Antioch anyway . The crusaders arrived outside the city on 21 October and began the siege . The garrison sortied unsuccessfully on 29 December . After stripping the surrounding area of food , the crusaders were forced to look farther afield for supplies , opening themselves to ambush and while searching for food on 31 December , a force of 20,000 crusaders encountered a relief force led by Duqaq of Damascus heading to Antioch and defeated the army . However , supplies dwindled and in early 1098 one in seven of the crusaders was dying from starvation and people began deserting in January . A second relief force , this time under the command of Ridwan of Aleppo , advanced towards Antioch , arriving on 9 February . Like the army of Duqaq before , it was defeated . Antioch was captured on 3 June , although the citadel remained in the hands of the Muslim defenders . Kerbogha began the second siege , against the crusaders who had occupied Antioch , which lasted from 7 June to 28 June 1098 . The second siege ended when the crusaders exited the city to engage Kerbogha 's army in battle and succeeded in defeating them . On seeing the Muslim army routed , the defenders remaining in the citadel surrendered . - Pope Urban II ( 29 July 1099), born Odo of Châtillon or Otho de Lagery, was Pope from 12 March 1088 to his death in 1099. He is best known for initiating the First Crusade (109699) and setting up the modern-day Roman Curia in the manner of a royal ecclesiastical court to help run the Church. - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name. - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099. - The Orontes () or Asi (\\"\\") is a northward flowing river starting in Lebanon and flowing through Syria and Turkey before entering the Mediterranean Sea. - Antakya (\\"Anky\\" from , \\"Aniokia\\" \\"Antiócheia\\"), is the seat of the Hatay Province in southern Turkey. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. What is the relationship between 'siege of antioch' and 'antakya'?","completion":"The relationship between the 'Siege of Antioch' and 'Antakya' lies in their geographical connection. The Siege of Antioch took place during the First Crusade in 1097 and 1098, targeting the ancient Greco-Roman city of Antioch on the Orontes, which was a strategically important city on the Crusaders' route to Palestine. Antioch on the Orontes is now in ruins and is located near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey. The modern city of Antakya derives its name from the ancient city of Antioch. Thus, the connection between the Siege of Antioch and Antakya is that the ancient city of Antioch, which was the site of the siege, is situated near the present-day city of Antakya in Turkey."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Samantha likes to clean the house.. [B]. Betty likes to clean the house..","completion":"Samantha is having to replace their vacuum bags frequently, but not Betty, as Samantha likes to clean the house more often. It appears that Samantha has a higher preference for maintaining a spotless environment, which is a reflection of her personality and attitude towards household chores. On the other hand, Betty may have different priorities or might simply enjoy cleaning the house less frequently. It's important not to judge them based on their habits, but rather to appreciate the diversity in their approaches to maintaining their respective living spaces. With different personalities come distinct lifestyle preferences and habits. For instance, some people find comfort in meticulously organizing and cleaning the spaces they inhabit. They derive great satisfaction from putting things in order, ensuring that everything has a place, and completing the tasks necessary to keep their home clean. In this case, Samantha seems to be one of those individuals who genuinely enjoys the process of keeping her house neat and tidy. This could be because she finds it soothing to have a well-organized space or that she simply takes pride in keeping her environment in excellent condition. On the other hand, it is entirely possible that Betty has different priorities when it comes to cleaning and taking care of her home. Perhaps she focuses more on cultivating a warm and welcoming atmosphere rather than an immaculate space. She might spend more time engaging in activities such as cooking, gardening, or spending time with loved ones in her well-used and lived-in home. It's important to remember that just because someone doesn't share the same affinity for cleaning as another doesn't mean they don't care about their home or that their space is any less valuable or enjoyable. Alternatively, maybe Betty simply has a more effective method of cleaning or better tools at her disposal, such as a vacuum cleaner with reusable filters that don't need frequent replacement. In the age of advanced technology, there is a plethora of options available for cleaning appliances that cater to various needs and preferences. It could be that she has chosen a cleaning method, which while still efficient, requires less frequent maintenance. Overall, it is vital to recognize that there are various ways to approach keeping a clean and comfortable home, and each individual is likely to differ in their preferences. Samantha and Betty's contrasting experiences with vacuum bag replacements serve as a useful illustration of this. While Samantha might be content with her routine of changing vacuum bags frequently due to her love for cleaning, Betty might be finding other ways to ensure her house is kept neat and orderly, without the need for constant vacuum bag replacements. Both approaches are valid and suit each person's needs and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who served as Thomaskantor? is inside the article: Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! (Ring out, you songs; sound, you strings!), BWV 172, in Weimar for Pentecost Sunday in 1714. Bach led the first performance on 20 May 1714 in the Schlosskirche, the court chapel in the ducal Schloss. Erschallet, ihr Lieder is an early work in a genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. Bach was appointed Konzertmeister in Weimar in the spring of 1714, a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month. He composed Erschallet, ihr Lieder as the third cantata in the series, to a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck. The text reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit. The librettist included a quotation from the day's prescribed Gospel reading in the only recitative, and for the closing chorale he used a stanza from Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern\\" (1599). The work is in six movements, and scored for four vocal soloists, four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, oboe, bassoon and a string orchestra of two violins, two violas, and basso continuo. The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar. The cantata opens with a chorus, followed by the recitative, in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ). A bass aria with trumpets addresses the Trinity, and a tenor aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the Creation. This is followed by an intimate duet of the Soul (soprano) and the Spirit (alto), to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of Martin Luther's hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\" and a solo cello provides the bass line. The theme of intimacy between God and Man is developed further in the following chorale, after which Bach specified an unusual repeat of the opening chorus.

Here is a question about this article: In the 1820s, Boston's population grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the Irish Potato Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 Irish lived in Boston. In the latter half of the 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settled in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants—Italians inhabited the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community, and since the early 20th century, the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics—prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald. What is the answer to this question: What was the estimated population of Irish people living in Boston in 1850?","completion":"The estimated population of Irish people living in Boston in 1850 was about 35,000. This initial wave of Irish immigrants was largely a result of the Irish Potato Famine, and their arrival significantly changed the ethnic composition of the city. The Irish presence continued to grow throughout the latter half of the 19th century, and they, along with other immigrant groups such as Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews, came to occupy distinct ethnic enclaves in various parts of the city. In particular, Boston's South Boston and Charlestown neighborhoods were heavily dominated by Irish immigrants. In addition to making a significant demographic impact, the Irish community has also profoundly shaped the religious and political character of Boston. For example, the influx of Irish (and Italian) immigrants brought Roman Catholicism to the city, making Catholicism Boston's largest religious community today. Furthermore, the Irish community has long played a major role in Boston politics, with notable figures such as the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald hailing from this background. Hence, the arrival of around 35,000 Irish immigrants in Boston by 1850 marked the beginning of a transformative period in the city's history that continues to influence its cultural, religious, and political life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who disposes of a body? , can you please find it? In 1955 in Portland, Oregon, a businessman finds his wife in bed with another man, and commits a double murder-suicide. His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle. He subsequently picks up a female hitchhiker, who he brings to a local motel in Stanford Bay, and murders her after failing to charm her with his flute-playing. Marion's psychic visions of Paul's murders increase in frequency and intensity, and sh soon witnesses him in person disposing of a body on a rural beach, making her his next target. Marion manages to elude to Paul, but he later discovers where she lives, and infiltrates her home, killing Frank. Struggling to walk, Marion manages to flee her home to an adjacent sawmill, and is pursued by Paul. While chasing Marion, Paul impales a worker with a forklift, and then inadvertently crashes through a barrier, driving the forklift off the pier and into the bay. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The person who disposes of a body in this article is Paul. Paul is the character who, after escaping from a psychiatric institution, goes on a murder spree and is witnessed by Marion disposing of a body on a rural beach. Marion's extrasensory perception, acquired through a blood transfusion from Paul, allows her to see his actions and becomes his next target."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cracking Down on Toxic Makeup Let's put this out there first: I do not know much about cosmetics. I have deodorant and shaving cream and—because I burn in the sun faster than Robert Pattinson in Twilight—lots and lots of sunblock. The average American uses 10 personal care products a day, and I am sub-average. But I do know that government regulation of cosmetics and other personal care products is badly lacking. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may regulate foods and drugs relatively well—with some exceptions—but the agency can't require cosmetics companies to conduct safety assessments, control the labeling of products or force product recalls. Just a fifth of the chemicals in cosmetics have actually been assessed by the FDA's safety panel. As it is for industrial chemicals—as I wrote in TIME this past April—regulation tends to be in name alone, with the cosmetics industry effectively self-policing. And if you think industry can police itself—well, there's a spillcam I'd like to show you. And the chemicals inside many cosmetics—shampoos, moiturizers, lipstick and more—are worth worrying about. Carcinogens like formaldehyde, neurotoxins like lead, endocrine disrupters like phthalates—they're often found, even in just trace amounts, in cosmetics and personal care items. An investigation by the Chicago Tribune in May found that some skin-whitening creams had dangerous levels of mercury, enough to cause kidney damage. I could go on—but Annie Leonard—the author of the book The Story of Stuff and its accompanying film—has made a short web video that tells the tale with much more punch than I could manage. (Especially at 5 PM.) It's the Story of Cosmetics: Alarming stuff—enough to make you want to ditch the eyeshadow and just go natural. But as Leonard points out, real change needs to come not just from the consumer, or even industry, but in the laws that govern cosmetic and chemical regulation. And there's some positive news from Washington: today Representatives Jan Schakowsky, Ed Markey and Tammy Baldwin introduced the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2010. The legislation aims to phase out cosmetic ingredients linked to cancer and developmental harm, improve protection for children and other vulnerable populations and close labeling loopholes that allow companies to classify any number of chemicals under innocuous terms like \\"fragrances.\\" Here's what Schakowsky said in a statement: Harmful chemicals have no place in the products we put on our bodies or on our children's bodies. Our cosmetics laws are woefully out of date—manufacturers aren't even required to disclose all their ingredients on labels, leaving Americans unknowingly exposed to harmful mystery ingredients. This bill will finally protect those consumers. Passing the bill won't easy—the Personal Care Products Council, a trade group for the industry, argues that the legislation would place impossible burdens on the FDA, and that it's \\"not based on credible and established scientific principles.\\" (Meaning theirs.) But at the very least the industry does seem to recognize that it has a problem, and is open to strengthening regulation at the FDA level, which is a start. The truth is that the industry needs stronger regulations as much as the consumer. The science connecting chemicals found in many personal care products to health problems is early and often far from conclusive—but the vague labels and lack of transparency from the FDA is already eroding consumer confidence and trust. You can, if you try very hard, shop your way out of the problem and only buy organic or chemical-free cosmetics. (And if you want to do that, check out the new book No More Dirty Looks, which can help you look good and green.) But most consumers just want to be able to buy products at the drug store and have faith that someone—someone not making a profit on it—is ensuring they're safe. That doesn't seem to much to ask. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the concerns regarding toxic chemicals in makeup and other personal care products. It talks about how the government regulation of cosmetics is not very strong, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't control these products as much as it should. Many cosmetics contain harmful chemicals, like formaldehyde and lead, which can be dangerous. The article also mentions a new law called the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2010, which aims to make cosmetics safer by removing harmful ingredients and improving labels on the products. The writer believes that stronger regulations are needed to protect consumers and make them feel more confident about the safety of the products they use. So, this article is about the need for better rules and laws to keep makeup and other products safe for people to use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Paragraph: Bird city had may economic ties with Pine city.

Answer the following question: Do you blank out or feel so nervous in exams that you have trouble writing answers to questions that you knew just last night? If so, you likely have a case of test anxiety. But, don't be afraid. By recognizing the problem, you are taking the first step towards overcoming it. Believe it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly. This is because under stress, the body releases the hormone adrenaline , which prepares it for something important that will happen. However, too much anxiety can result in sleeplessness, loss of appetite before tests, and poor performance. Some people might feel hot and tired. With great anger they often shout or complain for no reason. If you worry a lot or are a perfectionist, you are more likely to have trouble with test anxiety. Those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety. When you feel a storm of anxiety coming on, stop what you're doing and make your mind a blank. If possible, actually tell yourself to 'STOP!' This will get your mind off the stress. Then think of being at a place of comfort and let your body relax. As you continue the test, find questions you know the answers to and answer them first. This will help restore your confidence. Important of all, talk to yourself using positive language. Make it a habit to replace each negative thought with a logical reason. For example: \\"I've studied hard and I know the material, so I'm ready to do the best I can.\\" Another thing you can do is to learn to accept mistakes. In fact, they can be valuable learning opportunities. Last but not least, start test preparation early - three to five days ahead of the quiz or test. After all, good study habits and skills - for example, time management and note-taking - will give you the feeling that you are in control. What can we infer from the passage? A) Mistakes sometime can be valuable and helpful. B) Those who have prepared poorly for a test cause test anxiety easily. C) Full test preparations will give you the feeling that you are in control.

The computers were reportedly located in the U.S. , Canada and South Korea . The PCs are scattered across the United States , Canada and South Korea .

Sentence 1: Main components: computers, reportedly located, U.S., Canada, South Korea Sentence 2: Main components: PCs, scattered, United States, Canada, South Korea Step 2: Compare the components for similarities and differences. Similarities: - Both sentences refer to computers or PCs - Both sentences mention the same three locations: U.S. / United States, Canada, and South Korea Differences: - Sentence 1 uses the term \\"computers\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"PCs\\". However, these terms can be considered synonymous in most contexts. - Sentence 1 uses \\"reportedly located\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"scattered\\". These two phrases somewhat differ in meaning. \\"Reportedly located\\" implies that the information comes from a source or sources, while \\"scattered\\" simply states that the computers are dispersed across the mentioned locations. Step 3: Determine if the sentences convey the same meaning. Based on the comparison of the main components of both sentences, I can conclude that they convey the same general idea, but with a slight difference in the source of information mentioned and the dispersal of the computers. Since this difference might be considered small, you could say that the sentences mostly convey the same meaning with a slight nuance."},{"prompt":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"It needs repair!

Today we're going to learn about some easy ways to keep our fish friends happy and healthy in their fish tank home. We want to make sure they have the best home possible, so let's learn some tips together. 1. Schedule Weekly Partial Water Changes Remember to change your fish tank's water every week, like you would clean your room. But, instead of changing all the water, we only need to change some of it, like when we take half of the toys out of our toy box. This helps to keep the water clean and fresh so our fish friends can swim and breathe easily. 2. \\"Reset\\" Your Tank with Water Changes Sometimes, we need to reset and refresh things, just like when we're playing a game and want to start over. Doing this for our fish tank means changing a lot of the water. This helps to remove any dirt, extra food, or bad things in the water that can make our fish friends not feel well. By resetting the tank, we make sure our fish have a clean and comfy home to live in. 3. Limit Your Light Usage Fish, like us, need to sleep too! They need some time for rest and relaxation, so we should turn off the fish tank light when it's nighttime. Imagine if you had to sleep with the lights on all the time – you wouldn't like it, right? The same thing goes for our fish friends. Turning off the light also helps to stop any algae from growing too much, which can make the water dirty. 4. Avoid Overfeeding We love giving treats to our pets, but we should remember not to give our fish friends too much food. It's like when we eat too much candy – we can get a tummy ache. Overfeeding can also make the fish tank water dirty because the extra food turns into waste. Make sure to give your fish friends just the right amount of food to help them stay happy and healthy. Now that we've learned these simple tips, we can make sure our fish friends have the best home possible. And every time you take care of your fish tank, remember that you're being a great and responsible pet owner!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The album was generally well received. Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin. Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \\"Fortunately Gone\\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in Blender likened it to a poorly-constructed building. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described it unfavorably as more \\"art project\\" than the work of a band, and Greg Sandow in Entertainment Weekly felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.Wif Stenger of Trouser Press called the first side \\"a bit shaky\\" but considered side 2 to be \\"damn near perfect\\". NME's Steve Lamacq described the album as \\"a tight-ish piece of tantalising rock\\", and said that listeners who found it too minimalist would soon warm to it. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times praised Pod's intelligence and originality. Answer:","completion":"Taylor"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At the beginning of the Three Kingdoms era (220–280 CE), Zhejiang was home to the warlords Yan Baihu and Wang Lang prior to their defeat by Sun Ce and Sun Quan, who eventually established the Kingdom of Wu. Despite the removal of their court from Kuaiji to Jianye (present-day Nanjing), they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern China.

Along with Manchuria, where did trade reach as far as?","completion":"Trade during the Three Kingdoms era in Zhejiang, specifically under the rule of Sun Ce and Sun Quan who established the Kingdom of Wu, reached as far as two distinct regions. The first region is Manchuria, which is located in the northeastern part of China. Manchuria was historically significant for its abundant resources, which made it a pivotal area for trade. The other region is Funan, an ancient pre-Angkor kingdom located around the Mekong Delta, largely corresponding to modern-day mainland Southeast Asia including South Vietnam. Funan played a crucial role in the trade routes connecting China with Southeast Asia and the broader Indian Ocean commerce. It was significant for its productive agriculture, especially the production of rice, and also for its strategic trade location. Therefore, despite upheavals in the northern regions of China causing a massive influx of refugees, the early Kingdom of Wu under Sun Ce and Sun Quan was able to strengthen its economic framework. This prosperity is demonstrated by the reach of Zhejiang's trade routes to both Manchuria and Funan, underlining the kingdom's vast trade network and its involvement in commercial activities during the Three Kingdoms period. The establishment of industrial kilns further reflected the kingdom's efforts in strengthening its industrial foundation, leading to a prosperous era of trade and development."},{"prompt":"Background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Paragraph: Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Martha De Lacey. Jill Greenberg is bored with the 'controversy' rumbling around her photographs. The portrait artist's beautifully stylised and highly emotive images of very young, damp-cheeked children sobbing up close to her camera lens drew accusations of 'child abuse' when they were first seen in 2006. But the New York-based mother-of-two, who has now released a collection of the photos as a stunning hardback art book with D.A.P. and Madrid-based TF Editores, says she had no intention of creating such a stir with her images, and was shocked to have actually received hate mail as a result of them. The Truth: Jill Greenberg's photos depict crying children but were intended to reflect her dissatisfaction with Bush-era politics in 2006. The Rapture Index: Jill Greenberg used her daughter, her daughter's friends and some child models in the photos. Speaking to MailOnline, Greenberg said: 'Children at that age cry as a form of communication since they can't use their words, its not evidence of pain.' 'Making children cry for a photographer can be considered mean,' she continued in Slate Magazine. speaking to Jordan G Teicher. 'But I. would say that making children laugh and show off their jeans for an. apparel ad is just as exploitative and less natural. Toddlers' natural. state, like 30 per cent of the time, is crying.' To get the children welling up, Greenberg and the infants' mothers would offer the tots sweets and chocolate or something just as tantalising, such as a mobile phone, then stop short of handing them over, prompting a tantrum. In a statement about the collection on her website, Greenberg says: 'Nothing is more pure than the anguish of a child. Pictures of children crying capture raw emotion: sputtering rage and profound loss. 'In many ways we’ve become desensitized to disturbing image. But the honesty of a child's feelings is undeniable and it draws you in to the photograph. Perhaps because kids experience the kind of powerful emotions that we, as adults, have suppressed in ourselves.' Greenberg said: 'Children at that age cry as a form of communication since they can't use their words, its not evidence of pain' In a statement about the collection, Greenberg said: 'Nothing is more pure than the anguish of a child. Pictures of children crying capture raw emotion: sputtering rage and profound loss' Continuing, she wrote: 'The children I photographed were not harmed in any way. And, as a mother, I am quite aware of how easily toddlers can cry. Storms of grief sweep across their features without warning; a joyful smile can dissolve into a grimace of despair. 'The first little boy I shot, Liam, suddenly became hysterically upset. It reminded me of helplessness and anger I feel about our current political and social situation. 'It made me think of my outrage at our false reasons for going to war in Iraq and the scandalous way in which the conflict was sold to the American people. I thought of George W. Bush, then just sworn into his second term in office, and I decided to call the image \\"Four More Years\\". Shock: 'The first little boy I shot, Liam, suddenly became hysterically upset. It reminded me of helplessness and anger I feel about our current political and social situation' She said: 'As a parent I have to reckon with the knowledge that our children will suffer for the mistakes our government is making. Their pain is a precursor of that is to come' 'As any new parent will tell you, the future suddenly becomes a very serious concern. As ecstatic as I was at the birth of my daughter, I felt selfish bringing her, and later my son into our screwed-up world. I seemed to become a mother at exactly the moment things went awry. 'Of course, human beings have always been greedy, violent and dishonest. But the rise of the Christian right as a political force in this country has made the situation dire. The most dangerous fundamentalists aren’t just waging war in Iraq; they're attacking evolution, blocking medical research and ignoring the environment. 'It's as if they believe the apocalyptic End Time is near, therefore protecting the earth and the future of all our children is futile. As a parent I have to reckon with the knowledge that our children will suffer for the mistakes our government is making. Their pain is a precursor of that is to come.' Trillions: 'As any new parent will tell you, the future suddenly becomes a very serious concern.

'The children I photographed were not harmed in any way. And, as a mother, I am quite aware of how easily toddlers can cry' Jill Greenberg isn't the only parent to have snapped children at their most teary moments. The father behind hit Tumblr photo blog Reasons My Son Is Crying has been exploring the 'universal culture of toddler' using photos of his two sons - and the children of people from around the world - sobbing. Greg Pembroke, from Rochester, New York, began taking mid-tantrum photos. of his infant sons Charlie, 22 months, and William, three-and-a-half,. and captioning the images with the (mostly unreasonable) reasons for the. boys' tears. The. hilarious tags range from 'I broke his cheese in half' and 'I wiped the. dirt off his pear', to 'we asked him to stop hitting his brother with a. plastic wand' and 'his milk was in the wrong cup'. We let him play on the grass - submitted by Trish, Sydney, Australia. I sneezed - submitted by Sofia, Stockholm,. Sweden, left; and he wasn't allowed to scald himself with hot tea -. submitted by Tomoe, Tokyo, Japan, right. Pembroke - who writes commercials for. radio stations and is married to Charity, a physical therapist -. initially began his light-hearted hobby by posting images and captions. on his personal Facebook page. But when friends began telling him they wanted to share his jokes with their own friends, they encouraged him to launch a blog. Within five days his Tumblr page had. gone viral, and was being featured in news outlets, websites and. magazines all over the world. The family were invited to talk on Good. Morning America. We would not let him drive this Porsche - submitted by Chris. We took away his baby powder - submitted by. Jessica T, Texas, USA, left; and her mother didn't pick her up quickly. enough - submitted by Cherry, Shunde, China, right. Speaking to MailOnline, Pembroke. said: 'It's so interesting. I started it for a bit of fun, and it got. big completely by accident. The first photo we did was the cheese one. I. broke it in half after he asked me to, and when he got upset I thought. his reaction was so hilariously unreasonable. It went from there. 'The. best bit is that I've been getting emails from all over the world from. people saying they find it so relatable. It doesn't matter where in the. world you are, the universal culture of toddler is the same.' He continued: 'Some. of the funniest contributions I've had are one from Australia with a. picture. of a little boy crying his face off because his mother unwrapped a. chocolate biscuit. Then there's a little girl in China whose mum didn't. pick her up quickly enouigh, and a girl in South Korea who is literally. crying over. spilled milk.' I broke his cheese in half. I asked him to thank his brother for sharing Buzz Lightyear, left, and I closed the refrigerator door, right. Pembroke is now publishing global. contributions to his site, and has launched a contest to find the. funniest reason for a child crying, with the best one winning a digital. camera, donated to him by Sony. He said: 'I have gotten so many great pictures that I wanted to find a way to recognize some of them.' Greg and his wife will pick the 10 best submissions and put them to a vote on Tumblr.

Smaller capacitors like ceramics, however, use a shorthand consisting of three numeric digits and a letter, where the digits indicate the capacitance in pF (calculated as XY × 10Z for digits XYZ) and the letter indicates the tolerance (J, K or M for ±5%, ±10% and ±20% respectively). Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What part of the electrical characteristics of smaller capacitors do the digits of the abbreviated notation represent ?","completion":"The digits of the abbreviated notation on smaller capacitors, specifically ceramics, represent the capacitance of the capacitor in picofarads (pF). This abbreviated notation consists of three numeric digits, which are used to calculate the capacitance value. This is done in a particular way for these capacitors. The first two numbers (XY) in the code are taken at face value, and they represent the significant figures of the capacitance. The third number (Z) is a multiplier, and that's used as a power of 10. The resulting value, XY × 10 Z, gives the capacitance in pF. For example, if the numeric code is 104, it would translate to a capacitance of 10 x 10⁴ pF, or 100,000 pF, which is also equivalent to 0.1 microfarads (μF) since 1μF = 1,000,000 pF. This shorthand is a method used to convey detailed information in a small amount of space, which is necessary given the small size of these types of capacitors.

The Paladins believe that a normal mechanic named David (played by Chris Evans), who lives and works in the city, not only holds the secret to an ancient artifact with immense power but that he is also destined to bring about worldwide destruction. Led by the charismatic cult leader Bishop (played by Jared Harris), the Paladins systematically hunt and attempt to capture David, convinced that his death will save the world from the proclaimed prophecy. When the group strikes close to home, taking David's sister Emily (played by Emma Stone) hostage as leverage, David goes on the run. Desperate to save her, he crosses paths with Seth, a former Paladin member (played by Idris Elba), who now seeks redemption for a dark past. Seth informs David of the prophetic artifact, called the Elysium Orb, and how it is linked to a hidden chamber underneath Edenton's oldest church, all while deciphering ancient scrolls. As David and Seth unravel the truth behind the town's history and the origins of the Paladins' religious zeal, they discover that another mysterious and powerful organization, known as The Guardians, created the prophecy to keep the Elysium Orb hidden and out of the hands of the wrong people. Betrayed by his own beliefs, Bishop becomes obsessed with finding the Orb first and using it to assume control over those who created the false prophecy. Despite being pursued by the Paladins, David and Seth devise a plan to infiltrate and topple the power-hungry sect. A string of intricate schemes and intense action sequences take place as the duo attempt to outsmart and outplay their enemies while trying to rescue Emily before any harm comes to her. In a riveting climax, David, Seth, and Emily confront Bishop in the hidden chamber beneath the church as he retrieves the Elysium Orb. David, armed with newfound strength and understanding, battles Bishop and successfully defeats him. The Orb's energy transforms David, revealing him as the rightful protector of the artifact. With Bishop now vanquished, the Paladins dissolve, and peace is restored to the city of Edenton. In the end, the truth of the prophecy, and David's unique destiny, is revealed not as destruction but rather as a protector and guardian of humanity's balance. The Guardians, their mission now complete, fade into the shadows. David, Emily, and Seth embark on a new life together, starting anew while safeguarding the Elysium Orb's power and mystery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Numerous Roman sites are scattered around present-day Portugal, some urban remains are quite large, like Conímbriga and Mirobriga. The former, beyond being one of the largest Roman settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a National Monument. Conímbriga lies 16 km from Coimbra which by its turn was the ancient Aeminium).

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight. Which group has a smaller chance of getting more health problems? A:","completion":"Group Yellow, the group that maintained a normal diet, has a smaller chance of getting more health problems. According to the information given, the overconsumption of calories leads to an increase in stored body fat, which if persistent can result in obesity. Obesity, defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 kg/m^2 or greater, is associated with increased risks for a number of health issues, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Group Brown, which consumed 3500 extra calories per day for three months, would have experienced significant weight gain due to the overconsumption of energy. This would make them more susceptible to obesity and therefore associated health problems. In contrast, Group Yellow maintained a normal diet. If they were consuming a calorie-appropriate diet for their energy needs, then they would be less likely to gain excess weight or become obese. Thus, they are at a lower risk for obesity-associated health concerns compared to Group Brown. However, it's important to note that a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and an overall healthy lifestyle are key in reducing the risk of health problems, not just maintaining a normal diet. Other factors could come into play such as genetics, age, and underlying health conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When you do acts of good like help at a shelter or soup kitchen, it's part of being a Christian. Search online for shelters in your area and give them a call during business hours to inquire about opportunities to volunteer. In Proverbs 21:13 it says \\"Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out and not be answered.\\" The church that you go to will probably be involved in some programs in your town to help others. Some churches will take missions to go to poorer countries and help the people there and disaster response, while others concentrate on improving the neighborhood. Call your local church and inquire about any volunteer opportunities available. The Bowery Mission in New York City is one example of a church with volunteer opportunities to help the homeless. Things that they might have you do is feed the poor, clean up a community space, or help fix up or repair things at the church itself. In Galatians 3:28 it says, \\"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\\" This can be interpreted to mean that regardless of their beliefs or nationalities, you should treat all people with dignity and respect.

Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Understanding How Women Network Whether through online social networking or face-to-face contact, women are meeting, sharing and connecting in ways that men often shy away from. The result is lasting relationships that are the building blocks of future job placements, sales leads and partnerships. We're dissecting the ins and outs of the way women network differently than men--with the experts weighing in on the how, why and a lesson on building connections with the guys. Do women network differently than men? In a word, yes. \\"Men don't actually network the way women define networking,\\" says Gail Blanke, a life coach and author of Throw Out Fifty Things: Clear the Clutter, Find Your Life. They do what she calls \\"a straight shot.\\" The narrative looks like this: A man thinks, \\"Who do I know who has what I need right now?\\"--could be a job, investment tip or tickets to the game--and then he asks for it. Simple. Women are generally more complex. \\"We see things from a lot of different angles, not just one straight-lined route, and so we take a roundabout route,\\" says Blanke. In an effort to personalize professional networking, women normally try to create connections or friendships. \\"Before we think, 'What can this person do for me,' we ask, 'What can I do for her in order to get what I need.'\\" In many cases this give-and-then-take style of networking builds long-lasting relationships. \\"Connecting is what it's all about for women,\\" says Blanke. Think LinkedIn: \\"Even if she can't help me, maybe she knows somebody who can or will think of me at some point in the future when she needs somebody. In other words, the connection is not wasted, even if there's no immediate transaction.\\" What are the benefits of building these relationships? \\"Women are really good listeners, and, even at a networking event, we listen to what the other person needs so that we can help to make that happen,\\" continues Blanke. \\"Out of that comes trust. And out of that--perhaps--comes a new business contact, new boyfriend or play dates for your kids. That works for women.\\" Underscoring the point, Sonya Shelton, a leadership consultant and founder of Being Present to Win, describes women's style of networking as mutually beneficial \\"added value.\\" \\"Women help each other build our businesses and our networks,\\" says Shelton. \\"We can also share what we're learning, reach out to each other as thought-partners and have more access to best practices within our industry.\\" What's the downside to making personal connections when networking for business? \\"I love your handbag,\\" says a woman next to you at an industry event as you're waiting in line for a glass of Chardonnay. By the time you've tipped the bartender, you've discovered she shares your favorite designers and also has two elementary school-age kids. You exchange business cards and part with a new friend. Now that you have a personal connection, you recommend her for a job--or perhaps hire her yourself. Well, it's really uncomfortable if it doesn't work out, right? After all, she's your \\"friend.\\" \\"Sometimes creating these intimate connections in networking can backfire,\\" says Dawn Todd, founder of Wildly Successful Woman Network, a membership-based network of female entrepreneurs. \\"Still, if you've developed a real and honest relationship, you can go to her and say, 'My experience with your service didn't accomplish what I thought it would. And as someone who cares about you, I want to help you.' Now your relationship--both personally and professionally--can move forward.\\" Where's the line between networking and friendship? It's called pragmatism. \\"Many women would benefit from drawing a harder line between networking relationships and personal relationships,\\" says Karen Burns, author of The Amazing Adventures of Working Girl: Real Life Career Advice You Can Actually Use. In networking, your goal is to \\"sell yourself\\" so you appear responsible, reliable and smart. Sharing TMI that makes you look otherwise can backfire. Off the table: sex, politics, drinking escapades and, well, you get the picture. \\"Yes, it's good to be open and real but keep the impression you're making in mind.\\" How do I develop networking skills with men? Men and women have very different brains and they do network differently, says Helen Fisher, Ph.D., biological anthropologist at Rutgers University and author of Why Him, Why Her. \\"The male brain is more compartmentalized; they get straight to the point, they know the goal. They tend to decide right away, with little to no small-talk, whether they will work with you or not.\\" If you know what you want, ask for it. Drop the small talk. And if you are going to make small talk, make boy small talk, not girl talk. And get to the point. Are You Networking Or Self-Promoting? Get Ahead By Reaching Out Enjoy this story? Keep reading at ForbesWoman. Summary:","completion":"This news article is about how women network differently than men. When women connect with others, they usually try to make friends and help each other. This can lead to long-lasting relationships that help them find jobs and other opportunities. Men usually just ask for what they need right away.

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing.

As a result, clients who have booked a grooming session after the current one may have to wait longer than planned for their turn. This can lead to a delay in their grooming services, making them potentially late or causing inconveniences to their schedule.

It can lead to stress and dissatisfaction for all parties involved - clients might feel rushed or unhappy about the waiting time, and the groomers might have to rush through the following appointments to catch up with their schedule. To prevent these situations, it's essential to be proactive in managing grooming appointments. This can include giving extra buffer time between appointments, ensuring that the groomer is experienced and well-trained, managing the workload efficiently, and communicating any potential delays to the affected clients as early as possible.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I picked up this Sporf in Amsterdam Schipol airport. A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Mangoes are cut into two halves in the middle horizontally....I think the answer is","completion":"B). Let's examine both options to determine which is the more reasonable method for cutting a mango. Option A: Cutting mangoes into slices from its meaty portion and then carving out the rest of the mango from the inner seed. - Step 1: Identify the Mango's cheeks by locating the widest part of the mango, which are the two sides extending from both ends of the flat seed. - Step 2: Slice each cheek off from the mango by cutting about a 1/4-inch away from the center of the mango that contains the seed. - Step 3: Using a spoon or knife, separate the mango fruit from the skin by sliding it under the flesh. - Step 4: Cut the mango flesh into slices or cubes, depending on your preference. - Step 5: Using the same technique, remove the remaining fruit from around the seed on both ends, be cautious of the slippery mango seed. Option B: Cutting mangoes into two halves in the middle horizontally. - Step 1: Place the mango with the stem facing upwards, locate the wider sides of the mango. - Step 2: Cut horizontally through the center of the mango, trying to avoid the flat seed in the middle. Since the seed runs along the center of the fruit, there is a high chance that cutting it horizontally will result in waste. - Step 3: After successfully cutting the mango into two halves, separate the mango flesh from the skin and cut it into the desired pieces. In conclusion, Option A is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of how to best cut a mango. This method ensures minimal waste and more control while cutting the mango around the seed. It also allows for easier extraction of the mango flesh with the use of a spoon or knife, and provides a better presentation if slicing or creating cubes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round. But I can use this background: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released. What is an answer for this question: Which body of water had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge ? Answer:","completion":"Considering the background provided, it is more probable that Twin I, the lake with cooler water temperatures, would have fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge compared to Twin II, the lake with warmer water. There are a few key reasons behind this conclusion. Henry’s Law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas, and temperature affects this solubility. When the temperature of water increases, dissolved oxygen - a gas - becomes less soluble in it. This means that when warm water is used to cool industrial machinery and then released back into a body of water, it is less able to dissolve and hold oxygen than cooler water. This is of particular importance because oxygen is crucial for the organisms living in bodies of water. It is used by aquatic life such as fish and plankton to breathe, and they cannot live in water that doesn't have enough oxygen. Dissolved oxygen is also morally crucial for the process of decomposition. Therefore, if industrial discharge were to occur near the two lakes, Twin I, with its consistently cooler water, would be more capable of maintaining greater levels of dissolved oxygen after coming into contact with the discharged warm water used to cool machinery. Cooler water has a greater ability to hold dissolved oxygen, so the impact of the industrial discharge would likely be less severe in Twin I than Twin II. On the other hand, Twin II, being warmer year-round, is already predisposed to holding less dissolved oxygen to begin with, as per Henry's law. If warm water from industrial discharge were to be released into Twin II, the ability of the water to hold oxygen would decline even further. This could potentially lead to the creation of anoxia, or oxygen-depleted conditions, which could harm aquatic life and overall ecosystem health. In addition, anoxia can lead to the growth of certain bacteria that produce toxins harmful not only to aquatic life but also to humans who might come into contact with the water. Thus, Twin II would likely face a more significant impact from industrial discharge due to its year-round warm temperatures. In conclusion, Twin I, the colder of the two Twin lakes, would hypothetically face fewer issues from the release of warm industrial discharge because its cooler water is naturally more capable of maintaining higher levels of dissolved oxygen, thus promoting a more stable and healthy aquatic ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Whales of August Movie plot: The Whales of August tells the story of two elderly widowed sisters near the end of their lives, spending a summer in a seaside house in Maine. The surroundings cause them to recall their relationship as young women, and the summers they had enjoyed there in the past. They reflect on the passage of time, and the bitterness, jealousies and misunderstandings that slowly festered over the years and kept them from establishing a true closeness in their relationship. Libby, played by Davis, is the elder and the more infirm of the two sisters, and her nature has become bitter and cold as a result. Sarah, played by Gish, is the younger sister, a softer and more tolerant character, intent on nursing her sister through her discomfort and trying to breach the gulf that has grown between them. The resentment that Libby so clearly displays to her stifles Sarah's every attempt at making a friendly overture towards her, and Sarah cautiously retreats from her. Ironically, Gish was actually 15 years older than Davis. Maranov (Price) is an expatriate from Russia who has recently lost the friend that he has been living with. Tisha (Sothern) is a vivacious lifelong friend who provides common sense, fun and laughter, and is the catalyst for some of the sisters' conversations and revelations.

Furthermore, the speaker mentions their enjoyment teaching, suggesting that whatever job they are currently doing involves an educational element, reinforcing the use of their education. Plus, there’s a hint about uncertainty when they say, \\"..who knows what'll happen in the future,\\" suggesting that the application of their education might further evolve or change depending on their future career trajectory.

Q: As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

Cover the pot and cook until the rice is tender. Allow the rice to sit in the pot for several minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.","completion":"Title: The Perfect Way to Cook Rice: A Simple and Foolproof Method Introduction: Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the world. It comes in various types and forms, but one thing that brings them all together is the art of cooking it perfectly. While there are plenty of methods to cook rice, this simple and foolproof method will guarantee perfectly fluffy and tender rice every time. Follow these easy steps to become a master of cooking rice. Step 1: Rinse the Rice Rinsing the rice is an essential first step in preparing it for cooking. This process helps to remove any debris, excess starch, or impurities that may be present. To rinse the rice, place it in a strainer or fine-mesh sieve and run cold water over it, gently agitating it with your hands or a spoon. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear. Rinsing not only cleans the rice, but it also prevents it from sticking together during cooking, ensuring fluffy and separate grains. Step 2: Bring the Water to a Boil Start by measuring the correct amount of water according to the type of rice you're cooking and the desired texture. Different types of rice require different water to rice ratios. For instance, long-grain white rice typically requires a 2:1 ratio (water to rice). Check the rice packaging for specific instructions or consult a trusted recipe. Pour the water into a pot and bring it to a rolling boil over medium to high heat. It's important to wait until the water reaches a full, rolling boil before adding the rice, as this will ensure the rice cooks evenly. Step 3: Add Rice and Salt to the Pot Once the water is boiling, add the rinsed rice and a pinch of salt. The salt helps to enhance the flavor of the rice and can be adjusted according to your personal taste. Step 4: Cover and Cook After adding the rice and salt, give the mixture a quick stir to ensure that it is evenly distributed in the pot. Then cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and reduce the heat to low. This will help to maintain a gentle simmer, which is ideal for cooking rice. The cooking time will vary depending on the type of rice being used. For example, white rice typically takes about 18-20 minutes to cook, while brown rice can take 30-40 minutes. Be sure to keep an eye on the time and avoid lifting the lid too often, as this may cause the rice to cook unevenly. Step 5: Allow Rice to Sit and Fluff Once the rice is fully cooked and all of the water has been absorbed, remove the pot from the heat and allow the rice to sit, covered, for an additional 5-10 minutes. This resting period enables the rice to continue cooking gently in its own steam, resulting in perfectly tender and fluffy rice. After the rice has rested, gently fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. Be sure to use a light touch, as vigorous stirring or mashing can result in sticky or clumpy rice. Conclusion: With these easy and foolproof steps, anyone can master the art of cooking perfect rice. Whether it's for a simple side dish or as the base for a more elaborate meal, following this method will guarantee tender, fluffy, and delicious rice every time. So, the next time you cook rice, give this simple yet effective method a try, and enjoy the tasty results!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
