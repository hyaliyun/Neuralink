Now it is only practiced by some hardworking people and other people who like the classical way of life. We have switched this tradition to modern global working methods. Everyone wakes up at what we call Al-Fajr; the time between dawn and sunrise. Religious people starts the day by prying, then you eat breakfast and you go to work between 6:00 AM and 7:30 AM, this depends on the type of person you are. Lunch break is at 1:00 PM. Both My grand parents came back home at 1:00 to eat with the family then they went back to work. Work ends between 4:00 and 5:00. Some people stay later, like one of my grand parent who only came back slightly before sunset, but thats because he owned his own company and was not an employee. People usually try to make it home before what we call Maghreb; sunset. Modern Working Program: Work starts at 9:00 and ends at 5:00 with a lunch break at 12:00. This is the way 90% of the people work nowadays The remaining 10% includes the people who are still working traditionally and people like some of the ones you noticed who prefer to work at night. Note: In some of the gulf countries there are some lazy habits. These do not represent the majority, but they are the ones we notice most because of their life style. When you have enough Mony, you can employ someone else to do the work so you do not need to wake up early. This habits does not occurs only in the Gulf but you will notice it in many countries. The Gulf is very rich in oil and some countries have low populations sharing this wealth, like UAE, hence more rich people. This behaviour in the gulf started only in Modern time. In the past when people practiced traditional jobs, e.g. shepherd, Fisherman, Carpenter, Trading, ..etc. they used the traditional working program."},{"prompt":"Can India, Russia, North Korea, & China together defeat the USA alone in a war, if it happens in 2025?

BUT I LOVE ALL THE PEOPLE EQUALLY . :-) There are a few arguments which should be taken into consideration before getting to any kind of conclusions regarding the military might of the U.S.A.(which is currently indisputable ) and the outcome of such a hypothetical situation.Some of these are- 1.India was able to avert the surveillance of sophisticated US satellites while covertly developing the test site for POKHARAN-II. 2.India is not a signatory to the CTBT(Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) and the NPT (Non Proliferation Treaty) and keeping in mind the above-mentioned adroitness of India in carrying out surreptitious defense innovation ,who knows what they have in their pocket. 3.There is no known existence of number of nuclear missiles that India has and I for that matter don't think there is going to be disclosure of any such kind in the future. Until then there can only be infinite conjectures. 4.China recently overtook Canada as the largest trading partner of the US and think of a war like situation where all the trading contacts may be disabled-economic turmoil ! 5.India and China both combined makes up for more than 2/3 rd of the population of the world .The sheer number is enough to overwhelm any military power and people in India(being one of them) or any other country would happily die fighting for their country. 6.America lost a war against relatively weak country like Vietnam and the war in Iraq and Afghanistan couldn't be classified as a successful invasions as well . 7.Asians(both Indians and Chinese) are extremely efficient when it comes to cost-cutting. For example, the recent Mangalyaan project (mars orbiter ) had a budget less than the hollywood movie ,Gravity.Therefore,even though the annual defense budget is only a fraction of what the US spends, but we are a bit stingy :-P Einstien once said \\"‚ÄúI know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.‚Äù So lets just collectively work towards a brighter future where there is no such thing as a WAR but only PEACE ."},{"prompt":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","completion":"Personal car leasing generally has the lowest downpayment of the 3 primary finance kinds, adhered to by a repaired collection ofregular monthly repayments that are straight associated with the car'srecurring value at the end of the agreement.

The primary aim of diabetes medication is to keep blood sugar levels under control to prevent complications. There are different classes of medications for diabetes, including: Metformin: This medication is usually the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. It helps to reduce the amount of glucose produced by the liver and improve insulin sensitivity.Insulin: This hormone is used to treat type 1 diabetes and sometimes type 2 diabetes. It helps to lower blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells.Sulfonylureas: This class of medications helps to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin.DPP-4 inhibitors: These medications help to increase insulin production and decrease the amount of glucose produced by the liver.GLP-1 agonists: These medications help to increase insulin production and slow down digestion to reduce the amount of glucose released into the bloodstream.SGLT2 inhibitors: These medications help to reduce blood sugar levels by causing the kidneys to remove excess glucose from the body through urine. The choice of medication will depend on individual factors, and it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best medication and dosage for a diabetic patient. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management can also help to manage diabetes. [LINKED_TEXT: Kup Glikotril w bardzo niskiej cenie. Ceny, recenzje.

Among them, coir based mattresses are fabricated using the fibers from outer husk of a coconut. Due to their organic nature, they are very well suited for the people who are allergic to synthetic substances. The greatest advantage of such mattresses is that they are very well ventilated and thus provide enhanced hygroscopic properties, i.e., they impart great air circulation and moisture absorption characteristics. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the [LINKED_TEXT: bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user‚Äôs body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. On the other hand, foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or others who prefer body hugging comfort. In fact, due to their therapeutic properties, memory foam mattresses are commonly known by their secondary name - Orthopedic Mattresses. While, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. They also tend to be marginally more ‚Äòbouncy‚Äô than their memory foam counterparts. So, those who prefer less sunken sitting/lying experience would find PU foam mattresses a great choice. A great advantage of PU foam mattresses is that they are relatively light in weight as compared to the other two configurations. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should opt for relative to the dimensions of the bed, and awareness about the ways by which some brands resort to cutting production costs by using low-grade materials in the fabrication of the mattresses, that cause several neck and spine issues, too play crucial roles in determining the product one should opt for. I gained in-depth knowledge about them from the post - [LINKED_TEXT: Vibhor Shergill's answer to The extensive guide to purchasing a new Mattress.] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] So, today, i.e., 1st November, 2021, at 2:57 PM, I placed the order for my mattress, keeping the insights gained in consideration.

They can give you an entirely different perspective on life. This may sound over exaggerated, but I really mean it. Having someone that close to you that is the opposite gender can be very educational in how the opposite gender's life is like. I mean, I never understood how much periods suck (and I still don't entirely understand) until I met my best friends. I've had long comversations on lingerie with them as well, learning how they pick such things, etc. I learned how they view themselves, and how that impacts how they dress. They are also very useful for checking you (in the terms of checks and balances). They can tell you when you are showing your interest in a woman a bit too much, or whether what your wearing even looks half decent in the eyes of most women, or how about being able to tell you why everyone's reacting X way because you have no idea how to read people's emotions. While all of this comes from my experience with female friends, I'm sure the inverse applies with male friends. The point of all of this is that they provide a counter point to the natural weaknesses of your gender, and can enlighten you in the way that the other gender generally thinks. Kind of like a significant other but minus the romance and sex. So in other words, pretty damn awesome."},{"prompt":"Can I let my pet rat go into the wild?","completion":"As far as your intelligent pet rat putting the rat into the wild who has hopefully never been in prison in a cage, rats are smart and the rat may do well, if you slowly put food out daily for the rat to find and far away from human rats noise and traffic."},{"prompt":"Movies, Bowling, Axe Throwing & More | Cinergy Entertainme","completion":"This is an excellent question.

Using biometrics as your primary form of authentication breaks the most fundamental rules of authentication: everyone on earth knows your password, and your password can‚Äôt be changed. I‚Äôm reminded of a story that may be apocryphal: when the Soviet Union collapsed, carjacking skyrocketed in Russia. Wealthy Russians started having fingerprint sensors installed in the ignition to keep the car from starting again if it was carjacked. So car thieves started carrying bolt cutters‚Ä¶to cut off the owners‚Äô fingers. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true or not, but it does illustrate a point: biometrics can be defeated.

Depending on the policies of the service provider, you may be able to obtain the call history through a request process. Legal Requirements: In some countries, there may be legal requirements for service providers to maintain and disclose call history data under certain circumstances, such as investigations by law enforcement agencies or court orders. Access: To access call history data, you will typically need to have access to the mobile phone account associated with the number. This means that if you are not the owner of the account, you may need to obtain permission from the account owner or have a legal basis for accessing the information. In general, it is not easy for an individual to access the call history of a mobile phone number without authorization or a legal basis. However, if you have a legitimate reason for needing to access the call history, you may be able to do so through the appropriate channels, such as contacting the service provider or working with law enforcement."},{"prompt":"here been an increase in UFO activity since the Voyager satellite left our solar system?","completion":"It doesn‚Äôt seem so.

How long could they sustain the war?","completion":"Chindia has ZERO chance at defeating the USA, because neither of their militaries were designed to project power beyond their respective backyards, and have only recently (2015) been making baby steps to project power in each other's backyards. Both countries may be growing faster than the USA, but their economies are not the size of the USA, and also not spending anywhere near what the Americans spend on maintaining and building up the military, in absolute terms and per capita. On top of that, the United States has the only military in the world capable of projecting power to every square meter of this planet, today. How? USAF runs airborne gas stations for any airplane in their fleet anywhere in the world. That means it could keep harassing the air defences and, assuming they take them all out, the ground and naval forces of their enemies around the clock. It also has the world's only stealth bomber that has ultra long range even before mid-air refuelling, and can deliver a nuclear strike to any point on Earth and make it back home safely. No nukes, no problem. Fill that hefty bomb bay with other stuff. The USN operates 11 (max 13) sovereign pieces of the United States of America that can park off the coast of any place in the world, and each piece is more powerful than a majority of the entire countries' military forces. And finally, the Americans operate one of the best submarine forces in the world. Even taking the SSBN out of the equation, the hunter killer fleet posing a grave threat to any navy the USA is up against. Chinese and Indian submarine forces are improving at fairly good rate, but they can't beat the decades head start that the USN has in this game. But does that mean the US can defeat China? Hell no. How did the Americans win their Revolution? By not fighting the British on their terms. The Americans could not field a better conventional army against the Redcoats, and every time they did, they got their asses kicked. Chindia would be crazy to engage the USN and USAF on equal terms. So they won't. Missiles are much cheaper than aircraft carriers and ships. India has a very fast supersonic cruise missile the Brahmos series. China is going for the ballistic missile approach with its DF-21 by showering the target with multiple warheads rather than one warhead on a missile per target. And it works: By the way, even if Chindia cannot use nukes, their ICBMs could still be loaded with non-nuclear warheads and target US airbases nearby or even in the homeland. After dealing with unknown thousands of missile salvos, the PLAAF and IAF will grind down the surviving USAF, USN and USMC aircraft in a painful battle of attrition, with home field advantage. Perhaps the Americans may win, but it would be a pyrrhic victory of unparalleled magnitude. Giving the US the benefit of the doubt of being able to completely wipe out the Chinese and Indian air forces and navies, and survive the assault of their entire missile inventory, the Americans can finally land some soldiers on Chinese or Indian soil... Good luck winning the inevitable guerrilla war and counterinsurgency, except we're not talking about Al Qaeda or Daesh nutcases here, but patriotic professional soldiers fighting Imperialism 2.0 with the memories of foreign occupation relatively fresh in the national psyche. America has ZERO chance of defeating Team Chindia. China and India might run out of tanks and artillery, but they won't run out of resourcefulness, ingenuity, perseverance, or people: Did I mention that Chindia has a lot of people? LOL good luck killing all of us. By the way, as this way rages, the world economy collapses, and the biggest losers would be these three countries. This war has zero chance of happening."},{"prompt":"What is the shortest skirt you would wear in public?","completion":"A mid thigh"},{"prompt":"Do autopilot systems in some way diminish the natural skills and reflexes of pilots?","completion":"Not aware of research on this but the logical answer would be yes."},{"prompt":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","completion":"I used to blow in my kids‚Äô faces when they misbehaved.

First half for an emergency fund just in case that you don‚Äôt touch unless an emergency presents itself. The second half to save for relevant investments in an investment vehicle that floats your boat. If this is shares, then this half is to contribute towards building a shares portfolio.

And, ensure you crunch the numbers big time. What you may potentially achieve is a superannuation account that will stand you in good stead for when you retire; an emergency fund that will assist to weather any financial storm that an emergency might bring with it; and building an investment portfolio that hopefully is there for the long term and which is not to be sneezed at.

Ant man and The Wasp are also not to be underestimated, since their powers can be used lethally in many ways. 20. Hulk This category also includes Abomination and Thanos without his sword and his armor. Extremely strong beings (Thanos more than the other two), incredibly difficult to hurt. 19. Pre-awakened Thor Thor was very powerful even before awakening his true powers, and we know from What if? that he was at about the same level of Captain Marvel, and Captain America with Mjolnir, due to the enchantment. 18. Kurse A character mostly overlooked but very dangerous. He is a dark elf empowered to extreme levels by a gem that temporarily makes him much stronger than Thor, and even able to deflect Mjolnir. 17. Vision He‚Äôs made of very durable Vibranium, can make himself intangible or extremely dense, control electronic systems, and even influence people's minds and project a beam of energy with the infinity stone. Thanks to his intangibility, he can negate physical attacks of those below him and kill them without too much effort, while he‚Äôs almost defenseless against magic users. 16. Old Loki The older and more powerful version of Loki is able to master spells worthy of a master of the mystic arts and create illusions the size of Asgard. He briefly confronted Alioth, who can consume spacetime itself. 15. Awakened Thor He endured the heat of a neutron star, fought Hela and Thanos, won against Hulk, and he‚Äôs strong enough to move the rings of a Dyson sphere. With Stormbreaker he can also control the Bifrost, which can potentially destroy planets. 14. Hela She can craft a multitude of weapons of various sizes out of thin air, and she‚Äôs also very durable and can regenerate wounds. She single-handedly beat Asgard's entire army and was no match for awakened Thor. On Asgard, she is only inferior to Odin. 13. Surtur Surtur with the Eternal Flame is taller than a mountain and powerful enough to destroy an entire realm and even kill Hela. 12. Alioth A beast born out of the tears of spacetime eons ago, during the multiversal war. He feeds on spacetime itself, and routinely devours entire branches of the sacred timeline. 11. Odin He was never actually seen during battle, but Odin's power at his peak was unmatched, since he was one of the few beings that could neutralize Hela and defeat Surtur with the Eternal Flame. 10. Doctor Strange He was able to face Thanos with four infinity stones and force his will on Dormammu. He masters a wide range of very powerful offensive and defensive spells. 9. The Ancient One The previous Sorcerer Supreme has many centuries of experience and practice of the mystic arts behind her, which makes her capable of warping reality almost completely. She can also force two timelines to develop in the same universe, as What If? showed us. 8. Scarlet Witch Wanda is now able to manipulate reality to the point that she can control an entire city without even realizing it, thanks to Chaos Magic. She faced Thanos with five gems, created a sentient being and an infinity stone out of thin air, and with the Darkhold, she will become more powerful than the Sorcerer Supreme, therefore superior to both the Ancient One and Doctor Strange. 7. Celestials The architects of the universe. They created planets, stars and galaxies, and can generate life (deviants) or very powerful sentient synthetic beings such as the Eternals. They can manipulate matter from the small to the very large scale. Ego also belongs here. 6. Dormammu He‚Äôs able to absorb the entire universe and incorporate it into the dark dimension, a timeless place where he is almost omnipotent. The infinity stones can be used against him, though. 5. Thanos with all six stones With all six stones he‚Äôs the most powerful being in the universe, capable of destroying the cosmos, recreating it, or killing half of all beings, with just a snap of his fingers. Almost omnipotent, since using all six stones at the same time takes a heavy toll on his body. 4. The Watcher In addition to being almost omniscient, his physiology makes him able to withstand hits from Infinity Ultron (made of Vibranium) and hit him back. He can create force fields, summon a suit of armor, emit blasts of energy that can briefly overpower the power of more than one infinity stone, and can travel anywhere in the multiverse. 3. Doctor Strange Supreme Through the absorption of demons and mystical creatures for centuries, he is at a power level close to that of an entity. He inadvertently destroyed his own universe, simply ate a galaxy level explosion, and faced Ultron with all the infinity stones. He is also the only human being who has become powerful enough to sense the presence of the Watcher. 2. Infinity Ultron Thanks to Vision‚Äôs body, Ultron can use the power of the stones without any of the limits that living beings are subject to, at levels never seen before. He exterminated the entire universe in no time, destroyed galaxies with a thought, warped reality with his fists, travelled the multiverse, and defeated the Watcher. 1. Nathaniel Richards Even though he‚Äôs just a human being, Kang is one of the most intelligent and dangerous individuals in the multiverse. He is a scientist who created technologies for time travel and a temporal organization placed outside the multiverse itself, where any power and even the infinity stones have no effect. He exterminated entire timelines, was able to tame Alioth, has perfect knowledge of every event in the sacred timeline, and lives in the Citadel at the end of time, virtually unreachable by anyone. For comparison, it took Tony Stark, Hank Pym and Bruce Banner, to primitively replicate just time travel. And all of this was technically accomplished by He Who Remains and not by Kang the conqueror, an even more dangerous variant. Just think that If He Who Remains was still alive, Doctor Strange Supreme and Infinity Ultron wouldn't even exist."},{"prompt":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor. Should I let him?","completion":"I have a daughter who just turned 4, she had a sleepover at grandmas apartment and before I left, I folded up several blanket on the floor next to grandma's bed and told her it ‚Äúwas her special little bed‚Äù and she loved it, thought it was the greatest thing in the world. Now a few months after that she still folds up extra blankets and puts them on the floor next to her bed and insists on sleeping on the flood instead of her twin bed. So I tried making her sleep in bed but it was more of a fight than it was worth, so I just let her sleep there on the floor. It's in her room, she still going to bed at bed time, and I think she'll grow out of it. My mom always said that a parent has to pick and choose your battles, and this doesnt seem like one that is worth fighting."},{"prompt":"it true that Vlad the Impaler is a national hero in Romania and, if so, why is that the case?","completion":"This answer doesn‚Äôt mean to be complete, as other people answered certain aspects of Vlad‚Äôs personality and life. It has to be mentioned that Vlad Draculea was from the Dragon‚Äôs order issued to his ancestors by some German king (or prince). In those times, end of 14th century, beginning of 15th, Ottomans were becoming more and more dangerous. Vlad‚Äôs ancestors faught fiercely to keep the Ottomans at bay, at least North of Danube (Wallachia). Vlad was actually the 3rd with that name in his family, also called Vlad III. He was cruel, but his life was also cruel, since childhood. He was raised at the Ottoman court as a child, sent there by his parents to be a guarantee that Romanians would not rebel against Turks. He learnt military strategy and all the ways of the Turks, being believed that he would become an important military commander of the Turkish army, eventually the Yanissaries (elite soldiers, raised and trained European kids, taken as tribute). He knew all the ins and outs of the Ottomans‚Äô military strategies and Turkish way of life, even their psychology. And he took advantage of it, nevertheless. It seems Vlad was the first, in recorded European history, who used CHemical and bacteorological warfare against enemies. If leppers or plagued people would die, he took t heir corpses and used them as disease spreading bombs, by being catapulted in the Turks quarters, fortresses, or even citadels. In the same manner, he used the psychological warfare. Once he caught some Turkish soldiers looking for food in the countryside, durning some punishment campain from the Turks, he would impale and expose them across the whole path he knew the Ottomans would later travel to meet him in battle. The corpses were intentionally desfigured and marked in such a way to horrify the enemy soldiers. Then, he was an extremely gifted military strategist. His army was always 4‚Äì5 times less numerous than Turkish. He used the terrain, the weather, the time of day, the sun position and everything else possible to get advantage. Sometimes he dressed his soldiers in Turkish clothing and was riding the Turkish camp after midnight. Such lightening attacks, created confusion and horror and there were situations when Turks killed each other in large numbers, following one of those raids. On a different front, the internal one, yes, it is true that you could leave a purse of gold, in the middle of the road, in any village of Wallachia, during his reign and it would stay there until the owner would come back and take it, no matter when that would be. Also, there are claims of many public wells to have silver and gold cups to drink from, as it is known gold and silver do not spread germs, if you wash them with water (they didn‚Äôt know about germs, but observed disease doesn‚Äôt spread with precious metals). That was possible because of his harsh punishment against thieves. Yes, Vald the Impaler is a Romanian hero, as others stated, as well and he seems to be even more wanted these days, to clean the country of corruption. I am absolutely sure he would accomplish that in record time."},{"prompt":"Do all UK people say they speak ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù and not ‚ÄúBritish English‚Äù?","completion":"It‚Äôs shorter and nobody has any reason to ask ‚ÄúDo you mean British English or American English?‚Äù If you speak one, you can be understood perfectly well by someone who speaks the other.

But it is the proximity to the Sun, and its rate of heat loss, that makes us ‚Äúwarm‚Äù. 13.8 billion years ago, at the time the medium that emitted the CMBR radiation quenched (the CMBR ‚Äúglow‚Äù was its last ‚Äúshout‚Äù), the coldest place in the Universe was about 3000 K. Quite hot, actually, the entire sky would have looked like the surface of a red giant, in every direction. As the Universe expanded, this ‚Äúcoldest temperature‚Äù cooled to 2.72 K today. Just like an expanding gas, cools, so does the Universe ‚Äúon average‚Äù. So it is ‚Äúcold‚Äù, because the Universe has and is expanding.

Well, not a LOT. I don‚Äôt usually eat out more than once a month, and most times that‚Äôs fast food. HOWEVER, when I eat at buffets, I try to arrange to go just before the changeover from lunch to dinner. Buffets charge you when you come in, so you pay lunch prices, but if you pace yourself, you get to eat the dinner items they bring out for the dinner crowd, so, technically, you save on the price. You have to still be eating an hour into your meal, though. (Most people eat faster than that,) Like I said: pace yourself. Maybe have a coffee and dessert first. Or linger over your salad. Or build something elaborate, like the build your own taco or salad and then eat your peas one at a time. Then take a bathroom break. Spend a lot of time wandering around looking at things, bring a few small items to your table, and spend a lot of time getting your exercise walking from one display to your seat and back again. Then you‚Äôre ready for the roast beef."},{"prompt":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","completion":"The Second Amendment is about political power ‚Äî which, as Chairman Mao explained, grows out of the barrel of a gun. The American Revolution and, in Europe, the Battle of Valmy demonstrated a development in military strategy that occurred at that particular stage of technological history ‚Äî the power of massed musketry, requiring little training and no more than average strength and skill. For about 100 years, a sizeable and ‚Äúwell regulated militia‚Äù was the apex of military might. Like all of the Bill of Rights, Amendment II was designed to curb the power of the new federal government. ‚ÄúThe right of the people to keep and bear arms‚Äù actually meant the right of the state governments to maintain and control their own armed forces, though not necessarily ‚Äî nor preferably, in the minds of the Anti-Federalists whom the X Amendments were designed to mollify ‚Äî in the form of standing armies. Governmental limitations on the‚Äô possession of firearms by individuals weren‚Äôt an issue because no one even thought of such a thing."},{"prompt":"Why did Talaat Pasha order the Armenian genocide? What was the Young Turk's involvement in this genocide?","completion":"Turkey says that there was no genocide. Thus, nobody can have ordered it. The issue was investigated by the Allies who had occupied the capital of the Ottoman Empire after the war. They could not find any indication for a genocide. When I was a youngster, nobody talked of a genocide. But in Turkey, people felt guilty for the events of 1915. What is undisputed is that Talat Pascha has ordered the deportation of the Armenian population from the areas where they supported the enemy. Other Armenians in other parts of Turkey did not suffer atrocities except for some in the capital because of their support for the idea to establish a state on the territory of the Empire . The ultimate goal of the Armenians was restoring the Armenian kingdom that has existed about 1000 B.C. What they never tell is that even during those years the Armenians were not the only people who inhabited that region. And at the beginning of the 20th century, the area claimed by the Armenians was populated at least by Kurds, Arabs and various smaller ethnicities. Turkey has a history of 12.000 years human civilisations. The era that can be called Turkish is not even 1000 years. If all peoples who once had something like a state in that country tried to revive their former state, we would need another 12000 years to figure out who has killed whom. Why not look forward and try to find peace?"},{"prompt":"w did algorithms predicting Hillary Clinton‚Äôs landslide victory in the 2016 Presidential Election get their prediction so wrong?","completion":"Garbage in garbage out."},{"prompt":"booking a consultation with a financial advisor worth it?","completion":"Depends on you. If you know something about the market your most trusted adviser is in the mirror. If you don‚Äôt know anything about the market put your money in SPY and learn about the market. There is no financial adviser out there that is more interested in your retirement than he is in his retirement. If you don‚Äôt want to learn about the market then I suppose that a financial advisor is the third best option. Financial advisors compare their expertise against the S&P 500. On average only 15% a year beat the S&P. It‚Äôs never the same 15%. If you buy SPY you will tie the S&P every year. The biggest thing is to keep putting money in every payday. Year in and year out. Preferably 10% or more of your paycheck. Use a discount broker like Charles Schwab. No cost trades there. All your money is working for you, not going to the broker. Advisors make the market complicated and there is no good reason for that or than to keep you confused."},{"prompt":"As an Operating Room nurse, what was the closest call for the patient you‚Äôve witnessed?","completion":"I used to work in the operating room with some great OB/Gyn doctors. They were great with the patients, very respectful of the staff. One day we got a call that we needed to get a C-Section in as soon as possible. We shuffled things around and got the patient in ASAP as requested. As I was doing the usual pre-op interview I asked why we were doing the C-Section. The woman said, quietly, something is wrong. I asked a few more questions so we would have a clue what to expect, the doctors hadn't said anything and said it wasn't an emergency. Hmmmm. The patient stated that until that morning, everything had been going great with the pregnancy, but that morning she woke up and simply felt something was very wrong. So we did the C-section. These doctors very much went by the mothers, not the I want a C-Section because I'm tired of being pregnant, but when everything was fine and then the sudden panic. The baby was delivered, no problem, but as they were examining the placenta, as is always done, they found a knot, a \\"true knot\\" in the umbilical cord. A knot like this could have lead to the death of infant during a normal birth, as had been planned. As a mother myself, I truly respected these doctors that understood and respected the gut feeling of the mother."},{"prompt":"Are antidepressants such as Zoloft and fluvoxamine dangerous? Do they damage the brain or make you crazy? Or is that just false information?","completion":"This is not false information, but it‚Äôs not the full picture. In the clinical trials for Fluoxetine/Prozac, healthy volunteers killed themselves. Forensic psychiatrist Yolanda Lucire MD has documented thousands of prisoners who murdered on an SSRI, and have a specific genetic issue with pharmaceuticals that employ a specific route through the liver. Many lives could be saved if all doctors ran the test on CYP450. Regarding the brain, after three weeks roughly, the brain‚Äôs architecture changes in order to adapt. This is why they have to be excruciatingly slowly tapered, and even then some people will never be able to get off. Forty percent of people on SSRI‚Äôs report sexual dysfunction, this is one of the reasons they have been called ‚ÄúDivorce drugs‚Äù (they also blunt emotion). Taken long term they increase early mortality. I just read you the riot act, but here‚Äôs the thing; for some people, they are life saving. People tell me that these drugs allow them to live a normal life when nothing else has helped. They know all the risks, they didn‚Äôt come to the decision lightly, and they are closely monitored by their doctor."},{"prompt":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","completion":"There are many groups but most are simply dedicated to sharing copyrighted material with its subscribers.

End of story. Removing the tool criminals use to kill people does not fix anything. This is common sense even a young child understands. How the far Left has become so inane and completely separate from common sense is beyond me. If you doubt that taking the weapons doesn't stop the crime, of if you are a silly follower of Vox news and you think taking guns will stop suicides, you need to take a hard look at the facts: Japan and Korea have a near complete ban on gun ownership, yet they have twice the per capita suicide rate as America. The UK has almost a complete ban on firearms, yet their overall crime rates has not went down, in fact it has increased by over 39%, putting it on the path to match its violent crimes rates not seen since the 90s. Any and all kinds of weapon control always have failed, and always will fail. That is a fact. Period. All of the evidence supports that claim, and annihilates the ‚Äúgun control works‚Äù claims. Want more evidence? Click the link below. In the answer within that link, you will find everything you need to forever convince you of the truth; guns prevent crime at best. At worst, they have a net zero effect ‚Äî meaning they don't increase crime. In America, private firearms SIGNIFICANTLY decrease crime, at a rate of 500,000 to 1,000,000 crimes prevented per year.

It is easy to ruin good duck by cooking it like it was chicken - the flavor profile and distribution of fat are very different and that will end up with a cut that is both too dry and too greasy. Duck cooked correctly is heavenly - tender and flavorful without overwhelming, allowing it to be used in many dishes. It can be served with minimal seasoning as is often found in European recipes (in fact, the duck fat rendered during cooking is flavorful enough to be used as a flavoring itself - duck fat French fries are amazing) or it can be highly seasoned (tea smoked duck from an authentic Chinese restaurant is one of my favorites)."},{"prompt":"w do I talk like a native English speaker?","completion":"People often come to us with the hope of being able to speak English just like a native and we never dissappoint them.

These defenses were part of the larger Atlantic Wall, an extensive system of coastal fortifications built by Nazi Germany to deter an Allied invasion. The German gunners were positioned to provide interlocking fields of fire, covering multiple angles, including the front of the landing craft as they approached the shore. The defenders' primary goal was to prevent the Allied forces from establishing a foothold on the beach and moving inland. As a result, the gunners were typically situated at elevated positions or inside fortified bunkers, which allowed them to fire down onto the beaches and into the landing craft as they approached. The front-opening ramp of the Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVP), or Higgins boat, was a crucial feature in facilitating the swift disembarkation of soldiers and vehicles onto the beach. Speed was essential during the landings, as lingering in one spot put the landing craft and their occupants at greater risk from enemy fire. The ramp design allowed soldiers to exit the boat and move inland as quickly as possible, minimizing their exposure to enemy fire. Despite the front-opening design of the Higgins boats exposing the first soldiers to greater danger, it was a necessary part of the strategy to secure the beachhead and ultimately win the battle. The soldiers who participated in the D-Day landings knew the risks involved but were determined to push forward and overcome the enemy defenses."},{"prompt":"f you and your wife were laying in bed and you both hear a noise downstairs at 3 AM, do you believe that it is your duty as a man to investigate the noise and put yourself at potential risk to protect you and your wife?

I‚Äôve had the opportunity to try out a pipe organ. They‚Äôre similar enough that a pianist can sit down at an organ and play a tune. With a bit of practice to adjust for the different feel of the keys, I think I could even play a complex piece of music without many mistakes. But it wouldn‚Äôt be organ music. It would be piano music played on an organ, and it wouldn‚Äôt sound right. And I couldn‚Äôt play actual organ music without learning the organ first. One obvious difference is the foot pedals. Organists play bass parts using a pedalboard. They also control volume using a foot pedal. The volume pedal would be easy enough for a pianist to figure out (I‚Äôve used a volume pedal with an electronic keyboard), but playing notes with the feet is something totally new that a pianist will have zero experience with. Another obvious difference is the multiple keyboards. That‚Äôs not such a big deal; I‚Äôve use a multiple-keyboard setup when playing in a rock band, and it‚Äôs not that hard to adjust to having more than one place to put your hands. But it is still an adjustment. Switching stops is also in this category. Organs don‚Äôt just have one set of pipes, they have multiple, with different sounds. A piece may call for switching stops in the middle of a piece, which is generally done with a big set of knobs. Learning all of those and how to work them quickly would take a while, though again, I‚Äôve had to switch sounds mid-song on an electronic keyboard, and it‚Äôs doable. A big thing that isn‚Äôt so obvious is differences in technique. On a piano you press the key, and you hold it if you want to keep the dampers off the string, but the sound starts decaying immediately after you hit it. On an organ the sound keeps going at full volume for as long as you keep the key depressed. That has some significant effects on technique. Organists have to be precise about when they release a key, in a way that pianists don‚Äôt. There is a standard technique in organ in which you use one finger to press a key, and then put a different finger on that key, and remove the first finger without ever releasing the key. This lets you play legato passages while moving your hand to different positions. It‚Äôs a technique that doesn‚Äôt exist in piano. There is nothing even similar for piano. It would feel unnatural to me as a pianist, and if I were going to learn organ, I would need to learn the technique and then drill it until it felt natural. Bottom line, an organist is not a pianist and vice versa. Are there transferable skills? Sure. I guarantee it‚Äôs much easier to move from piano to organ than from saxophone to organ. But it‚Äôs not like, say, switching from flute to piccolo, where it‚Äôs basically the same instrument with minor adjustments. It‚Äôs more like switching between bass guitar and guitar, or between trumpet and trombone."},{"prompt":"w do Java lambdas with calls to functional interfaces work internally?","completion":"The are compiled to an anonymous class that implements the interface and is instantiated and later executed when the lamdba is evaluated.

The first time we saw this ability in use, Nagato used all of his remaining strength after the Destruction of Konoha and his fight with Naruto to summon the King of Hell and restore life to those who had died during the attack. Nagato died after performing this technique, with a thought by Konan that seemed to indicate that Nagato would not survive due to his chakra reserves being too low to utilize it. However, the second time we saw this technique in use, Obito ‚Äì controlled by Black Zetsu ‚Äì invoked Rinne Tensei to bring Madara Uchiha back to true life. And that actually leaves Obito on the verge of death, only surviving after interference from Naruto and his almost divine powers. The problem with all this is that Obito had the Ten-Tails Beast removed from his body. And we know that Jinchuuriki die when that happens, and this is where things get even more confusing, as specifically the Ten-Tails Jinchuuriki do not die after extraction because of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, which is usually still sealed in the user. The definitive answer comes from Obito himself. He even states that, in order to bring Madara Uchiha back to life, as it turned out later, he would need to be sacrificed through the Divine Reincarnation of the Unholy Style.

Some people believe that microwaves can cause food to lose nutrients or become contaminated, while others argue that microwave cooking is a quick and convenient way to cook or reheat food, and can even be a healthier choice than some other methods of cooking. To understand the safety and health impacts of microwave cooking, it is important to first understand how a microwave oven works. Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, similar to radio waves, that are used to heat and cook food. When microwaves are absorbed by the water, fat, and sugar molecules in food, they cause the molecules to vibrate and create heat, which cooks the food. One concern about microwave cooking is that it may cause the food to lose nutrients. Some studies have found that microwave cooking can cause a small reduction in the levels of some nutrients, such as vitamin C and some B vitamins, in certain foods. However, other studies have found that microwave cooking can actually preserve the nutrient content of some foods, such as vegetables, better than other cooking methods, such as boiling or frying. Another concern about microwave cooking is that it may cause the food to become contaminated. It is true that microwaves can cause bacteria in food to grow and multiply, which can lead to food poisoning. However, this is not unique to microwave cooking ‚Äì all methods of cooking have the potential to cause food contamination if the food is not handled or cooked properly. As long as you follow safe food handling and cooking practices, such as washing your hands and cooking food to the recommended internal temperature, the risk of food poisoning from microwave cooking is no greater than the risk from any other cooking method. In fact, microwave cooking can be a quick and convenient way to cook or reheat food, and it can be a healthier choice than some other methods of cooking, such as deep-frying. When you deep-fry food, you add a lot of extra fat and calories to the food, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. In contrast, microwave cooking requires very little added fat or oil, which can make it a healthier choice. It is also important to use microwave-safe containers when cooking food in a microwave oven. Some materials, such as certain types of plastic and metal, can melt or catch fire in the microwave, which can be dangerous. Make sure to use containers that are specifically designed for use in the microwave, and follow the cooking instructions on microwaveable products to ensure that the food is cooked properly. In conclusion, there is no evidence to suggest that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While it is true that according to some studies, microwaves can cause some small reductions in the levels of certain nutrients in some foods, it is important to note that the overall nutritional value of the food is not significantly impacted. As long as you use microwave-safe containers and follow safe food handling and cooking practices, microwave cooking can be a safe and healthy way to prepare food."},{"prompt":"What is the right way to count the amount of nodes missing in a binary search tree to become a complete tree?","completion":"What is the right way to count the amount of nodes missing in a binary search tree to become a complete tree? Get out a piece of paper and draw a complete full binary tree with 15 nodes. Label them all, with 1 at the root, 2 and 3 on the next level, etc. That should give us the information we need. Look at the bottom row and imagine that there‚Äôs nothing after row 10. That would still be a complete binary tree. If we have node 10, then we need all the nodes up to 10. So all we have to do to know how many nodes are missing is to know what the highest node we have is and how many nodes we actually have. Walk the tree recursively, starting at the root, which we‚Äôll say has index 1. Keep a highestNodeFound variable that starts at 0. For every node we examine, we do two things: set highestNodeFound = max(highestNodeFound, index)add 1 to nodeCount Then recurse, calling examineNode(leftSubtree, index * 2) and examineNode(rightSubtree, index * 2 + 1). Once you‚Äôre done, the difference between these two is the number of missing nodes."},{"prompt":"Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?","completion":"Love is a reason. Lily thinks of it the right way, ‚ÄúJust because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not the person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love.‚Äù Lily, the protagonist of Colleen Hoover‚Äôs It Ends With Us. Ryle loved Lily. It showed in his altering his major life rules for her, rejecting his highest career goal and supporting hers instead‚Äî all, however, did get squandered because his aggression dominated his affection, at times. Repeating his violent actions, Ryle was apologetic‚Äî a common reason why people do not leave. They apologize, and are granted chance upon chance, hoping for a change. He was genuinely sorry for having mistreated her. He never wanted to be the reason for her affliction. He never wanted to lose her. He had promised to never repeat it the first time he ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô hit her. Ryle loved Lily. But love doesn't allow violence, with no excuse whatever. Ryle knew he was problematic. It ached him knowing he caused her aches (I almost rooted for him, ngl). He lived through his childhood trauma, and thus, struggled with PTSD. But your sufferings, in no way, excuse you to make others suffer. Lily, at last, sought refuge in Atlas, her first love. The perfect guy, who isn't commonly found outside these tales. Another reason why people don't leave. There isn't everyone's true love waiting for them. They compromise, constantly hoping that their love will paint all red flags, green. I doubt if Lily would've been bold enough to ask Ryle for divorce if Atlas hadn't returned to her life. And the last reason‚Äî their child. Children are usually the reason why parents don't separate, no matter how toxic one of them turns out. They think it to be the best to let their child live with both parents together. But since Lily was such a child, she didn't want her daughter to do the same‚Äî view her father through a negative lens. She knew that the moments of her father being cruel are bound to leave an impact on her mind. She saved Ryle from being a villain in his daughter's eyes. They shared the custody of their child, but not their lives. There exist very many reasons to stay, but if physical or mental stability is threatened, it isn't worth taking the risk.

The smartphone has a powerful 5000mAh battery which is expected to last a really long period of time and the 128GB storage is again something really good for the users.

However, here are some widely acclaimed and influential science fiction novels that have had a significant impact on the genre: 1. \\"Dune\\" by Frank Herbert: Set in a distant future, \\"Dune\\" is an epic tale of political intrigue, religion, and ecological concerns on a desert planet called Arrakis. It is highly regarded for its world-building and complex themes. 2. \\"Foundation\\" by Isaac Asimov: This classic series follows the story of Hari Seldon, a mathematician who predicts the fall of a galactic empire and establishes a plan to shorten the subsequent dark ages. It explores concepts of psychohistory, social engineering, and the rise and fall of civilizations. 3. \\"Neuromancer\\" by William Gibson: Often credited with popularizing the cyberpunk genre, \\"Neuromancer\\" takes place in a dystopian future where hackers, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality intertwine. It is known for its gritty atmosphere and groundbreaking ideas. 4. \\"1984\\" by George Orwell: While not strictly science fiction, this dystopian novel presents a chilling vision of a totalitarian society where government surveillance, thought control, and manipulation are pervasive. It remains relevant and influential decades after its publication. 5. \\"Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley: Another dystopian classic, \\"Brave New World\\" depicts a future where technology, genetic engineering, and social conditioning have created a highly stratified and controlled society. It explores themes of individuality, freedom, and the dehumanizing effects of a technocratic world. 6. \\"Snow Crash\\" by Neal Stephenson: This cyberpunk novel delves into a near-future world where virtual reality, linguistic viruses, and corporate power intertwine. It combines fast-paced action with philosophical and satirical commentary on technology and society. 7. \\"Hyperion\\" by Dan Simmons: Part of the \\"Hyperion Cantos\\" series, \\"Hyperion\\" is a blend of science fiction and fantasy, following a group of pilgrims who share their personal stories while traveling to a mysterious, time-altering structure called the Time Tombs. It is known for its complex narrative and deep exploration of themes. 8. \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" by Ursula K.

The institution was far from obsolete: it remained the economic, social, and political backbone of the antebellum South, and its profitability was only increasing. The Confederacy‚Äôs willingness to go into a war in which they knew they were from the start the underdog was only proof of that - the value of slaves had gone up drastically in the last few decades, especially as the demand for raw materials went up as well. Indeed; slaves were becoming more and more profitable: And the production of cotton was on the rise as well, fueling their necessity: One thing that people who state this idea miss is that slavery only formally ended in 1865. African-Americans today overwhelmingly live in urban environments, but that‚Äôs a result of the 20th century Great Migration wherein the ascent of Northern cities led to greater migration into these environments by African-Americans from the South. But before that, blacks were overwhelmingly living in rural environments - and largely in a form of glorified serfdom. The new governments in the former Confederacy made all kinds of grotesque attempts at ensuring the former slave population remained dependent to them. One way was through sharecropping [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #gYPzc] - after the war, ex-slaveowners had land without workers and slaves had no money. They were thus driven into a system that ensured they were tied down to their lands for extremely low wages, and this system came to its final end only in the 1940s with improved agricultural techniques. There was also convict leasing, another notorious way to check the power of the black population. After the Civil War ended, laws regarding larceny or burglary were enforced also exclusively upon African-American populations. White authorities had the ability to more-or-less arrest any black person off the street (who was summarily convicted), and these convicts were then leased (read: enslaved) to any contractor hired by the state. To make this system even worse, the convicts were expected to pay off any associated costs for their imprisonment ‚Äî meaning that a conviction that might consist of a week in jail could result in several months of work. Corruption was also very prevalent: in the 1860s, for instance, the governor of Alabama leased 400 convicts for 5 ‚Äî total ‚Äî- to Smith and McMillen Co. for six years. This company was itself a subsidiary of Alabama & Chattanooga Railroad, which the said governor would become President of after his term ended. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #utwxD](African-American convicts, c. late 19th century) Anyways‚Ä¶to answer your question directly, for a long time. Obviously one can‚Äôt test this hypothesis, but there‚Äôs little reason to believe a slave-based economy would be phased out; regardless of whether the US abolishes slavery a couple of decades later, it‚Äôs easier to believe that instead of being enshrined through legal means, such a system would instead be enshrined through one of the aforementioned methods (as it did happen). Until the mechanization of agriculture of the mid-20th century, the rural South remained dependent on the de facto enslavement of blacks. There‚Äôs little reason to believe this would change without the 13th Amendment.

Just like there are two sides to a coin, Jayalalithaa‚Äôs political career too had some black marks. Not only her political career was tarnished, but also her personal image. She was lauded as ‚ÄòAmma‚Äô and received utmost respect from everyone in the Tamil state. She is the only political leader who brought her party into power in consecutive elections, a rare feat achieved after 30 years. The political career took a different turn after political leader Subramanian Swamy (then, the Janata Party President) filed a disproportionate assets case against her in June 1996. After an 18-year period, Jayalalithaa, Sasikala, Ilavarasi and Sudhakaran are finally convicted on 27th September 2014. Following are some shocking facts about Jayalalithaa‚Äôs wealth!

Jayalalithaa disrobed in Tamil Nadu Assembly The incident took place during the Budget session in the Tamil Nadu State Assembly. The DMK was in power. The ruling party leader, Karunanidhi, then the Chief Minister and Finance Minister of the state stood up to deliver about the State‚Äôs Financial Budget for FY 1989 ‚Äì FY 1990. Karunanidhi‚Äôs speech was interrupted by Congress MLA Kumari Anandan. She alleged that the CM, Karunanidhi used state police to harass Jayalalithaa, the leader of Opposition. Soon, Jayalalithaa joined the protest and claimed that her phones are being tapped under the instructions of the CM. Within minutes, what started as Assembly Budget Sessions soon turned out to be a chaotic situation. In amidst of the chaos, Jayalalithaa screamed, ‚Äòpeople charged with criminals should not be allowed to introduce the budget‚Äô. She out-rightly affirmed that Chief Minister Karunanidhi was corrupt, and he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be even on the Assembly premises. She further stated ‚Äòthe CM should resign‚Äô.Karunanidhi snapped at Jayalalithaa and AIDMK stating, ‚Äòthese comments need to be removed from records for being unparliamentary‚Äô. This made Jayalalithaa very angry. On receiving Jayalalithaa‚Äôs command to attack Karunanidhi, the AIDMK MLA KA. Sengottiyan rushed towards the desk of Karunanidhi. In this riot, Karunanidhi lost his balance and fell. The riot began with DMK members dismantling the microphones and throwing them at the AIDMK members. Soon, the DMK was answered with slippers and books. One of Jayalalithaa‚Äôs (AIDMK) MLA even tore the budget papers in half. Realizing that things are being blown out of proportion, the speaker adjourned the house. Everyone expected the proceedings to continue in a much-civilized manner after the riot. But things just got worse. While Jayalalithaa was coming out of the Assembly, Durai Murugan of DMK, then minister of Public Works obstructed her, grabbing at her sari. Jayalalithaa cried for assistance. Shockingly, Karunanidhi neither dismissed Durai Murugan for his digesting act or tendered an apology in the house (Tamil Nadu State Assembly) to Jayalalithaa. Jayalalithaa publicly vowed that she would never step into the house (assembly) until conditions are created for a woman to attend the Assembly sessions with dignity and decorum. The CM Karunanidhi and Durai Murugan along with other DMK leaders were condemned and termed as uncouth and rowdies. Death of Jayalalithaa‚Ä¶ Rumours and Doctor‚Äôs Version Rumours Not only her life, but the death of Jayalalithaa also became controversial. Though Doctor Richard Beale, an Intensivist Specialist, London Bridge Hospital clarified on the reports of the death of Jayalalithaa, many rumours made headlines. Senior AIDML leader, PH Pandian claimed that Jayalalithaa was pushed by someone [Sasikala]. ‚ÄòDuring the night that she was hospitalized, Amma [Jayalalithaa] had a heated argument with people in Poes Garden. Amma was greatly depressed and was later pushed down by someone. There was no sign of remorse on the face of Sasikala when I saw her in the hospital corridor along with her battalion of relatives.‚Äô Jeemon Jacob, who reported for Tehelka stated in 2012 that, ‚ÄòAfter Amma came to know that the nurse appointed by Sasikala is giving her slow-poison and other chemicals, she expelled Sasikala and her relatives out of the Poes Garden. An email written by journalist Bharka Dutta claimed that Jayalalithaa was given the wrong medicine for Diabetes before she was admitted. Doctor‚Äôs Version Doctor Richard Beale who was a part of the team of doctors who treated Jayalalithaa, gave a conclusive breakdown of the timelines right from Jayalalithaa‚Äôs admission into the hospital, and until her death. Jayalalithaa was put on a non-invasive ventilation. It was necessary for her to go on a ventilator. Though her initial condition improved, the sepsis disease progressed internally.After a doctor read the Election Commission letter, she signed the letter while being in conscious stated regarding who will be the Chief Minister of the state.She was brought to the hospital after she complained about short of breath. She was severely affected by sepsis disease. Even the severe respiratory infection was due to a blood infection, caused by sepsis. It led to the organ failure slowly with time.After sepsis overtook her health, she was limited to sign movement. Most of the time she was sleeping. She was interacting, eating and talking to over a week after sepsis got worse.Diabetes not only made the infection worse but also made the treatment of the disease difficult.During her last days, we only allowed people whom Jayalalithaa wanted to meet. Though she used to understand, she was not able to speak during her last days.There was no amputation or transplant done to Jayalalithaa. The marks shown on her cheeks are common in many critically ill patients.She suffered a severe cardiac arrest at around 17:00 hours on 5th December 2016. It was a WCA (Witnessed Cardiac Arrest) after a medical professional was present at the time of the cardiac arrested. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) was performed for 5 minutes, and ECMO ‚Äì Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation treatment was given to her. We waited for 24 hours.Though the discussion about the transfer of Jayalalithaa cropped up during the last few days, we felt that it would be difficult to transfer such a critically ill patient. Jayalalithaa also conveyed to us [when she was awake] that she did not want to be shifted to London.After being admitted to the hospital, she suffered a sudden and severe cardiac arrest during the progress of the treatment. The sudden cardiac arrest was responsible for the death of Jayalalithaa. The arrival of Selfish Scavengers after Jayalalithaa‚Äôs death! Though the scavengers in the wild help the nature by clearing the dead remains, the scavengers in the civilized society end up feeding on dead people‚Äôs property and assets to amass wealth by cheap means. Niece and Nephew ‚Äì Deepa and Deepak Jayakumar It all started after Jayalalithaa‚Äôs niece and nephew, Deepa and Deepak Jayakumar claimed themselves as the legal heirs of the late TN CM. Talking to the press, a week after the death of Jayalalithaa, Deepak Jayakumar said, ‚ÄòJayalalithaa has left her properties and wealth to me and my sister Deepa. The Veda Nilayam in Poes Garden, Chennai belongs to us [him and his sister]. This is clearly written in Jayalalithaa‚Äôs will.‚Äô Things further turned to be murkier, after son‚Äôs and daughter‚Äôs started coming from various parts of Tamil Nadu. Shoban Babu ‚Äì Jayalalithaa Fake Son episode A 28-year-old man named, Krishnamurthy, a resident of Erode, Tamil Nadu claimed that he is the only son of the Late TN CM and is the legal heir of her property. He further stated that he is living with his adopted parents in Jayalalithaa‚Äôs friend Vanithamani‚Äôs house. Krishnamurthy filed a petition in the Tamil Nadu high court stating that he is born to Jayalalithaa and Telugu actor Shoban Babu. The man was later arrested after the police found that documents he submitted to the court were fake. The police officials have identified the man‚Äôs biological parents and the court dismissed the case. MGR‚Äì Jayalalithaa Fake Daughter episode Another woman, identified as Priya Lakshmi, claimed that she was the daughter of MGR and Jayalalithaa. During their investigation, the police later found out her claims to be a hoax. She has been arrested on the charges of ‚Äòfraudulence.‚Äô Apart from these, a 37-year-old woman named Amrutha Sarathy from Bengaluru claimed to be the daughter of the late CM. ‚ÄòI am ready to even undergo DNA test. I thought Shylaja and Sarathy were my parents. It was only recently my father (who brought me up), Sarathy told me about my true birth while he was on his deathbed. He told me that I was the daughter of Shoban Babu and Jayalalithaa.‚Äô Shoban Babu ‚Äì Jayalalithaa ‚Äòalleged‚Äô Daughter episode Above all these, the Mannargudi mafia, headed by Sasikala, and accompanied by her husband Natarajan, and her clan of relatives had a supreme influence on the late Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa. Since the latter‚Äôs death, the Mannargudi mafia has been trying desperately to acquire the vast properties that belonged to Jayalalithaa. Currently, Sasikala, along with 2 others is serving a 4-year-jail-term."},{"prompt":"What do I do when a USPS package says ‚ÄúAttempted Delivery item being held, addressee being notified‚Äù but no slip has been left?","completion":"You'd better contact the local USPS to verify the package delivery status and pick up the parcel in time to avoid shipping return."},{"prompt":"w did minerals support Alfred Wegener‚Äôs theory?","completion":"(Continental drift was hypothesized by Wegener in 1912).

Gross, gross‚Ä¶.and more gross."},{"prompt":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","completion":"The simplest answer: Because Kannadigas are the most accommodating and adjustable people in the South. I am not a Kannadiga, but I have lived here for the past 8 years and I would like to share my views here. I've lived not just in Bangalore, but in a few other cities too. I have travelled from Mysuru to Hubbali, from Chickmagalur to Karawar, from Belgaum to Hospet and believe me when I say, Kannadigas are probably the most accommodating people you will ever meet. The Bangalore - Mysuru belt is known for the immigrants, tourists, and backpackers. The locals here are really proud of who they are and would love to share what they have with you - rich culture, traditions, festivals, everything! They don't want anything in return. No need for any media limelight, no need for any viral youtube videos, and there's no need for publicity. Nope, they're good! Go towards Hubbali-Dharward, and you'll feel you're in North India! It's the trading hub of the state and you will find Marwaris, Gujaratis, Marathis, and several other North Indians here. They're the capital of Hindustani classical music and literally every family belongs to some gharana or the other. If you love classical music and some fantastic sweets, just befriend a local because, again, they keep most of this to themselves and you wouldn't know where to look. Coastal Karnataka - Mangaluru, Udupi, Karwar, well, you'll find the most polite Kannadigas here. The dialect they speak here is pure poetry! This is where I learnt all my Kannada! Enjoy the beautiful beaches, the coastal cuisine, take as many pictures as you want, and stay as long as you want. How many non Kanndigas have heard of Bengre Beach, Kaup Beach, or Koodlu Falls? Very few, I'm sure! This is because none of these are openly publicized. Doesn't mean you aren't welcome! You most certainly are! Kannadigas love staying away form the limelight. In fact, they hate the spotlight. Besides, they have always valued education very strongly and this has helped them connect with people from different parts of the country very easily. Allow me to illustrate: I was at a small village called Parkala, about 5 kms from Udupi for a taste of authentic Udupi cuisine. Someone had told us that there was this food joint, a rather shabby and worn down place, run by a very senior elderly couple, Ajja and Ajji, that served the best vegetarian meal we'd ever had. We wanted to give it a shot. The couple who welcomed us in would have been easily in their late 70s or early 80s. Frail, wrinkled, and slightly hunched. But they welcomed us warmly. The place was a part of their own home that they had transformed into a little cafe that served lunch. We all took our place and feasted ourselves to truly the best meal I had ever had. The payasa (rice pudding, I think it's called in English!) at the end blew my mind so hard that I wanted another helping. I looked at my friend and told him that I wanted another helping of payasa. I wasn't too fluent in Kannada back then and I asked him to help me out. So, he called Ajji, the lady, and asked her for the same. She walked towards me, looked at my empty plate, and said: \\"I'll get you a big glass!\\" in the most fluent English. I just gaped at her! Almost everyone in Karnataka speaks English or Hindi - no matter how broken it is! Bangalore would NOT have evolved into what it is today if it was not for the accommodating nature of the locals. It would not have transformed into what it is today had the Kannadigas not rolled with the changes. No matter where you are from, people will try to communicate with you in English, Hindi or even sign language! Yes, there are instances of \\"North Indian Bashing\\" and \\"Bloody Hindiwalah\\" stuff in some places. But most of that is primarily due to some bad experience they have had with someone or the other. Otherwise, they're really peaceful people who'd rather mind their own business than poke their nose into yours. I love Karnataka. The state has been my home for the past 8 years and has contributed significantly into transforming me into who I am today. I have always felt welcome wherever I travelled within the state. As I began to learn Kannada, people would actually appreciate my attempt at speaking the language and that would land with with some additional benefits like a 90 at the price of a 60 at my local bar, fresher fish, cheaper internet installation, getting away without wearing a helmet on a few occasions, etc. When people are nice, I doubt it gives much scope for gossip or bad press. So there you go!

Of course we know social security is for your retirement. If the Republicans want to cut spending it can start with the wasteful spending on wars and defense.

One such example is when Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, invested 5 billion in Goldman Sachs in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis. At the time, many investors were fleeing the financial sector, and Goldman Sachs was facing significant challenges. Buffett recognized that Goldman Sachs was a well-run company that would likely survive the crisis and emerge stronger. He negotiated favorable terms for the investment, including a 10% dividend and the option to buy 5 billion worth of Goldman Sachs stock at a discounted price. The investment not only provided Goldman Sachs with much-needed capital, but it also generated significant returns for Berkshire Hathaway. The investment turned out to be a shrewd move, as Goldman Sachs' stock price rebounded, and Berkshire Hathaway ultimately realized a profit of more than 3 billion. Another example of a shrewd business maneuver is the way that Apple has successfully transitioned from a computer company to a consumer electronics company. In the early 2000s, Apple was struggling and was losing market share in the computer industry. However, under the leadership of Steve Jobs, Apple recognized the potential of the emerging market for consumer electronics and began developing innovative products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Apple's focus on design, usability, and innovation helped it to create a loyal customer base and establish itself as a leader in the consumer electronics market. Overall, these examples demonstrate the importance of shrewd and smart business maneuvers in achieving success in the business world. Successful business leaders are often able to identify opportunities where others see only challenges and are willing to take calculated risks to achieve their goals."},{"prompt":"w can you stop a car if someone cuts the brakes?","completion":"Modern cars have dual circuit brake if the brake lines to the front were to cut you still would have brakes on the rear at a very reduced efficient operation the same if the rear lines were cut.

I work at AWS and the salary is on the upper side of industry average but the standard signing bonuses basically push it up by 1/3. As far as I know it's the only one to offer such large signing bonuses. So that is not second tier. In terms of tech, as others have said , how can aws be second tier when it's the market leader? On the other hand amazon is a company which was created by ruthlessly exploiting states inability to collect tax from online purchases and heartlessly put your favorite brick and mortar bookstores out of business, basically at a loss. They don't give back anything to open source although they suck all the value they can from it. Their whole thing is about exploiting new technology at huge enough scale so that it skews them an unfair advantage in the market. A technologically powered psychotic black hole warehouse of disruption. It's not a lot of fun working for these people. It's completely top down and as an engineer you are on the bottom and I have experienced being blamed and yelled at for pretty much everything ‚Ä¶ only about 10% of which did I have any control over. This complete demeaning disregard for the actual engineers writing their code and the amazing amount of churn as a result will likely be their ultimate downfall. In my opinion yes, this makes it a second tier tech company. Microsoft on the other hand seems to have woken up. They seem to be fighting for engineers. They have a legacy of creating significant technology, not just stealing it from open source. But now they seem to also be embracing open source. They have created languages, oses, etc. They seem to be back on track and I wonder what they can grab of the cloud."},{"prompt":"w much will liposuction cost in India?","completion":"Liposuction is the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery procedure all over the world.

And what rights are those? The ‚Äúright‚Äù not to register for the draft? Feminists have been arguing for years that if men are drafted women should be too. The idea was repeatedly shot down by conservative, male politicians, because they knew that signing up to ‚Äúsend our daughters to war‚Äù would show people what a stupid idea the draft actually was, and get them booted out of office. Oh, I know! You think it‚Äôs the right to automatically be awarded child custody by the divorce court! Sorry, no. First, it is far more likely for men to skip out on child support than to request custody. And joint custody agreements are far more often worked out in mediation than in court. In fact, many women are now going along with State-mandated full alternating shared custody because they feel that‚Äôs the only way the father will ever do his fair share of child care. And when men do go to court and they are ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù denied custody it is by conservative male judges who assume that ‚Äúthe child is always better off with the mother.‚Äù Female judges tend to rule based on the best interests of the child. Hmm‚Ä¶ are there any others? The right to get paid more for the same work? Um, no, that‚Äôs men. The right to have children without paying a penalty for it in their career? Nope, men again. The right to walk unmolested to their cars at night without threading their keys between their knuckles as a weapon against assault? Nope, men again.

The whole movie is based on that one incident which happened that night of the rock show and they didn't show that scene anywhere in the movie. After the movie ended, while the credits were rolling, they showed what actually happened that night. And the best part is, the scene is of the form of continuous video like any normal scene until Falak leaves the room. And after that, it becomes a series of still frames with an extremely tiny pause in between each frame. That gives the effect of a broken and delayed film scene which is just brilliant. The attempt of molestation on Meenal is shown in broken still frames playing one after the other but not as a continuous video. It gives a very specific kind of effect on the audience where we start getting uncomfortable and slightly irritated because of that discontinuity in the playing of the scene which compounds with the actions of Rajveer Singh on Meenal.

He rather learnt every bit of Hinduism and critiqued for the betterment of society. There is another stance where whole of his followers were beaten up black and blue (by Hindus) and he himself was attacked too, as an attempt to enter the provinces of temple to reincarnate equality amongst society. He leading a decision through hate would have made a huge clash, but he rather took it as a challange and fought over it intellectually. His hatred is not for the Hinduism as a whole, he denies the caste system and inequality among the gender.

But of course these men could still comment on my posts. I had written one or two answers explaining why I didn't want to receive PM‚Äôs from strange men, why I didn't want men hitting on me on Quora, etc. After PM access was limited, these men‚Äîmany of whom were angry that they could no longer privately harass women on Quora, responded angrily in general, and by arguing with my answers. It didn't matter that Quora moderation said it was unacceptable behavior. It didn't matter that I had made it expressly clear, on numerous occasions, that I wanted to be left alone. These men argued with me: first of all, they argued with my right to limit their access to me (even though its was already a done deal), but they also argued with me by saying, ‚ÄúYou're just saying that, but you actually really like the attention‚Äù (couldn't be more wrong), ‚ÄúHow do you know I'm not the guy who would change your mind?‚Äù (because this behavior is thoroughly repugnant to me), ‚ÄúYou wouldn't post your picture if you didn't want to be hit on‚Äù (Uh, weird assumption), and, even better, ‚ÄúYou're really just bragging about all the men who want to talk to you‚Äù (what kind of crazy person brags about harassment?)

The client connects to the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the server. Once the server responds, the proxy server sends the response back to the client. When a user requests a resource from the server, the request is sent to the proxy server first. The proxy server examines the request and, if it is allowed to fulfill the request, it will forward the request to the server. The server then sends the response back to the proxy, which sends it back to the user. This added step of the request passing through the proxy allows the proxy to apply different policies or procedures to the request, such as caching frequently-requested content or blocking access to certain websites. It also allows the proxy to hide the identity of the client by replacing the client's IP address with its own, which is called IP Masking."},{"prompt":"What exercise can lose face fat?","completion":"How to get rid of face fat: tips, exercises and diet Are you worried about chubby cheeks or a double chin? Want to slim down your face and add confidence to your look? You're not alone. Many people struggle with excess facial oil, which can be caused by genetics, aging, poor diet, lack of exercise, or hormonal changes. The good news is that facial fat can be reduced with the right combination of lifestyle changes, exercise and diet. In this article, we will show you how to make your face slimmer and more defined. 1. The scientific understanding of face oil Before we get into practical tips, let's look at the main causes of facial oil. Our face is made up of several layers of tissue: skin, muscle and fat. The amount of fat on the face depends on the percentage and distribution of total body fat, as well as genetics. Some people tend to accumulate fat on the face, jaw and neck. As we age, our skin and muscles lose elasticity, which can lead to sagging and swelling. 2. Increase physical activity One of the most effective ways to lose face fat is to exercise more. Cardiovascular exercise, such as running, cycling or swimming, can help burn calories and increase your metabolism. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five times a week. You can also add strength exercises that target facial muscles, such as facial yoga or resistance training with a facial exercise ball. 3. diet control Diet plays an important role in reducing facial fat. Focus on a balanced, healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat foods that can cause inflammation and swelling. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and flush toxins from your body. You can also eat certain foods that have anti-inflammatory or diuretic properties, such as green tea, ginger, garlic, and berries. 4. they have good posture Did you know that your posture affects the shape of your face? A drooping or drooping double chin can give the impression of being plump or bloated. On the other hand, sitting upright and pulling your shoulders back will elongate your neck and define your jawline. Whether you're sitting at your desk, driving or waiting in line, maintain good posture throughout the day. 5. Get enough sleep Sleep is important for your overall health and well-being, and it affects your skin too. Lack of sleep can cause puffiness, dark circles and sagging skin. Try to get at least 7-8 hours of quality sleep per night and try to establish a consistent sleep pattern that allows your body to rest and recharge. 6. Consider cosmetic procedures If you have persistent facial oils or loose skin that doesn't improve with lifestyle changes, you may want to consider a cosmetic procedure. Options range from non-invasive treatments such as Botox or fillers to surgical procedures such as liposuction or facelifts. However, these options come with risks and costs, so be sure to consult a qualified and experienced professional before making a decision. 7. Be patient and persistent Reducing facial fat is not an overnight process and requires patience and perseverance. Depending on your starting point and your goals, it may take weeks or months to see significant results. If you don't notice immediate changes, don't get discouraged and continue living a healthy and active lifestyle. Remember that the journey is as important as the destination and you make it for yourself. 8. Embrace your own beauty While it's important to take care of our bodies and feel good about the way we look, it's also important to embrace our unique beauty. We are all different and that makes us unique. Don't compare yourself to others or strive for unrealistic beauty standards. Instead, focus on your strengths, talents, and qualities that make you who you are. Remember that beauty comes from within and shines through our confidence and positivity. 9. Surround yourself with supportive people. Achieving your goals is easier when you have a supportive and encouraging environment. Surround yourself with people who uplift you, motivate you and inspire you to be your best self. Avoid negative or critical people who bring you down or undermine your efforts. Share your journey with loved ones and celebrate your achievements together. 10. motivation and inspiration You need motivation and inspiration to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. Find ways to stay motivated by tracking your progress, setting specific goals, or rewarding achievements. Also, find inspiration from others who have achieved similar goals or overcome challenges. You can read a success story, watch a motivational video, or join an online community that shares your interests and values. summary Reducing facial fat is a gradual and holistic process that requires changes in lifestyle, exercise and diet. By following these tips, you can achieve a smoother, clearer complexion while improving your overall health and well-being. Remember to be patient, persistent, kind and embrace your own unique beauty. Your face reflects your inner self, so let it shine with confidence and positivity. Frequent questions 1. Can facial exercises really help reduce facial oil? Facial exercises help to strengthen and tone the facial muscles, but they are not a substitute for proper nutrition and regular exercise. Use it as a supplement, not a great solution. 2. Is there a special diet to lose face fat? While there is no specific diet that targets only facial fat, a well-balanced, healthy diet can help with weight loss and reduce inflammation, which can contribute to a smoother complexion. 3. How long does it take to see reduction in face oil? It depends on many factors such as starting point, goals and lifestyle. It may take weeks or months to see visible results, so be patient and persistent. 4. Are cosmetic procedures safe to reduce facial fat? Cosmetic procedures involve risks and costs and should only be considered after consultation with a qualified and experienced practitioner. 5. Can emotional stress cause facial oils? Emotional stress can cause a variety of physical and mental health problems, including weight gain and inflammation affecting facial fat. Reduce stress and improve your overall health by using stress management techniques such as meditation, yoga or therapy."},{"prompt":"ve you left California and if so, why?","completion":"I‚Äôm from SF Bay Area in Northern California and I haven‚Äôt left California.

Three common mistakes I see in inexperienced runners are: 1) being impatient; 2) over-relying on shoes; and 3) ignoring the biomechanics of running. Some of this answer may be controversial, but as a lifelong runner, injury-free for the last 15 years, a regular running coach, and having lots of personal exposure to world-class runners, I can tell you that these mistakes are where I see people going wrong. Let's explain each of those mistakes and explore the interplay between them: Patience: Long-term runners avoid injury by developing a hardened musculoskeletal system, including denser bones, stronger tendons, and thicker ligaments. Compared to muscles, those structures and other connective tissues take a long time to toughen up because - although they are living tissue - they receive much less blood flow and, therefore, slower delivery of nutrients. As a result, they change slowly. It can take months of careful, patient training to toughen up your legs, hips, knees, back, and feet. The reason this takes so much patience is that your muscles and lungs will feel like you should run more and faster before your legs are structurally ready for it. The risk is that if you start to outrun the fitness of your tendons and connective tissues, you‚Äôre likely to get injured. Biomechanics: Our feet and legs are made for running. They‚Äôre very good at handling the demands of running once they‚Äôve been patiently conditioned to the task. However, nobody can reasonably expect their feet and legs to handle running unnaturally, or running in a way that unnecessarily increases impact and stress. Shoes: Unfortunately, modern running shoes come with promises they can‚Äôt keep, and worse, they make pretty much any level of impact feel ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù. As a result, new runners put on a pricey pair of trainers and then take off bounding and pounding on hard surfaces, repeating the same mistakes tens of thousands of times, and getting hurt. Shoes make it easy to ignore the biomechanics of running. Ignoring physics will cost you as you increase mileage. Consider the following all-too-common scenario: You and a friend get motivated start running a little more regularly and you both sign up for a 5K. It‚Äôs been years (or forever) since you‚Äôve run regularly, but you‚Äôre full of enthusiasm. You start training almost every day. You‚Äôre a little sore, but you‚Äôre getting stronger. You push through the discomfort because you‚Äôre starting to enjoy your runs and you also want to beat your friend in the 5K in a few weeks. Suddenly, your knee is bothering you and aching after every run. Or your shins hurt. Or both. So you go to your general physician and he/she says something along the lines of running being hard on your joints and maybe you have a ‚Äúbad knee‚Äù, whatever that means. He/She suggests you rest and invest in ‚Äúbetter shoes‚Äù, whatever that means. So you go to the shoe store, maybe they even put you on a treadmill, and the sales expert demonstrates how a pair of 125 trainers can ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù your foot motion, cushion your pounding strides, and somehow eliminate the stress in your legs. You buy the shoes, take a week off training and your next couple weeks of running are quite a bit better. Problem solved, right? You do pretty well in the 5K, better than you thought, and now you‚Äôre thinking about a 10K. Better increase your training mileage. Suddenly, that knee is aching again and your shins seem to hurt a little more after every run. What‚Äôs the solution? More shoes? Different shoes? You rest for a week, switch up your shoes, and get back to your runs. Your heart and lungs feel great but soon your legs are really bothering you, including your foot now. You rest a little more, start training again‚Ä¶ same thing. You get discouraged and decide maybe you‚Äôre not cut out to run after all. Maybe your knees are bad. You start thinking maybe it‚Äôs true that running is too hard on your body. OK, I‚Äôll stop there. Maybe some or all of that sounds familiar. What went wrong? The problem is a combination of three factors: You outran the pace at which your bones/muscles/tendons could condition to the demands of running. Muscles can normally strengthen in weeks, but those other structures can take months.Factor 1 is made worse by the fact that your motion-control, high-support, high-cushion shoes actually did a lot of the structural work for your feet and legs, so they had even less of a chance to properly condition. As a result, the weakest and most distressed links started to break down every time you increased mileage.Finally, your expensive shoes with all that extra cushioning made it comfortable to run with longer strides, poor form, and a pounding gait that is too hard on your body. You can solve a lot of these problem factors with the following practices: Work your way more patiently and carefully into the activity of running. Give your feet and legs several weeks to get stronger before you start piling on the mileage. Run shorter distances and take more rest days early on. Only after weeks or months of careful conditioning, strengthening, and working on flexibility should you start to increase mileage significantly.Learn good form. We weren‚Äôt originally designed to wear shoes, so run the same way you would run if you were barefoot: short, quick, low-impact strides that land directly under your center of mass. No bounding and pounding. Good form is not only more efficient, it‚Äôs also easier on your body. If you‚Äôre not sure what good form is like for you, literally run barefoot down a sidewalk and pay attention to how much you change in order to not hurt your feet as you run. No matter what shoes you‚Äôre wearing, run like that.Work on overall flexibility and strength. You can‚Äôt run well when you‚Äôre not in mechanical balance. Do 10‚Äì30 minutes of good, diverse stretching a few times a week (not as a running warm-up‚Ä¶ intense stretching as a pre-run warm-up is not as helpful as you‚Äôve been told, and may be harmful). Take up yoga if that helps. Use a foam roller on tight and sore areas. Get deep tissue massages on your legs. Additionally, do sets of squats, lunges, and other leg strengthening exercises on a regular basis.Learn how to run in shoes that don‚Äôt do the work for you. Get a pair of more minimalist shoes (no, they don‚Äôt have to be Vibram Five-Fingers) like a racing flat and rotate them in for your short runs even at the beginning of your training. Minimalist shoes not only help your form, they also enable your feet and legs to learn how to do more of the work. Eventually, you can run almost exclusively in more minimal shoes.Be intentional to toughen your body. For example, run barefoot when you have a safe surface. Find a clean beach or a well-maintained grass athletic field and do even a 10-minute barefoot run as it will make your feet and legs to all the work. Couple it with one of the days you‚Äôre training in your minimalist shoes. Also, work on your core strength, do occasional sprints, run hills when you can, etc. You can‚Äôt be a good runner and also be soft and fragile. Once your body - including your bones, tendons, and ligaments in your legs and feet - are thoroughly conditioned to the activity of running, and assuming you‚Äôre using good form, it really doesn‚Äôt matter what shoes you wear as long as they‚Äôre comfortable and the soles are appropriate for the surface upon which you‚Äôre running. Eventually, less shoe becomes more. As you can see, the interplay between patience, form, shoes, biomechanics, and injuries is a little complex. Hopefully this answer has shed some light on the dynamics and helps you avoid common mistakes. Run long, run happy and run injury-free!"},{"prompt":"What are the books to study for the NEET exam to get good marks?

But then the paranoia crept in. The police, fire brigade, ambulance service and mi5 were out to kill me which was when things turned frightening. Then scary hallucinations starting out with a constant feeling of being watched by something evil, I then heard them too scaring the life out of me. After that its a bit of a blur but a few things came back over the years, I was carrying Jesus christ reborn, later I was Jesus ready to be crucified, was told I'd be walking with my arms out to my side as if being on the cross. I thought I was possessed by the devil, one time thought I was a possed cat damaging curtains trying to scramble up them. I believed that what was going on in the news was my mafia family killing off famous people. I believed I had murdered my mother by strangulation. I thought I could read minds and that others could read mine. I thought when first admitted to hospital that world war 3 had begun, the Russians and when they forced me to take a shower with 2 nurses to clean me I was screaming the place down convinced that it would be acid coming out of the shower head. At one point I believed I was dead, could smell myself rotting. I was convinced my family were imposters, that they'd really been killed off and these people before me were imposters. Every time I signed in to my outpatient appointments or for medication (prior to being hospitalised) I thought I was signing a ‚Äúhit\\" and one day I ‚Äúknew‚Äù it would be for my youngest daughter so refused to sign and instead my partner signed but until she was home after school I was terrified she was dead. I thought that the teachers were paedophiles and that during swimming lessons they line the kids up to be sold so when my daughter came home saying swimming lessons would begin I was freaking out inside. Lots happened I can't remember it all only other thing I remember was ‚Äúcoding\\" I'd spend weeks scribbling on bits of paper trying to crack some kind of code that would make me rich. And lastly fluctuating between believing we were the poorest of the poor to telling everybody I was related to the royal family and I have millions. I was locked in a psych ward for 6 months. Just remembered I thought daddy long legs had filming and listening equipment sent by the government to soy on me so would kill them. But in hospital it went a little further and I'd catch them, chew them up, spit them on the floor then squish them around to be sure they couldn't spy on me. In real life I'm terrified of daddy long legs, couldn't go near them so how I did that shows the level of unwell I was."},{"prompt":"have a theory that Gammaray bursts are really planets setting off imploded cylindrical uranium, gun type nuclear devices and gamma ray lazing. Does anyone have any comments?","completion":"You don‚Äôt have a theory. You have a bunch of words thrown together in a fashion that is reminiscent of the ‚Äútech talk‚Äù gobbledygook one hears on sci-fi television series like Star Trek. To turn that word salad into a theory, learn the relevant physics. Learn how to model your idea using the equations of mathematical physics. Make predictions as to the intensity, spectral characteristics, temporal evolution and other properties of the burst according to your idea. Compare your predictions to actual observational data from gamma ray bursts, see if there is a reasonable correlation. If the predictions from your model are sound, and if they are not contradicted by observational data, then write it all up. The model, its mathematical representation, derivations of its predictions, sources of observational data, the statistical methods used to compare your model against that data, analysis of errors and uncertainties, the whole kaboodle. Once you wrote it all up, send it to a reputable journal (not a junk journal that publishes any piece of nonsense so long as the fees are paid). Do not be deterred by rejections; argue with referees, improve your paper, send it to another (reputable) journal if necessary. See to it that it is published. Meanwhile, do not stop working: Get more data, see if you can make further comparisons between model and reality, refine the model, strengthen its predictions. Publish more papers if applicable. See what other consequences your model offers that may be verifiable through observation. Once you have done all this work (yes, hard work) then you should feel free to announce to the world, proudly, that you have a theory. And no, nobody else is going to do it for you. If you do not have the inclination to learn the hard physics, fine; not everyone can be a basketball player or concert pianist either. But don‚Äôt expect anybody else do it for you. Crazy ideas are a dime a dozen, and people who have learned the math and physics have better things to do with their time and talent.

Most answers here relate to why Siberian Huskies are a bad choice for first time owners or those not truly dedicated to keep them healthy and happy and you can find plenty of examples of why that is already answered. What that doesn‚Äôt answer is just why so many people make the choice to adopt them in the first place. Because that‚Äôs actually a very important part of the problem. What does Harry Potter, Finding Nemo, Men in Black, 101 Dalmations and Game of Thrones have in common? They were each popular and each first led to an increase in adoption.. and then to an increase in abandonment. After Harry Potter there were an increase of hundreds of owls afterwards (when the reality of having one hit the owner). With Finding Nemo.. they had to start breeding the fish in captivity to avoid the fish dying out in the wild (.. and many kids ‚Äòfreed‚Äô them by flushing them down the loo). And 101 Dalmatians.. 25% increase in abandonment after about 6 months (when the dogs were no longer puppies)‚Ä¶ and around that after the next movie. (While they can be a family dog.. they do have a high activity level and are easy to train.. both of which are bad news if the family expected a couch potato they‚Äôd not have to walk long distances with). Men in Black.. pugs and so on. With Huskies.. The popularity of the Game of Thrones ensured that a lot of people wanted one.. and many failed to consider the reality of owning a dog.. never mind owning a working breed (I think I read that there was a 700% increase). Because while some may struggle to take on the responsibility of a normal dog.. (walking them regularly and picking up after them, vet care, food and water, training+).. choosing a working breed ups the ante by a lot. I‚Äôd expect a working type dog to be intelligent, easy to train, higher levels of energy, have inborn instincts for the type of job they‚Äôre meant to do, might be adjusted to suit the climate and job they‚Äôre meant for and more. Essentially huskies are among the dog breeds that if handled wrong have a lot of potential to find alternate ways to find an outlet for their needs. To sum it up; the main reason huskies (and other pets) are abandoned in large numbers (I‚Äôm not including Corona virus type abandonment here (expected or going on ‚Ä¶) because that‚Äôs something else) is because thoughtless people decide they want one due to a tv series or moves (likely popular) and that fail to do any research on the needs of the pets before getting one. .. And then find plenty of breeders+ willing to sell them without ensuring the puppy or dog will actually get a good home and people that can care for it properly. And when the pet then becomes more than they‚Äôre able or willing to handle.. they abandoned said pet.

About 15 years ago, my former wife of 26¬Ω years, filed for divorce. We had seven (7) children: five (5) daughters and two (2) sons. Our youngest at the time, our second son, was five years old. At the time, I prepared a counterclaim to the Petition for Dissolution her attorney filed in Domestic Relations (DR) court. I met one afternoon with the head of the Maricopa County Superior Court, Marriage License Bureau, in downtown Phoenix. The marriage license bureau was headed by a young woman of about age 25. I asked her to explain to me the general and statutory implications of the marriage license. She was very cooperative, and called in an Assistant, a tall Black man who at the time was working on an Operations Manual for internal departmental use. She deferred for most technical explanations to her Assistant. He walked through the technicalities of the marriage license as it operates in Arizona. He mentioned that marriage licensing is pretty much the same in the other states -- but there are differences. One significant difference he mentioned was that Arizona is one of eight western states that are Community Property states. The other states are Common Law states, including Utah, with the exception of Louisiana which is a Napoleonic Code state. He then explained some of the technicalities of the marriage license. He said, first of all, the marriage license is Secular Contract between the parties and the State. The State is the principal party in that Secular Contract. The husband and wife are secondary or inferior parties. The Secular Contract is a three-way contract between the State, as Principal, and the husband and wife as the other two legs of the Contract. He said, in the traditional sense a marriage is a covenant between the husband and wife and God. But in the Secular Contract with the state, reference to God is a dotted line, and NOT officially considered included in the Secular Contract at all. He said, if the husband and wife wish to include God as a party in their marriage, that is a \\"dotted line\\" they will have to add in their own minds. The state's marriage license is \\"strictly secular,\\" he said. He said further, that what he meant by the relationship to God being a \\"dotted line\\" meant that the State regards any mention of God as irrelevant, even meaningless. In his description of the marriage license contract, the related one other \\"dotted line.\\" He said in the traditional religious context, marriage was a covenant between the husband and wife and God with husband and wife joined as one. This is not the case in the secular realm of the state's marriage license contract. The State is the Principal or dominant party. The husband and wife are merely contractually \\"joined\\" as business partners, not in any religious union. They may even be considered, he said, connected to each other by another \\"dotted line.\\" The picture he was trying to \\"paint\\" was that of a triangle with the State at the top and a solid line extending from the apex, the State, down the left side to the husband, and a separate solid line extending down the right side to the wife, a \\"dotted line\\" merely showing that they consider themselves to have entered into a religious union of some sort that is irrelevant to the State. Marriage License Secular Contract Diagram STATE (primary party) HUSBAND WIFE . (secondary party) (secondary party) . GOD He further mentioned that this \\"religious overtone\\" is recognized by the State by requiring that the marriage must be solemnized either by a state official or by a minister of religion that has been \\"deputized\\" by the State to perform the marriage ceremony and make a return of the signed and executed marriage license to the State. Again, he emphasized that marriage is a strictly secular relationship so far as the State is concerned and because it is looked upon as a \\"privileged business enterprise\\" various tax advantages and other political privileges have become attached to the marriage license contract that have nothing at all to do with marriage as a religious covenant or bond between God and a man and a woman. By way of reference, if you would like to read a legal treatise on marriage, one of the best is \\"Principles of Community Property,\\" by William Defuniak. At the outset, he explains that Community Property law descends from Roman Civil Law through the Spanish Codes, 600 A.D., written by the Spanish juris consults. In the civil law, the marriage is considered to be a for-profit venture or profit-making venture (even though it may never actually produce a profit in operation) and as the wife goes out to the local market to purchase food stuffs and other supplies for the marriage household, she is replenishing the stocks of the business. To restate: In the civil law, the marriage is considered to be a business venture, that is, a for-profit business venture. Moreover, as children come into the marriage household, the business venture is considered to have \\"borne fruit.\\" Now, back to the explanation by the Maricopa County Superior Court, Marriage Bureau's administrative Assistant. He went on to explain that every contract must have consideration. The State offers consideration in the form of the actual license itself - the piece of paper, the Certificate of Marriage.. The other part of consideration by the State is \\"the privilege to be regulated by statute.\\" He added that this privilege to be regulated by statute includes all related statutes, and all court cases as they are ruled on by the courts, and all statutes and regulations into the future in the years following the commencement of the marriage. He said in a way the marriage license contract is a dynamic or flexible, ever-changing contract as time goes along - even though the husband and wife didn't realize that. My thought on this is can it really be considered a true contract as one becomes aware of the failure by the State to make full disclosure of the terms and conditions. A contract must be entered into knowingly, intelligently, intentionally, and with fully informed consent. Otherwise, technically there is no contract. Another way to look as the marriage license contract with the State is as a contract of adhesion, a contract between two disparate, unequal parties. Again, a flawed \\"contract.\\" Such a contract with the State is said to be a \\"specific performance\\" contract as to the privileges, duties and responsibilities that attach. Consideration on the part of the husband and wife is the actual fee paid and the implied agreement to be subject to the state's statutes, rules, and regulations and all court cases ruled on related to marriage law, family law, children, and property. He emphasized that this contractual consideration by the bride and groom places them in a definite and defined-by-law position inferior and subject to the State. He commented that very few people realize this. He also said that it is very important to understand that children born to the marriage are considered by law as \\"the contract bearing fruit\\" - meaning the children primarily belong to the State, even though the law never comes out and says so in so many words. In this regard, children born to the contract regarded as \\"the contract bearing fruit,\\" he said it is vitally important for parents to understand two doctrines that became established in the United States during the 1930s. The first is the Doctrine of Parens Patriae. The second is the Doctrine of In Loco Parentis. Parens Patriae means literally \\"the parent of the country\\" or to state it more bluntly - the State is the undisclosed true parent. Along this line, a 1930s Arizona Supreme Court case states that parents have no property right in their children, and have custody of their children during good behavior at the sufferance of the State. This means that parents may raise their children and maintain custody of their children as long as they don't offend the State, but if they in some manner displease the State, the State can step in at any time and exercise its superior status and take custody and control of its children - the parents are only conditional caretakers. [Thus the Doctrine of In Loco Parentis.] He also added a few more technical details. The marriage license is an ongoing contractual relationship with the State. Technically, the marriage license is a business license allowing the husband and wife, in the name of the marriage, to enter into contracts with third parties and contract mortgages and debts. They can get car loans, home mortgages, and installment debts in the name of the marriage because it is not only a secular enterprise, but it is looked upon by the State as a privileged business enterprise as well as a for-profit business enterprise. The marriage contract acquires property through out its existence and over time, it is hoped, increases in value. Also, the marriage contract \\"bears fruit\\" by adding children. If sometime later, the marriage fails, and a \\"divorce\\" results the contract continues in existence. The \\"divorce\\" is merely a contractual dissolution or amendment of the terms and conditions of the contract. Jurisdiction of the State over the marriage, over the husband and wife, now separated, continues and continues over all aspects of the marriage, over marital property and over children brought into the marriage. That is why family law and the Domestic Relations court calls \\"divorce\\" a dissolution of the marriage because the contract continues in operation but in amended or modified form. He also pointed out that the marriage license contract is one of the strongest, most binding contractual relationships the State has on people. At the end of our hour-long meeting, I somewhat humorously asked if other people had come in and asked the questions I was asking? The Assistant replied that in the several years he had worked there, he was not aware of anyone else asking these questions. He added that he was very glad to see someone interested in the legal implications of the marriage license and the contractual relationship it creates with the State. His boss, the young woman Marriage Bureau department head stated, \\"You have to understand that people who come in here to get a marriage license are in heat. The last thing they want to know is technical, legal and statutory implications of the marriage license.\\" I hope this is helpful information to anyone interested in getting more familiar with the contractual implications of the marriage license. The marriage license as we know it didn't come into existence until after the Civil War and didn't become standard practice in all the states until after 1900, becoming firmly established by 1920. In effect, the states or governments appropriated or usurped control of marriages in secular form and in the process declared Common Law applicable to marriages \\"abrogated.\\" Please pass this information along and share it as widely as possible.

So, if the population were 400 then you would need to correct. But ‚Äúhow big does the sample need to be‚Äù is a very complicated question that will depend on What statistical test you are doing or what quantity you wish to estimateHow big the effect size isFor hypothesis testing, what rates of type I and type II error you can accept. Even for what seems like the simplest case, there are complications. Suppose you want to estimate the proportion of a population that does something (e.g. has a disease, will vote for your candidate, whatever). The ‚Äúbook‚Äù formula for standard error of a proportion is [math]S = sqrt{frac{p(1-p)}{N}}[/math] where p is the proportion you want to estimate and N is the sample size. You can use this formula to find confidence intervals for the proportion. However, they will be wrong. When p is not close to 0 or 1, the above formula isn‚Äôt too bad. But when it is close to 0 or 1, it can be way off. There are various adjustments. If you are working by hand, a simple but good adjustment, suggested by Alan Agresti, is to add 2 successes and 2 failures and then recompute the proportion. (‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù and ‚Äúfailure‚Äù will need to be made appropriate to your study). However, if you are using a computer, there are better adjustments; there are several R packages for this, and SAS has PROC POWER. And, even the notion of ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù is a little complex here. Because, as the probability gets farther from 0.5, the standard error goes down, but the standard error divided by the proportion goes up."},{"prompt":"What is the best hotel you have ever stayed at, and why?","completion":"Undoubtedly, the best hotel I have ever stayed at is MarBella Corfu Hotel!

Rats we talk about rats with the wing now talk about rodent at the size of a little puppy. my ex-girlfriend and i went to this theatre in the weekday to avoid being seen by others and we choose the last seat in the theatre, you know one where the number begins and wall. i was sitting next to her with my hand wrapping around her and i feel something on my hand. i joke about it to her that her hair is mischevious(yes lame) and when she tried to adjust her hair she felt something on her hand as well and almost screamed. it was a rat walking over the seat next to the wall. then we felt something on our feet and we just ran away from there. Dogs and cats remember, all of this is in single screen almost bankrupt theatre so it wouldn't surprise you to know that i saw a dog and a cat, not at the same time. it was dark and i was finding the right place to seat and when i seated i looked at my right side and see something. it was a dog, not the one you love to pat but one that can give you diseases. other time two cats were running around in the theatre probably for the rat and they passed by my feet and touched it, it scared the hell out of me. annoying friends so i had a friend who had never watched any Hollywood movie apart from porn. i drag him to the theatre to watch i am legend. it was a will smith movie about a post-apocalyptic world and with zombie so i was really excited about it. it was in Hindi although i always preferred to watch a hollywood movie in English but for my friend i had too. first, i have to explain to him what happens, then i have to explain to him what is a zombie and what they can do and then in one scene where will smith was fighting a zombie, some of the 3D shot was too much for my friend and he actually screamed. yes it was in 2D and yet he got so scared that he turn in to a ball in his seat and i have to get out of there. girlfriend yes, most people would feel blessed to have a girlfriend and right now i would marry a dog for any closure but they are the worst kind of people when you take them to a movie, especially when its a Hollywood movie. it was inferno, with tom hank and Irfan Khan. i just wanted to enjoy the movie. like any other movie which was inspired by dan brown books, you need to pay attention and my ex-girlfriend have no intention of letting me watch that movie, so after spending almost a thousand bucks on tickets and snacks we get out of there just before the climax. i have seen people have sex in the theatre, not like making out on second base but the real deal. i have seen people fight, fist fight. i have seen people shout and whistle on the screen at the point when its most emotional, those jerks know nothing about professor Snape. that's why i stop going to the theatre and watch movies at home."},{"prompt":"Why do Arabs (mainly in Saudi Arabia and Gulf States) prefer to sleep in the morning and do activities or work at night?","completion":"i‚Äôm from saudi arabia and i personally noticed that everyone (or most of us) sleep at night and work all day, i work at night and sleep in the morning for some unknown reason, i prefer it that way, i can focus at night time and the opposite with the day time. i don‚Äôt know about others."},{"prompt":"Why do I keep hearing voices of my family and friends in my head?","completion":"It is an auditory hallucination.

Heinlein's best Young Adult novel?","completion":"Some 50+ years ago, when I read them, both ‚ÄúThe Rolling Stones (TRS)‚Äù and ‚ÄúHave Space Suit Will Travel (‚ÄúHSWT)‚Äù were my favorites. Now, some 50 years on, I now put 1958s HSWT on top. The story revolves around a teenage boy, Kip Russell, who wants to go to the Moon, on a routine passenger rocket (sort of like getting a first class ticket to Hawaii, expensive if you are poor but a daily possibility). Money is an object not had, so when a advertising jingle contest for Skyway Soap comes along with a first place prize of a trip to the Moon, he starts to enter with dozens, perhaps hundreds of entries. His slogan is selected, but someone else submitted it first. He receives the consolation prize, a very much used industrial spacesuit. One thing leads to another, and a flying saucer lands on him, he and a kidnapped young girl names Peewee try to escape on the Moon, and then its off to Pluto for five days at 8 gees. At the end, Kip is a bit sore. Later, they are off to the Small Magellanic Cloud. Also thrown are at least two alien species, ‚Äúthe Mother Things‚Äù and the other who is called ‚Äúold worm face.‚Äù Possibly a bit of time travel for a Roman Soldier. So why do I like HSWT? RAH spends a lot of time in HSWT discussing the workings of the spacesuit, usually in the context of Kip getting it working again. He describes where the radios go, internal supplies, and how the high pressure air tanks are fitted and tested. I read somewhere it would work today using RAHs technology from the 1950s. In the time of RAH‚Äôs HSWT, we have a Moon base hotel that caters of tourists, in a time without a single computer. The aliens have them in their ships, but the Earthlings use slide rules. Kip and his father have to skimp on food for a while to afford this beauty: \\"Dad says that anyone who can't use a slide rule is a cultural illiterate and should not be allowed to vote. Mine is a beauty - a K&E 20-inch Log-log Duplex Decitrig\\" I was so taken with this it took me almost 40 years to find a 16‚Ä≥ version in a local thrift store. A beauty indeed. I can use about half of the scales. It is also just a fun novel to read. No heavy themes or societal questions. Finally, it has one of my favorite novel themes. It describes what happens to an ordinary guy who is thrust into extraordinary (and extraterrestrial) circumstances. Another novel with this theme is ‚ÄúThe Thirteenth Warrior‚Äù by Michael Crichton. Would we be so brave to go on an unplanned journey like HSWT? As a sort of update while writing this, I found out that IMDB says that HSWT in movie development. Its been that way for a few years.

A human being replaces every cell in his or her body over time, ranging from every few days for red blood cells to over 50 years for bone cells. But is my father, at 68, therefore a different person to the one he was at 18? Well, he has different experiences, memories, capabilities and some changed personality traits. But generally, we would say that he is the same person because there's continuity of both existence and substance - he has (allowing for mutations) the same DNA he had at 18. Is there an analogy in the case of Theseus's ship, or the classic broom where the brush and handle have both been replaced? I'd say it's a question of continuity of use. While Theseus was actually using the ship, it's still his ship regardless of how many parts were replaced. If you keep replacing parts after he's dead and it's in a museum, each part replaced takes you further from it being Theseus's ship. That's one reason why we rarely try to restore ancient artifacts to full working order. But suppose the ship continues in use, and another admiral takes it over (and another, and another). That, to me blurs the line a bit: there may be no parts left that Theseus actually touched, but the ship is still out there, doing the job he used it for. There's a better case for saying it's still his ship. We're happier restoring and replacing parts of an historic house - as long as it's done sensitively - because it's still got to be usable. We give things that are still active a lot more leeway. Windows 8 is still Windows, but I bet it shares comparatively little code with Windows 3.1, Windows 95 or even Windows NT.

There is a certain tranquility and serenity about the story.The story is of somebody recognising what freedom is and taking that choice. The protagonist falls in love with nature. In climax,she abandons her marriage plans and instead starts living in the mountainous countryside and also starts her own small scale business there. It has been shot traversing over six states in buses and trucks. The shooting unit used to be like a kaafila (caravans), which used to move from place to place. It was shot chronologically with linear narration. There was travelling in Highway but the route taken in the film wasn‚Äôt the regular tourist route. It has been shot in isolated areas. The actress esaays a cine matic character. Her heartbreaking naivety justifies behavioral brain-fades; she makes us believe when she suddenly opens up to her Haryanvi kidnapper and she makes us believe when she breaks down by a quiet mountain stream. Highway is the soul every filmmaker works towards; a script too raw to make as a first film, but placed at the bottom of the pile as a reminder to believe. It's difficult to do those roles where there are few lines. Under intense pressure, humans can weep, laugh, dance, scream, fall in or out of love instantaneously, and it's impossible to explain this logically where there are very few lines to deliver. The tone and geography of the story changes and feel of these states support the film at that time when it travels through that state. For instance, there is a certain horrifying quality about a vast empty desert which comes at a point in the film where the horrific quality is required to give tone to the film. When you are in lush meadows there is a sense of belonging and completion, which by the time you reach Kashmir the film already feels like that. -Imtiaz Ali"},{"prompt":"w many gun owners have actually stopped a crime from being committed by using a gun?","completion":"More by far than non gun owners."},{"prompt":"What is an Amazon egift card?","completion":"Instead of getting a physical gift card, you get an email with a code that you can enter when you are making a purchase on Amazon."},{"prompt":"f you are a medical worker, have you ever experienced a patient full out faking?","completion":"It‚Äôs part of my job!

At that time, the purpose was to speed application processing, and for all intents and purposes, that has always been the case. SHOULD ANYBODY USE THE INFORMATION BELOW, PLEASE REFERENCE Anderson, Raymond [2019] Credit Intelligence and Modelling: Many Paths Through the Forest. Rayan Risk Analytics. The first known use of scoring was for mail order, a distance-lending enterprise lacking the luxury of personal interviews. In 1934, Spiegel implemented a ‚Äòpointing‚Äô system using five demographic variables‚Äîincluding occupation, marital status, location, and race‚Äîwith points tabulated by ‚Äòlow-paid female clerks‚Äô [Raff & Scranton 2017:276-7]. It was not for credit, but for the mailing of goods with an expectation of subsequent payment. At about the same time, a Phoenix bank developed a model to assess applicants with regular incomes [Dunham 1938].F‚Ä† F‚Ä†‚ÄîAccording to Durand [1941], the published score was based on employment record (20%), income statement (25%), financial statement (10%), type of security (20%), and past payment record (25%). In 1935, the American Federal Housing Association issued its Underwriting Manual, which provided tables to assess the risk of prospective home loans. Besides property location and condition, the grids also assessed ‚ÄòAbility to repay‚Äô, ‚ÄòProspects for the future‚Äô, and ‚ÄòCharacter‚Äô, with the latter getting the highest rating. Note, that the factors still required a subjective assessment by an individual. Other models were developed, with some details published. Owen L. Coon was an executive at General Finance Corporation, which specialised in automobile loans. He did an analysis of motor vehicle repossessions and developed a ‚Äòcredit quotient‚Äô scheme for assessing loan applications, presented at a conference in 1938 [Dunham ‚Äò38]. Joseph Greenberg was a sales finance officer (employer unknown) who published a model like the Phoenix bank's in 1940, only with more detail and greater weight on applicants‚Äô occupation [Greenberg ‚Äò40]. Such practices were further adopted during World War II, as credit men were called up to serve. Before they left, they codified their rules of thumb for use by housewives employed in their stead for the war‚Äôs duration. Credit for the first-ever empirical (statistical) model is given to David Durand [1941], a researcher at the USA‚Äôs National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER), who noted the earlier expert models mentioned above [Dunham ‚Äô38 and Greenberg ‚Äò41] in his paper. He was tasked towards the Great Depression‚Äôs end with assessing judgmental approaches of the era (which were quite successful considering the low loss rates). He went further to see if actuarial practices could be used for credit decisions, by applying LDA to a set sampled from 7,000 car loans obtained from banks and finance houses. He was successful, but even he doubted that it would ever replace human judgment‚Ä¶ it remained an academic curiosity. No credit history was included (major shortcoming!), only age, gender, time at residence and employer, occupation, industry, and holding of a bank account, real estate, and/or life insurance. David Durand‚Äôs (1913-96) greater fame came from pioneering statistics‚Äô and samplings‚Äô use to explain financial markets, especially why long-term bonds yield more than short-term, in an era when computers used punch cards and sampling was a necessity. He had a BA from Cornell (34), and both Master‚Äôs and PhD from Columbia (‚Äò41), after which he served as a lieutenant in Hawaii and Guam. He joined Princeton‚Äôs Institute for Advanced Studies, and then M.I.T. in ‚Äò53 as a professor at its Sloan School of Management. Other consumer-credit research included farm mortgages.F‚Ä† F‚Ä†‚ÄîMIT News, 28 February 1996; New York Times, 1 March 1996. Another unsuccessful early adopter was E.F. Wonderlic, who became director of personnel at Household Finance Corporation (HFC) in the mid-1940s. He used his knowledge of statistics to develop its ‚ÄòThe Credit Guide Score‚Äô in ‚Äò46, which instructed analysts on the score calculation, but in ‚Äò48 bemoaned its disuse despite substantial evidence that it worked. Credit analysts did not trust it, so instead made their decisions and dutifully calculated the score afterwards. Eldon F. Wonderlic (1909-80) was a psychologist better known for the Wonderlic Intelligence test, developed in 1936. After joining HFC, he tested model modifications on employees. The test was used by the U.S. Navy for selecting pilots during the war‚Äîand has since been used by thousands of companies internationally. Today, it is best known from the American National Football League, whose players‚Äô scores are published. Thereafter, Sears used scoring in the 1950s to determine to whom it should send its catalogues. Being a mail-order house, it suffered from the same issues as Spiegel in terms of distance lending. Little is known about what was being predicted, but given the nature of their then business, it was likely to determine whether goods would be paid for or returned after delivery, and not as a credit score per se. The 1950s also saw developments in the field of operations research. Problems with logistics and resource allocation led to the development of several different methodologies, one of which was linear programming (LP). George Dantzig had come up with the interior points (or ‚Äòsimplex‚Äô) method in ‚Äò47 while working with the U.S. Air Force, but it was not able to handle the instability of wartime environments. It was, however, perfect in stable settings, and was adopted by the Rand Corporation and U.S. Bureau of Standards during the ‚Äò50s, and American oil companies in the ‚Äò60s. This became the ur-methodology of today‚Äôs best-known scorecard vendor, FICO."},{"prompt":"'t a 9th chord just the 2nd chord since there's only 7 in a scale?","completion":"The basic way to consider the construction of chords is ‚Äústacking thirds.‚Äù A triad consists of 1,3,5.

In jazz and pop usage, a ninth-chord implies the existence of the 7 in the chord as well. If a specific chord with a ninth lacks the seventh, this is usually notated as ‚Äúadd 9‚Äù or sometimes ‚Äú2‚Äù to indicate the exception to the norm, that is to say, omitting the 7.

Just sell your Kindle (kidding!). You can set a recurring reminder (ideally every week) and charge your Kindle every Sunday (or Friday, for me). Do remember not to charge it above 70%.

He is Sardar Vallbhbhai Patel. During his childhood, there were many incidents that made him earn the reputation of a strong man. Once he developed a boil in his armpit and during those days in his village, the people used to go to a man who can treat this. This man used to heat an iron rod and put in the boil area and that is how he used to treat boil. Nevertheless, in the case of Patel he was little reluctant as he was very young. But the young Patel asked him to do it fast as the rod will become cold if they delay. Then he did not wait for him to do that lashing and he did it by himself. That was when young Patel stunned everyone in the village. He was tough and he was hard working. He borrowed books from lawyers and within a time limit of two years he completed his studies. He was physically very strong from his tender gaze. According to many people he used to fast twice a month and those two days long fast that included refraining from food and water. His strong character was seen in those days by many people. His mental strength came when he was in England and he finished his studies in just a few years. When his beloved wife despised, he was handed a note and he was in the courtroom fighting a case. When Patel came back to India it was his strong will that made him what people call him iron man.

They then tried to run off without paying - 3 girls left 10 minutes earlier with the bags, as if going to smoke or something.

Chellam sir has a cameo (multiverse??). The word ‚ÄúFarzi‚Äù has several interesting interpretations - from ‚Äúartificial‚Äù to ‚Äúfabulous‚Äù to ‚Äúfiction‚Äù - the plot revolves around such themes - as flawlessly designed counterfeit or fake currency notes. One of Raj & DK‚Äôs strengths is to take a sensitive plot and create convincing characters around that plot. As an audience, you have a POV for each character - and you can understand their emotional ride. Shahid is a broken man - a typical Delhi or Mumbaiker who tries to figure out his life among people who take him for a ride. He‚Äôs not just an artist by talent but an artist by practice and profession. He fakes popular art and sells it for a few bucks to make a living. Every broken man will have a guardian who guides him with outdated ideology - and shahid has his grandfather who raised him. He runs a newspaper press of communist ideology, and as expected runs at a loss with a debt burden. The press goes into debt and is about to be seized. His grandfather suffers from Alzheimer's and is slowly slipping. The broken man needs money to fix both - what can he do? - No time to earn, what next?? So he plays by his strength - he design and prints fake currency (which is already conveyed in the trailer so this is not a spoiler) Firstly, thanks to the makers - it‚Äôs a clear message that counterfeit currency is the 2nd oldest profession in the world. So it can‚Äôt be stopped and can never be stopped. As long as there is money and a demand for money - they exist parallelly. Can the digital economy stop fake notes? - Actually not because there is a lack of ‚Äúaccountability and accountancy‚Äù on spending. An MLA uses fake notes to face an election. Only big people with big power need a big volume of fake notes ‚Äî not the ordinary rickshaw puller. So they will always find a way to make sure a parallel economy exists. Let that sink in. When two rich people involve in a shady trade, they need ‚Äúpawns‚Äù - these pawns are ordinary low-income group men who try to make some commission money across the nexus. They are easy targets for law enforcement. If they get caught, the big fish abandon them and look for new ‚Äúpawns‚Äù. Every character in Farzi is a ‚Äúpawn‚Äù - someone is a pawn to someone. Who gets killed and who escapes is the trap and tragedy. VJS is a special officer on duty to stop counterfeit currency in circulation. He goes through a personal tragedy, yet is very sincere and honest in his profession. He can sacrifice and do anything, anytime to fulfill his duty. A true patriot -(hey thanks Raj and DK for showing a Tamil guy as a patriot). Rashmi Khanna is equally a true patriot, a highly enthusiastic young blood who makes loads of mistakes due to a lack of patience and maturity. Good and clear characterization. Not to forget ‚ÄúBhuvan Arora‚Äù - Shahid‚Äôs friend - give this guy a medal. He‚Äôs the show stealer. A list of 4 people who have worked in cinematography - so you can experience change in color and tone variations in each shot - however, is of cinematic standards. Wonderful job.The script - is very convincing and not too complicated. Thanks to the 4 member team. Good jobSachin and Jigar have composed music for Farzi, who had previously worked in Family man. They know how to set the tone and mood for a scene, which they‚Äôve done perfectly. However well made they do certainly have flaws. The movement of circulation isn‚Äôt detailed and is very dramatic. Apart from the special task force, nobody shows any interest in stopping counterfeit currency - ironically, there are more people who show interest in circulating it. Maybe, that‚Äôs what the makers wanted to convey to us. A one-time worth watching.

One night, the young devadasi Kanka disappears and, as if in her place, a statue of a woman in pure gold mysteriously appears in the temple to which she was to be dedicated. Through the story of Kanaka's disappearance, Gitanjali Kolanad gives us a beautifully realized world - of priests, zamindars and devadasis, and of art, desire, and their dark reverse sides. Girl Made of Gold is a mystery, thrillingly told, and also a moving human story of the pursuit of love and freedom...\\" 1. Gitanjali Kolanad - What is Your Story? This quote from the poet Antonio Machado best expresses my life experience: ‚ÄòTraveler, there is no path/The path is made by walking.‚Äô Simply, it is the story of starting down an unconventional path and continuing to walk it. I went to a dance school in South India almost by accident. I didn‚Äôt really decide to be a dancer. My muscles and bones grew into it through practice, and suddenly one day I realized, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a dancer.‚Äô I kept dancing, when other more talented students stopped and got ‚Äòproper jobs‚Äô. That too was an option for me because of lucky circumstances of birth and education, but it also required my own determination to keep going without much encouragement or reward from the outside world. I loved dancing so much, and eventually, at a certain point, I was able to make a career out of it. It seems like my writing happened in the same haphazard way. I started writing and kept doing it until I‚Äôd written a book. 2. Tell us About your new Novel and How it Came to be? How Can Readers Get a Copy?

It is the world from which the dance form I practiced, bharata natyam, emerged, so I enjoyed doing the research, and I was able to use my own experience of being a dancer to bring the characters to life.

If you could select one piece of advice that the world needs to listen to, and bring to reality, what would it be? I‚Äôm 66 years old now, and Covid 19 completely took me by surprise. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. So my advice is not ‚ÄòExpect the unexpected‚Äô, which we are not able to do, given the myriad ways the world has to surprise us, but more ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt take this moment for granted‚Äô, pay attention to it, whatever it is. \\"Don't Take This Moment For Granted, Pay Attention to It, Whatever it is.\\" We realize now that they‚Äôve been taken away, how precious they were ‚Äì the hugs, the family gatherings, the enjoyment of performances in the company of others ‚Äì but these moments are precious too, of solitude and life slowed down and without too many distractions, and we shouldn‚Äôt wait til they‚Äôre gone in a post-Covid world to savour them. 4. What is your Secret Ingredient for a Happier and More Fulfilling life? It may seem really mundane for a secret ingredient, but it is walking. Walk. I think my best thoughts while walking. I can‚Äôt write without walking. Henry David Thoreau felt that unless he walked four hours a day he couldn‚Äôt possibly survive. I feel that if everyone walked, maybe not four hours a day, but at least one or two, the world would be a better place. And like Thoreau, I‚Äôm not talking about walking for exercise, which of course it is anyway. I‚Äôm talking about walking as a way to allow thoughts to formulate and rise to consciousness. If I sit in a chair and try to think of something to write, my thoughts are stale and boring, but the thoughts that come to me while walking are ones worth writing down. 5. What is the best advice you can give to realizing and achieving your goals in life? My advice is to find ways to be more process-oriented rather than goal-oriented. To me, it‚Äôs always seemed that if you attached more importance to and derived your sense of satisfaction from the process of whatever it is ‚Äì dancing, or writing in my case, but it could be anything, cooking or gardening or writing code, the goal and whether you achieved it would become less important. You‚Äôd be so involved and wholly concentrated on and enjoying what you were doing that something you achieved through that process would become a bonus, something extra, but not the main point.

He only had one son and heir left, and he was in Winterfell being fostered by a man who absolutely would not hesitate to kill him at the indication of insubordination by the Greyjoys. In addition, Ned had the only child out of the main four families (Baratheon, Tully, Greyjoy, Stark) who was even close in age to Theon. By raising Theon in Winterfell alongside Robb (and, I guess, Jon), Robert and Ned and Jon Arryn hoped that the future leaders of two of the kingdoms would be close friends and as near to blood brothers as Robert and Ned were.

They do nothing to grow the world‚Äôs knowledge, and therefore should not be shared. Whatever advice the question‚Äôs author is trying to acquire, no stranger on Quora knows enough about them to provide a good answer.Eliminate questions that can be easily looked up using Google or a manufacturer‚Äôs web site. Why allow that much noise? It really does make Quora harder to use for everyone ‚Äî and is just damned annoying.Eliminate questions that ask about the future. There is no knowledge involved in questions like ‚ÄúWhat will the iPhone [insert future model number here] look like?‚Äù therefore, questions like that should not be shared.Do more to encourage questions that require expertise or strong opinion. This is where Quora really shines and can make a difference. Relax merging criteria. Questions like ‚ÄúCan I use a MacBook Air to play music?‚Äù and ‚ÄúCan I use a MacBook Pro to play music?‚Äù and ‚ÄúCan I use a Mac Mini to play music?‚Äù etc. are all the same question since it is macOS that does the playing, so they should all be merged into one question. Quora all too often unmerges questions that refers to specific models. Merging more content will make Quora easier to use for everyone. I have a suggestion on how Quora can do these things without requiring a lot more manpower: create a superuser who can put questions into a ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù for review by a senior member of Quora Moderation. If it is decided they don‚Äôt meet the criteria listed above, they are deleted.

Assume we and our galaxy are moving away from the center of some hypothetical ‚Äúcenter‚Äù of the universe where a ‚Äúbig-bang‚Äù took place 13.8 billion years ago. Imagine we‚Äôre moving at 51% of light speed. Now, imagine that there is another galaxy moving directly away from us 180¬∞ across the alleged ‚Äúcenter‚Äù of the ‚Äúbig-bang‚Äù location at the same speed as us, namely 51% of light speed. Can we see them? No. They are moving away from us at 102% of the speed of light! But that doesn‚Äôt mean that either of us individually are moving anywhere near the speed limit of matter in the universe. To be clear as to distances observed however, Hubble (the telescope, not the astronomer) has picked out a few objects between 11 and 12 billion light years from earth‚Äîwhich actually in its mere 25 years of operation is pretty amazing. We‚Äôve gone from seeing a distance of two billion light years to now seeing twelve billion, in one generation. But that is a long way from the threshold of visibility for a lot more reasons than simply distance. As Viktor Toth touched on, redshift is a huge and complicated field all its own. The sun and all of the stars in our galaxy (and in millions of neighboring galaxies) have a similar and very recognizable chromatic ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù that looks fundamentally like this‚Äîassuming these color bands shown are one long continuous line: Visible light (as represented by this solar pectrograph) spans the very short range of 720nm red light to 380nm violet light. Galaxies within a billion light years will all have this same spectral profile. But a galaxy seven billion light years from earth with a redshift of 2.0 will be about completely unfamiliar in this frame of reference (visible light) because all of the so-called ‚Äúred‚Äù light will have shifted to 1440nm‚Äîand even the violet light will have shifted ‚Äúoff the chart‚Äù to 760nm which is itself well into the non-visible infrared region if the spectrum. Galaxies with a redshift of 4.0 are more than ten billion light years from earth and moving away at ¬æ of light speed. Now, even the near-ultraviolet light they emit will be redshifted completely to the infrared end of the visible spectrum, with visible light now in the range between 2880nm and 1520nm. At a distance of twelve billion light years, the galaxies are receding from us at almost 90% of light speed. Redshift is 8.0, with light stretching into the deep infrared at 5760nm to 3940nm. At a hypothetical redshift of 16.0, galaxies are moving away from us at 94% of light speed. This is where things get interesting and complicated really fast. It is a well-known fact that most stars emit well over 50% of their energy in the form of visible light. At a redshift o 16.0 all of that light is detected in the range of 7880nm to 11520nm. Human beings (like all warm-blooded mammals) have a body temperature of around 310¬∞ Kelvin. At that temperature, our bodies give off infrared radiation largely in the range of 8000 to 11000nm. The heat of a star moving away from you at 94% of light speed would be no warmer to you than putting your hand on your own face. Imagine the immense challenge of tying to actually ‚Äúsee‚Äù an object like that! It would definitely ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù long, long, long before it ever started moving away from us at over 100% of light speed."},{"prompt":"Can psychopaths experience cognitive dissonance?","completion":"Cognitive Dissonance is essentially confirmation bias.

EL222235666 TOP 6 TIPS TO LEARN ENGLISH #1. Accept That English Is a Weird Language Sometimes you can find patterns in English grammar, but other times English doesn‚Äôt make sense at all. For example, why are read (reed) and read (red) the same word, but pronounced differently depending on whether you‚Äôre speaking in the past or present tense? Or why is ‚Äúmice‚Äù the plural of ‚Äúmouse‚Äù, but ‚Äúhouses‚Äù is the plural of ‚Äúhouse‚Äù? Unfortunately, there are just as many exceptions as there are rules in English. It‚Äôs easy to get stuck on learning how to speak English properly, if you try to find a reason for everything. Sometimes English is weird and unexplainable, so instead the best thing to do is just memorize the strange exceptions and move on. Related post top 7 frree and paiid English speaking courrses: [LINKED_TEXT: Top 7 English speaking courses] [URL: https://englishtipsa2z.blogspot.com/2019/02/top-7-english-speaking-courses.html] #2. Dive into the Deep End Studying English for an hour once a week isn‚Äôt usually enough to make any real progress. The best way to quickly improve your English is to spend at least a few minutes practicing every day. Immerse yourself as much as possible every time you study, and challenge yourself to listen to, read, and even say things in English that you think might be too difficult for you. If you want to speak English fluently, you need to make it an essential part of your everyday life. #3. Stop Being a Student The right attitude can make the difference between failure and success. Stop thinking of yourself as someone who is learning English, and start thinking of yourself as someone who speaks English. It‚Äôs a small change, but it will make you feel more confident and help you to use the English you already know more effectively. This also means you need to start thinking in English. If you want to say the word ‚Äúapple‚Äù in English, for example, right now you probably think of the word in your native language first, and then try to think of the correct word in English. Instead, try imagining a picture of an apple, and then just think the English word ‚Äúapple‚Äù. Real fluency happens when you stop mentally translating conversations. #4. Get More out of Listening When most students listen to a native English-speaker, they focus on understanding what all the words mean. This is definitely important, but there is a lot more you can learn from listening. Try listening not just to what the words mean, but to how the person says them. Notice which words the person links together in a sentence, or when they say ‚Äúya‚Äù instead of ‚Äúyou.‚Äù Try to remember these details the next time you speak and your English will begin to sound more natural. Easier said than done, right? When you listen to native English speakers, it can be hard to understand every single word that is spoken. They might use many words you don‚Äôt know, talk too fast or have a strong accent. #5. Learn and Study Phrases Speaking English fluently means being able to express your thoughts, feelings and ideas. Your goal is to speak English in full sentences, so why not learn it in full sentences? You‚Äôll find that English is more useful in your everyday life if you study whole phrases, rather than just vocabulary and verbs. Start by thinking about phrases that you use frequently in your native language, and then learn how to say them in English. #6. Don‚Äôt Study Grammar Too Much The key to learning a language is finding a balance between studying and practicing. Speaking English fluently isn‚Äôt the same as knowing perfect English grammar ‚Äì even native English-speakers make grammar mistakes! Fluency is about being able to communicate. That‚Äôs why sometimes it‚Äôs important to put the grammar textbook away, so you can go out and practice those writing, reading, listening and speaking skills in the real world."},{"prompt":"Which is the best travel portal development company?","completion":"The best travel portal development is justified when it provides cheapest flight deals, hotels, buses, car rental and tour packages.

Question: #What are some reasons dogs get bad breath. Let me share best bad breath tips as below, I hope you enjoy it. 1. Good dental hygiene According to research studiesTrusted Source, poor dental hygiene is the most common cause of bad breath. Preventing plaque buildup is the key to maintaining a healthy mouth. You should brush your teeth using a fluoride toothpaste for two minutes at least twice per day (morning and night) Some people find that brushing after every meal is necessary to prevent decay and bad breath. To prevent bacteria from growing on bits of food stuck in your teeth, floss at least once per day. Bacteria can also accumulate on the tongue, causing a foul smell. A practice known as tongue scraping can help you remove this thin layer of film. Using your toothbrush or a specialized tongue scraper, brush or scrape your tongue at least once per day. Learn more about why you should be brushing your tongue. 2. Parsley Parsley is a popular folk remedy for bad breath. Its fresh scent and high chlorophyll content suggest that it can have a deodorizing effect. StudiesTrusted Source (not done on human breath, however) have shown that parsley can effectively combat foul sulfur compounds. To use parsley for bad breath, chew on fresh leaves after each meal or buy a parsley dietary supplement here. 3. Pineapple juice Many people believe that pineapple juice is the quickest and most effective treatment for bad breath. While there is no scientific evidence to back up this theory, anecdotal reports suggest that it works. Drink a glass of organic pineapple juice after every meal, or chew on a pineapple slice for one to two minutes. It‚Äôs also important to remember to rinse your mouth of the sugars in fruit and fruit juice afterward. Useful post: [LINKED_TEXT: 7 steps to save your bad breath free forever] [URL: https://badbreathtips666.blogspot.com/2019/08/7-steps-to-save-your-bad-breath-free.html] 4. Water ResearchTrusted Source shows that mouth dryness often causes bad breath. Saliva plays a very important role in keeping your mouth clean. Without it, bacteria thrive. Your mouth naturally dries out while you sleep, which is why breath is typically worse in the morning. Prevent dry mouth by keeping your body hydrated. Drinking water (not caffeinated or sugary drinks) throughout the day will help encourage saliva production. Aim for at least eight glasses of water per day. 5. Yogurt Yogurt contains healthy bacteria called lactobacillus. These healthy bacteria can help combat bad bacteria in various parts of your body, like your gut. Research shows that yogurt may also help reduce bad breath. A study found after six weeks of eating yogurt, 80 percent of participants had a reduction in bad breath. Probiotics in yogurt are effective in reducing the severity of bad breath. To use yogurt to fight bad breath, eat at least one serving per day of plain, nonfat yogurt. 6. Milk Milk is a well-known cure for bad breath. Research shows that drinking milk after eating garlic can significantly improve ‚Äúgarlicky‚Äù breath. To use this method, drink a glass of low- or full-fat milk during or after a meal containing strong-smelling foods like garlic and onions. 7. Fennel or anise seeds Since ancient times, fennel and anise seeds have been used to freshen breath. In parts of India, roasted fennel seeds are still used as ‚Äúmukhwas,‚Äù or mouth fresheners, to cleanse after-dinner breath. They taste sweet and contain aromatic essential oils that give the breath a fresh scent. Fennel and anise seeds can be eaten plain, roasted, or coated with sugar. 8. Orange Oranges not only make for a healthy dessert, but they also promote dental hygiene. Many people have bad breath because they don‚Äôt produce enough saliva to wash away foul-smelling bacteria. Research shows that vitamin C helps increase saliva production, which can help eliminate bad breath. Oranges are rich in this vitamin. 9. Zinc Zinc salts, an ingredient in certain mouthwashesTrusted Source and chewing gumTrusted Source, can counteract bad breath. Zinc works to decrease the number of sulfurous compounds in your breath. Research has shown that regular rinsing with a solution containing zinc can be effective in reducing bad breath for at least 6 months. Try a zinc chewing gum designed for people with dry mouth. You can also find zinc dietary supplements at your local drug store or purchase them online here. 10. Green tea Green tea is an effective home remedy for bad breath. ResearchTrusted Source shows that green tea has disinfectant and deodorizing properties that can temporarily freshen the breath. Mint has similar effects, so a cup of green mint tea may be an ideal breath freshener. Brew two cups of tea before going to bed and refrigerate it overnight. Pour your cool tea into a water bottle and bring it to work. Slowly sip on it throughout the day. Purchase green mint tea here. 11. Apples One studyTrusted Source found that raw apples have a powerful effect against garlic breath. Certain natural compounds in apples neutralize the foul-smelling compounds in garlic. This is particularly useful for people whose garlic breath lingers, because it neutralizes the compounds in the bloodstream, rather than just deodorizing the mouth. 12. Brush and floss more often. Plaque, the sticky buildup on your teeth, collects bacteria that cause bad breath. Trapped food also adds to the problem. Brush your teeth at least two times each day, and floss at least once. If you're concerned about your breath, do both a little more often. Don't overdo things, though. If you brush too hard you can wear down your teeth, making them vulnerable to decay. 13. Rinse your mouth out. Besides freshening your breath, a mouthwash adds extra protection by getting rid of bacteria. A fresh minty taste can make you feel good. But be sure the mouthwash you choose kills the germs that cause bad breath. Don't just cover up the smell. Rinse daily with a good mouthwash and stop bad breath at its source. You can also help your breath if you swish your mouth with plain water after you eat. It can get rid of food particles that get stuck in your teeth. 14. Scrape your tongue. The coating that normally forms on your tongue can be a host for smelly bacteria. To get rid of them, gently brush your tongue with your toothbrush. If your brush is too big to comfortably reach the back of your tongue, try a scraper. \\"They're designed specifically to apply even pressure across the surface of the tongue area. This removes bacteria, food debris, and dead cells that brushing alone can't take care of,\\" says hygienist Pamela L. Quinones, past president of the American Dental Hygienists' Association. 15. Avoid foods that sour your breath. Onions and garlic are big offenders. But brushing after you eat them doesn't help. The substances that cause their bad smells make their way into your bloodstream and travel to your lungs, where you breathe them out, says dentist Richard Price, DMD, a spokesperson for the American Dental Association. The best way to stop the problem? Don't eat them, or at least avoid them before you go to work or see friends. 16. Kick the tobacco habit. Besides causing cancer, smoking can damage your gums, stain your teeth, and give you bad breath. Over-the-counter nicotine patches can help tame the urge. If you need a little help, make an appointment with your doctor to talk about quit-smoking programs or prescription medications that can help you give up tobacco for good. 17. Skip after-dinner mints and chew gum instead. The bacteria in your mouth love sugar. They use it to make acid. This wears down your teeth and causes bad breath. Chew sugarless gum instead. 18. Keep your gums healthy. Gum disease causes bad breath. Bacteria gather in pockets at the base of teeth, which creates an odor. If you have gum disease, your dentist may suggest you see a periodontist, who specializes in treating it. 19. Try a 30-second mouthwash rinse that is alcohol-free (unike many off-the-shelf products). Mix a cup of water with a teaspoon of baking soda (which changes the pH level and fights odor in the mouth) and a few drops of antimicrobial peppermint essential oil. Don‚Äôt swallow it! (Yields several rinses.) 20. Warm Salt Water Rinse A salt water (saline solution) rinse can prevent the buildup of infectious bacteria in the mouth or throat. The effect is probably due to salt water‚Äôs slight acidity. This prevents the ‚Äòalkalizing‚Äô environment that encourages the growth of microbes that cause bad breath. Salt water is a great, simple home remedy for bad breath. 21. Exercise Daily exercises help to increase your ventilation and circulation rate. This helps to increase cellular turnover throughout your body. Exercise has also been shown to be good for maintaining microbiome health. This may help to manage harmful bugs that cause bad breath. 22. Decrease your stress Stress can change your body‚Äôs odor. One natural remedy for reducing bad breath may be to get your stress under control. Bad breath is a sign that both your immune system and microbiome aren‚Äôt working the way they should. Chronic stress can damage your immune system and reduce your ability to respond to your environment. Central to this is your microbiome. Stress as a cause of bad breath may be due to its ability to cause odor. We know stress increases sweat gland activity. These secretions interact with bacteria in your body to create body odor. However, stress itself may change your body‚Äôs bacteria. Research has shown in mice studies that the microbiome can lose diversity when exposed to chronic stress. 23. Get good quality sleep and rest Lack of sleep can negatively affect both your immune system, microbiome and stress response. We also know that sleep helps your immune system to effectively ‚Äòremember‚Äô its environment. Researchers have also found that your gut microbiome plays a role in your diurnal rhythm. If you have bad breath, it‚Äôs worth looking at your sleep patterns and trying to ensure you get enough good quality sleep. 24. Avoid dry mouth. To keep your mouth moist, avoid tobacco and drink plenty of water ‚Äî not coffee, soft drinks or alcohol, which can lead to a drier mouth. Chew gum or suck on candy (preferably sugarless) to stimulate saliva. For chronic dry mouth, your dentist or physician may prescribe an artificial saliva preparation or an oral medication that stimulates the flow of saliva. 25. Diet: Avoid onions, garlic, and spicy food. Sugary foods are also linked to bad breath. Reduce coffee and alcohol consumption. Eating a breakfast that includes rough foods can help clean the back of the tongue. 26. Try using baking soda. Brushing your teeth with baking soda once a week will help neutralize the bacteria that cause bad breath. Using your regular toothbrush, simply sprinkle a pinch of baking soda on the bristles, then brush as usual. ‚Ä¢ Baking soda can also be used as a mouthwash. Dissolve a half-teaspoon of baking soda into a small glass of water. Fill your mouth with the liquid, without swallowing, and swish it around your gums and teeth. ‚Ä¢ Baking soda neutralizes the acids that build up on the backs of your teeth, and beneath your tongue. 27. Try mouthwash. Mouthwash is another way to deal with the immediate effects of bad breath. This will only provide you with a temporary mask for the bad breath, but that can be enough to avoid offending other people. ‚Ä¢ However, an antiseptic mouthwash will kill the bad bacteria, so it will help do more than just mask the bad odor. Look for mouthwashes with hlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorine dioxide, zinc chloride and triclosan, as these kill bacteria. ‚Ä¢ Avoid using a chlorhexidine-containing mouthwash long-term as this can stain your teeth (although this is reversible). ‚Ä¢ Try not to use mouthwashes containing alcohol. Alcoholic-based mouthwashes may be a factor in developing certain mouth cancers. ‚Ä¢ Make sure you rinse and deep-gargle with mouthwash."},{"prompt":"Do all UK people say they speak ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù and not ‚ÄúBritish English‚Äù?","completion":"Do Americans say that they speak English, or American English?"},{"prompt":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute?

The hostess was irritated by our arrival and I saw some unspoken communication between hostess and staff. I‚Äôm pretty sure our waitress - though having no part in these signals - got stuck with us. Then, after our waitress had taken our order, my husband said he was experiencing extreme hunger. I found our waitress and asked if she could bring something to the table that my husband could eat right away. I expected something of an eye-roll - but she responded kindly with questions About what kind of food would be best. A minute later there was bread and butter on the table. My husband felt so much better. We bonded a little over the ‚Äúrescue‚Äù and she shared some of her life - she would be up at 6:00 am with her daughter tomorrow. I was really struck by the everyday heroism of parents. We left a 100 tip on a 44 tab. Nothing for the record books ‚Ä¶ and I confess that I wanted everyone in the restaurant to get the message - that a last minute customer can be a gift. As we were getting in our car our waitress came running out ‚Ä¶ so very moved ‚Ä¶ emotional‚Ä¶wanting to hug. I don‚Äôt think it was just the money - but the celebration of genuine caring between strangers who would never see each other again."},{"prompt":"Can someone who is wellinformed about guns tell me all the terminology related to guns?

Sure, someone could list it for you, but it will never have the same impact as you going on that mental voyage of discovery to really learn about it."},{"prompt":"For those who deny the Aryan migration theory, how can one explain the similarities between Sanskrit and European languages?","completion":"Nowadays in the age of high-speed internet and wikipedia becoming the sole source of all the knowledge (though it is considered as the most biased and questionable encyclopedia of all time) and with information overload on the internet, We are witnessing many people becoming self-proclaimed expert on Indian history and culture, but in reality they are just another victim of western and communist idea of universalism. Universalism in its primary sense, refers to Religious, Theological, Philosophical and Philological concepts with universal applicability. Given the economic, political and military dominance of Western civilization over the past several centuries, Universalism has become a Western prerogative; and the concepts universally applied have invariably derived from Western traditions and Grand Narrative. Many concepts of Western universalism originate from precepts rooted in the belief systems of abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and Many concept of Communist universalism originate from precepts rooted in the belief systems of scientific socialism and historical materialism. The aggressive aspects of abrahamic religions, such as their expansionist impulse to impose synthetic unity, and their lack of mutual respect, push them to consume other competing systems. One of the key methods by which abrahamic religions effect this consumption is through cultural digestion. The term ‚Äúdigestion‚Äù to describe the widespread dismantling, rearrangement and assimilation of a less powerful civilization into a dominant one. As with the food consumed by a predator, whatever is useful becomes assimilated into the predator‚Äôs biology, while whatever does not fit the predator‚Äôs needs is eliminated as waste. The West superimposes its concepts, aesthetics, language, paradigms, historical template and philosophy on other civilizations, positioning these as universal. The corresponding elements of the digested civilization become domesticated into Western thought, are reinvented as the intellectual property of Western civilization, and cease to exist in their own right. The result is that the consumed tradition, similar to the food, is destroyed; whereas the predator gets strengthened. In harvesting the fruits of other civilizations, the West has often destroyed their roots, thereby terminating their ability to produce any more bountiful harvests. INDIA is one such example‚Ä¶.. The Language concept of Proto Indo-European -> Indo-European -> Indo-Iranian -> Indo-Aryan, is a hypothetical concept and some even call it nothing but a farce.. due to lack of proper unbiased and open-minded research this concept is now not widely accepted and debate is still on‚Ä¶ One of the most detailed study on Aryan languages is done by philologists from islamic azad university Iran in collaboration with Ecole normale sup√©rieure, Paris, In their study‚Ä¶.. They out-rightly rejected the concept of Indo-European Language family and theorized that Various European Languages and Asian Languages developed as Language Isolate, and due to the close Proximity of their speakers or contact with one-another, and their engagement in the form of Trade, Cultural exchanges, Friendly interaction and War they influence one-another either becoming Sub-stratum or Super-stratum and in due process they borrowed some Loanwords, Phonetics and Morphology from one-another languages and in some cases developed entirely into New Language where sometimes the Parent language becomes extinct. Though there are many hypothesis regarding which Language isolate developed first and its sub-stratum and super-stratum on other Languages, In their reseach they theorised some of these Language isolates : Pre Proto Germanic - Early Proto Germanic - Late Proto Germanic - Proto Germanic Proto Balto Slavic Kartvelian Proto-Sabellic Proto Greek Proto Liburnian Hattic Eteocypriot Basque Korean Ainu Nivkh Munda Proto Elamite - Elamite - Burushaski - Dravidian Kusunda Nihali and Pre Proto Aryan Pre Proto Aryan which developed into Proto Aryan, The Proto Aryan further branched out into Proto Aryan west whereas the the Proto Aryan remains unchanged. Proto Aryan west further divided into Proto Aryan Far West and Proto Aryan central (known as Proto Indo European), The Proto Aryan central further divided into Iranian West and Iranian East (known as Avestan) which further developed into Old Iranic (Median, Scythian, Parthian, Bactarian etc.) Iranian west and Old Iranic are ancestors of Iranic Group of Languages. Where as Proto Aryan Far west further developed as Dacian, Tharcian, Phonecian, Phrygian, Illyrian, Luwian, Lydian, Palaic, Milyan, Carian, Sidetic, Pisidian, Isaurian, Cappadocian, Mysian, Dacian, Minoan, and lost to Summerian, Elamite, Akkadian and Canaanite Languages and becomes extinct in those regions. The Old Iranic with Sub-stratum of Western branch of Proto Mongolic Language developed into Turkick Language, On the other hand The Proto Aryan (Early Vedic Sanskrit) - developed into Vedic Sanskrit and further into Late Vedic Sanskrit. The Late Vedic Sanskrit further simplified and Developed into Classical Sanskrit - Early Classical Sanskrit (outside Indian Subcontinent as Hurrian, Kassites, Uratian and Hitite) - Middle Classical Sanskrit - Late Classical Sanskrit. The Late Classical Sanskrit with Sub-stratum of Western branch of Middle Mongolic Language and Old Iranic developed into Hunnic Language. The Late Classical Sanskrit becomes Subs-stratum of Eastern branch of Tibeto Burman and Super-stratum of Western Himalayan Languages. The Late Sanskrit further simplified into Bhasha. The Bhasha further branched into Apabhransha, The Bhasha (Grammatically correct) and Apabhransha (Non Grammatical version of Bhasha) The Bhasha and Apabhransha becomes Subs-stratum of Eastern branch of Tibeto Burman and Super-stratum of Western Himalayan Languages. The Bhasha and Apabhransha Both later developed into various Prakrit Languages (Period of Siddhartha Gautama and Jain Tirthankars). The most notable Prakrits were Saurseni, Apabhransha, Pali, Gandhari, Magadhi and Maharashtri. Saurseni and Apabhransha were the direct ancestor of Sanskritized Hindi which later developed into Modern Hindustani with some influence from surrounding Languages like Persian, Turkic, Arabic and Dravidian. There are many Linguistically recognized dialects of Hindustani and some are unrecognized dialects which are confined to small pockets of rural areas used by small group of people. The Hindi is the sole Language of states of Uttar pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Capital Territory of Delhi, and by Majority in Himanchal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Partially in J&k, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Gujrat, Sikkim and Assam. You can find people who understand Hindi all over India all thanks to bollywood. The Hindustani is spoken in many dialects which changes with every 200 km in any direction you go."},{"prompt":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","completion":"I think I will change the way India obtained its Freedom from British.

It *can* be resisted, but only at substantial political cost as long as the society in question has large portions of its people making the assumption that the government is there to do more than defend them from physical invasion. That ‚Äúmore‚Äù being the assumption the government is also there to also allocate resources to uplift them economically without them changing themselves. This can produce great strain on any government that refuses to rely on any single resource, mined, drilled, grown, or otherwise. When taxes *are* spread throughout the population, then *some* of those with less will want ‚Äúleveling‚Äù efforts in favor of themselves, without them having to adapt to markets at all.

To the extent the government is strong enough in adhering to market principles, then they can resist the resource curse. Too few are, because it means telling those that work for them that they won‚Äôt be rewarded as much as they could be. Few populations are still willing to adapt to markets, and adapt again and again, in the knowledge that some markets have made others richer, without visible work. The government that resists the curse must push their population to adapt again and again and again, to markets. Otherwise, the 4% who assume they should be as rich as the next guy, without changing their behaviors, will win in the end."},{"prompt":"What is something that you will never do?","completion":"This silent comedy video get only 3 k views, but many video which have less comedy get million videos"},{"prompt":"w do you calculate","completion":"Take Sn=n/2 *(A1+An), where ‚ÄòA1‚Ä≤ for the first term and ‚ÄòAn‚Äô for the last term. substitute; 10/2 *(1+10) 5*11=55 The answer 55, where ‚Äôn‚Äô is the number of terms and not the last term in a group of consecutive numbers.

The most common proof of identity used is a drivers license, but a passport will also do. Depending on the state there will be other options. My fathers parents did not register any of their childrens births at home during the 1920s, so none of them had birth certificates. My dad and his brother got theirs around 1950 to enlist in the Air Force during the Korean War. I remember going with my grandmother to get birth certificates for my aunts in the early 70s. My aunts were approaching retirement age, and they had not needed birth certificates to enroll in school, get married, get jobs, vote, or get Social Security cards and drivers licenses. But under new laws, they would need them to apply for Social Security benefits. My grandmother was in her 80s and in frail health, and my grandfather had died. If she had died before registering my aunts births, they would have had a lot of trouble getting their benefits. My grandmother went to the County Courthouse and swore out an affidavidt that she had given birth to this person on this date in this place and was able to get my aunts birth certificates. But she needed to produce her drivers license in order to prove her identity. By the way, she had not needed her birth certificate to collect SS benefits, when they began. Her birth in 1890 was registered but the courthouse and all its records were destroyed in a fire, so she didn't have a copy of it. She didn't need it to get her driver's license either. In fact, when she got her license, all you needed to do was write the state and request one. She just kept renewing it every year, even though she never learned to drive. Eventually it came in handy for proof of identity when she needed it."},{"prompt":"What is your worst cinema experience?","completion":"Say what if you go to a Horror Movie and a comedy breaks out and you can‚Äôt quit laughing.

What if I tell you, you can be happy even at 15K per month using a simple income and expense tracker at home? What we have in this tracker is basically a normal livelihood that can be turned into a Rich lifestyle through patience and consistency. Let me show you how I made a table consisting of age, retirement age and in-hand salary. Next, I divided the years of service into different parts. If someone starts a career at 21 then 39 years of service so you can get by giving your age in the above type. Based on years of experience I have given normal ratings/increments here. Usually, it is only 4 rows that will be applicable but you never know some can work till 65 years as a lecturer in a private institute or tuition center or as freelancers. Next, I have divided the salary received into 3 buckets ‚Äì Needs, Wants, and Investment. What are Needs? it can be basic necessities in life like bills, rent, etc. Wants can be anything extra that you desire to get every month. It can be new accessories, clothes, fancy items, phones, etc. Investments are mutual funds, bank FD, etc. Now In hand salary usually is after all deductions so PF, gratuity I am not including in the spreadsheet. Now lets divide the amount per category assuming the preferences. Now I am also taking Inflation at a standard rate you can change as per your wish. Money Inflation 5% Needs inflation 5% Wants inflation 5% Now I will divide the investment into 2 categories ‚Äì equity and fixed so that we are not taking too much risk ,you can change that too. Within investments Share of Fixed Return Investments 40% Share of Equity Investments 60% Fixed Rate of Return? 7% Equity Rate of Return 14% Tax? 15% Now the tax on investment will keep at 15%. As fixed is 30% and equity after one year is 10% so average is 15%. Now let's see the result. For that, I have done 4 sheets. 1. Setup ‚Äì the above-described points. 2. Salary ‚Äì Every year projections of salary based on increment decided. 3. Expenses ‚Äì it is based on Needs and wants percentage. 4. Investment ‚Äì It is based on type of investment and rate of return. Let see the bigger picture for a person earning 15K per month at age 22. At age 35, he will be having approximately 55 lakhs based on the factors mentioned above. Now let's assume he has expenses like wanting a car, marriage, and other things to have in life. Now you can decide the luxury in the expenses page. Let me show you- Now see the investment column for the result. The marriage expenses is as of today but the investment page will take the inflation and rupee value at that time and give us an estimated figure. In this way, you can also calculate the various things in your life. Making money is the easiest thing if you have an income and expenses tracker.

There's not enough info for me to give really good advice, unfortunately. Do your parents know more about what's wrong with her and just haven't shared? This happens sometimes, not always intentionally. They may know she has kidney failure and not communicated it to you.You have asked and they aren't explaining.They are worried about the vet bill for treatment and have it in their head they won't be able to afford it. (as cold as this sounds, it's a valid concern for many people.)The cat‚Äôs age. A young cat is most likely suffering from a UTI, an old cat it could still be a UTI but could also be kidney failure, cancer, etc. These are things to consider. Probably some others, too, that I haven't thought of, but the answers to these details would help a lot. I don't usually hear of vets euthanizing perfectly healthy animals. If a vet agrees to euthanize, it usually means the poor animal is really, really sick. My sweet Calypso was a grey striped/spotted introvert. She was old. Two years ago she began doing the same as your cat. At first it was a UTI, and we got a round of antibiotics. She was fine for a week or two. Then it started again. Another round of antibiotics, and she was fine again. A month later it started again, and this time didn't stop. Turns out her kidneys were failing. She couldn't hold it anymore, and would even leak pee when she slept. She began to show obvious signs of pain. She quit drinking and eating. There comes a time in every pet owner's life when they have to make a hard choice. I decided that my desire to keep her with me did not override her health and comfort. Keeping her while in obvious pain and degenerating health wasn't kind to her, it would be my own selfish desire. I made the appointment and then sat on my back porch and bawled into a pillow. Our family loved her up as much as we could those last few days. I took her to the vet, and held her. She passed away in my hands, happy and at peace. In our case, it was best for her. I don't know the particulars of your situation. This may help or it may not. My advice is to ask your parents, politely, and honestly: ‚ÄúI'm trying to understand, help me understand. Could she just have a UTI? Or is she really sick? Knowing will help me understand this decision.‚Äù Asking that will show them you're mature enough to be in on it, and mature enough to have difficult conversations.

And the ‚Äúevents‚Äù in that story occur in all logically-possible time orderings. However, in that QED picture, any one photon does only 3 things: get emitted, propagate, and get absorbed. They do not experience any other events, so the ‚Äúsequences‚Äù consist of only 3 events. And those 3 events can be regarded as happening in reverse order with reversed names ‚Äî both contribute. So all 2 orderings happen. In a non-QED non-fundamental view of things, a photon could, e.g. pass thru a sequence of 57 prisms changing direction each time. (The QED view would be: it is no longer the same photon.) In that non-QED view, note the photon travels slower than lightspeed inside the glass (not a vacuum). Or photon could pass thru some sugar solutions, changing its polarization. Again: slower than lightspeed. So in this non-QED view, there no longer can be any claim in these situations that these photons ‚Äúcannot experience time.‚Äù They do."},{"prompt":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","completion":"When I have a lot of people working for me, I usually do what‚Äôs called set-up meetings.

When we say, theory of Everything, we mean physical theory of Everything. String Theory is a way to describe all particles and forces and also some of the mysterious things that we haven‚Äôt heard about or looked about and describing things like Tachyons, Dark matter, Dark Energy, and many other weird peculiar phenomenon like solving the Black Hole information paradox by 1 Dimensional String like Structures, vibrating at a certain rate to produce different particles and forces and everything which we have looked at is one way or the other, is Stringy. Strings occupy a line in Space at each instance in Time mathematically represented by the World Sheets. There is a really rich geometry of the joining and splitting of the Strings. Some say that String theory has undertaken, because we can‚Äôt describe everything, using a Single equation of tiny piece of vibrating strings but some are followers to this thing. Others say that we haven‚Äôt even completed the whole physics, first we have to complete it and only then, we have to reach this physical TOE. Nevertheless, String Theory has actually stimulated many developmental branches of Pure mathematics and yet still it is in a theoretical superposition of both being as right and as Wrong. We don‚Äôt have any empirical evidence for String Theory. The Strings in String theory don‚Äôt have masses and a String with 0 Friction will continuously vibrate and a String with say 100 friction will completely stop. Every string has a certain frequency, wavelength and amplitude. We have two Strings, open String, which are strip like Strands and Closed Strings which are the sort of loop like Structures. A String vibration is a Standing Wave. The world sheet of the open Strings are strip like while the World Sheet of the closed String will be like the legs of the trouser and the loops represent the Strings. String Theory at the start was a the theory for protons, neutrons and mesons, but later on it became a contender for Theory of everything. String Theory talks about the particles called the Super-symmetric particles and these Strings need minimum 10 Space-time dimensions to even vibrate. String Theory is the mathematical extension of what we think of as the Quantum Field theories and also if and if Space-time is Extra Dimensional, then there is a certain mathematical possibility for the existence of Extra Dimensional Quantum Fields. We are trying our best to find the good results. String Theory‚Äôs math is absolutely correct."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between a newspaper and newsletter?","completion":"A newspaper is produced for public consumption.

What is it made up of? Will we be able to create it?","completion":"In the words of Richard Feynman: ‚ÄúNew Theories require strong evidence.‚Äù Many of today‚Äôs cosmological incongruities can be solved by considering space as having inertial properties that emerge whenever accelerations are involved. Accelerations are always an inveterate feature of rotational motion of any kind. Newton‚Äôs 2nd law serves up an enigma that has never been resolved ‚Ä¶. how is it that empty space can oppose acceleration of matter? The modern method of treating mysteries is commonly addressed by inventing new particles - When a certain mass for a particle is needed, it is later found or assigned by tailoring experimental results to what is needed for the theory. Most significantly, how it performs the task(s) it was invented to explain, is never explained. Nothing gets verified directly - only be implication - selected results not in conflict with the existence of the new particle are taken as verification of the particle‚Äôs existence, even though the same result also admits other solutions that do not embrace the particle. That the particle actually functions in the manner intended, is never actually verified, at least in the sense of explaining how the particle performs the task it was invented to resolve. Moreover, such particles are short lived - and their operative mechanism for transmitting force is postulated. Calling again upon Richard Feynman. In his frustration as to why the electron‚Äôs angular momentum was always h/4(pi) in every direction, he lamented: ‚ÄúUnderstanding these matters comes slowly, if at all.‚Äù In summary, the ‚Äúexplanation of forces‚Äù which have become the standard model of modern physics, should be viewed with skepticism. There are other options, ones that actually predict the magnitude of the forces from facts. Note: I had written this answer for another question - somehow when two answers get merged into a common question, one may not address the question very well. In my lost answer I pointed out an alternative explanation as to why the velocity profiles of spiral galaxies are flat. To this question, I would submit, dark matter is an unimaginative solution‚Ä¶.if it happens to be true and eventually verified, I will be surprised, and dine on crow. In the last part of my former answer, I included a paragraph as to how the velocity profile of spiral galaxies could be explained in terms of circulatory space. As has been noted in the literature, rotating black holes are theorized to acquire rotational accretion discs. For similar reasons, the billions of stars orbiting in the plane of spiral galaxies may effect a co-rotational spatial component. If so, this could reduce the gravitational requirement required to explain the nearly flat velocity profiles. A smaller [m(v^2)/R] centripetal force would be required from gravitational sources in a co-rotating ambient spatial environment."},{"prompt":"According to a conservative relative of mine, if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency she will make the U.S. into a socialist country.

Of course we haven‚Äôt lost hope. Quite the contrary. There are dozens of papers appearing on [LINKED_TEXT: arXiv.org] [URL: http://arxiv.org/] every day, exploring new possibilities that might lead to unification of quantum physics and gravity. Now it is true that the easy approaches turned out to be dead ends. The so-called canonical quantization of gravity leads to a theory that is not renormalizable. And the bubbling optimism of a few decades ago, when it seemed that a unified theory is just a symmetry group away, has evaporated. But that is not a loss of hope! It is simply a realization that we need to re-evaluate our approach when it comes to gravity. And that a unified theory will likely have some unexpected features. Which is why people explore everything from string theory to entropic gravity. One difficulty, of course, is that it is hard to come up with a theory that can be validated by experiment, gravity being as weak as it is. But that‚Äôs no reason to lose optimism. As a matter of fact, ‚Äúoptimism‚Äù and ‚Äúhope‚Äù are not even the right words to use here. No physicist that I know doubts that Nature is fundamentally logical, free of contradictions. Which means that the very fact that we observe quantum phenomena and gravity in the same Universe tells us that there is a consistent, unified, logical (mathematical) framework for both. Its existence is not in doubt‚Ä¶ the task is finding this framework, which proved tougher than anyone anticipated, say, one half or three quarters of a century ago. But that challenge is no reason to lose hope; rather, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs invigorating. As for the required motivation, no, it‚Äôs not money. (Take my case. I produced a fair amount of respectable research, without ever being paid a penny as a physicist. Most of the professional physicists that I worked with would continue what they do even if, like me, they‚Äôd have to do something else on the side to earn a living.) It is curiosity. It is the desire to understand. It is the joy we derive when finally the equations connect, the predictions match the data, and the whole thing begins to make sense."},{"prompt":"Why is Gov.

Some of the most common reasons include: Fear: Some people may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they are afraid of leaving, whether it's fear of being alone, fear of retaliation, or fear of not being able to financially support themselves.Low self-esteem: People with low self-esteem may believe that they don't deserve better treatment, or that they are not capable of being in a healthy relationship.Cultural or societal pressures: Some people may feel pressure from their culture or society to stay in a relationship, regardless of how unhealthy or abusive it is.Lack of support: Some people may not have access to support systems, such as friends, family, or professional help, that could help them leave an unhealthy or abusive relationship.Hope for change: Some people may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they believe that their partner will change, or that things will get better over time.Love and emotional attachment: People may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they love or are emotionally attached to their partner, and find it difficult to let go.Financial dependence: Some people may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they are financially dependent on their partner, and they fear they will not be able to support themselves if they leave.Children: People may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they want to keep their family together, and they fear that leaving will harm their children. It's worth noting that, Leaving an unhealthy or abusive relationship can be difficult, but it's important to remember that no one deserves to be treated poorly, and that there are resources and support available to help people leave. It's also important to understand that it is not the victim's fault and they should not be made to feel guilty for staying in an unhealthy or abusive relationship."},{"prompt":"Which Bollywood movie has a very effective, well crafted, and brilliant climax scene?","completion":"For me the answer to this question is Imtiaz Ali's [LINKED_TEXT: Highway] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_(2014_Hindi_film)] starring Alia Bhatt and Randeep Hooda. There is a certain tranquility and serenity about the story.The story is of somebody recognising what freedom is and taking that choice. The protagonist falls in love with nature. In climax,she abandons her marriage plans and instead starts living in the mountainous countryside and also starts her own small scale business there. It has been shot traversing over six states in buses and trucks. The shooting unit used to be like a kaafila (caravans), which used to move from place to place. It was shot chronologically with linear narration. There was travelling in Highway but the route taken in the film wasn‚Äôt the regular tourist route. It has been shot in isolated areas. The actress esaays a cine matic character. Her heartbreaking naivety justifies behavioral brain-fades; she makes us believe when she suddenly opens up to her Haryanvi kidnapper and she makes us believe when she breaks down by a quiet mountain stream. Highway is the soul every filmmaker works towards; a script too raw to make as a first film, but placed at the bottom of the pile as a reminder to believe. It's difficult to do those roles where there are few lines. Under intense pressure, humans can weep, laugh, dance, scream, fall in or out of love instantaneously, and it's impossible to explain this logically where there are very few lines to deliver. The tone and geography of the story changes and feel of these states support the film at that time when it travels through that state. For instance, there is a certain horrifying quality about a vast empty desert which comes at a point in the film where the horrific quality is required to give tone to the film. When you are in lush meadows there is a sense of belonging and completion, which by the time you reach Kashmir the film already feels like that. -Imtiaz Ali"},{"prompt":"w do I see who liked something on Twitter?","completion":"Method 1.

Most of my teenage years I have been an expert at self-deprecation, something I think might be strongly attributed to being British. We are the best at it. However on reflection, I'm really proud of the ways I've changed in the last 5 years. I'd say five years ago I was insecure and making decisions in life because I wanted to fit in and be liked but I can now say I've finally come into my own person over that span of time. This is me 5 years ago - I remember thinking that I was a lot heavier than my friend and was really envious of how thin she was. It's laughable. This is me at 16 years old. We were so used to people telling us we didn't look or act our age but sixteen felt so old. This is me at 17 - I had the side of my head shaved, read John Taylor Gatto books and decided I hated institutionalised education. 18 - I finally figured I had no idea what I was going to do with the rest of my life and felt completely and utterly screwed, half thought alcohol would fix that issue. This is me today - I have no idea what I'm doing, my 5 year plan is not set in stone because it's not in my nature to follow up with any long term plans I make and honestly, I couldn't be happier despite that.

Berkshire Hathaway/ Warren Buffet uses options to generate additional income from the firm‚Äôs equity positions. For instance, if he holds AAPL and has a certain target price to sell, he will write calls for AAPL at the strike price that is his target price. When the market price is below the call‚Äôs strike price, he simply collects the premium. When the market price hits the call‚Äôs strike price, he will just proceed to sell his AAPL shares when the option‚Äôs buyers exercise. By doing this, he can generate additional income from his equity position, besides capital gain and dividends. The same can be done by writing puts on his holding if Mr. Buffet wants to accumulate new shares at a given price that is lower than the market price."},{"prompt":"Why would anyone need a gun with more than 10 rounds for concealed carry?","completion":"Because: 1) in a self defense situation, you are NOT going to hit the bad guy with every single shot. 2) what if there are two or three bad guys? 3) because except for a few uber liberal states who know better than you do what you ‚Äúneed,‚Äù the law doesn't set a maximum for the number of bullets your gun can carry.

This signature colour comes from the large amount of a chemical called iron oxide in its rocks and soil. 3) Mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system after Mercury. With a diameter (distance through the middle) of 6,791 kilometres, it‚Äôs roughly half the size of Earth. 4) It can get pretty cold on Mars ‚Äì‚Äì much colder than our own planet, since it‚Äôs further away from the sun. At the equator, temperatures can reach 20¬∞C, but at its poles they can plummet to as low as -140¬∞C. Brr! 5) Mars is home to the highest mountain in our solar system ‚Äì‚Äì a volcano called Olympus Mons. Standing a whopping 24 kilometres high, it‚Äôs about three times the height of Mount Everest! 6) You could jump around three times higher on Mars than you can on Earth. Boing! This is because the planet‚Äôs gravity ‚Äì the force that keeps us on the ground ‚Äì is much weaker. 7) Mars has two moons! One is called Phobos and the other Deimos. 8) A day on Mars is 24 hours and 37 minutes ‚Äì‚Äì only a little bit longer than a day on our own planet. A year on Mars, however, is almost twice as long, lasting 687 Earth days! This is because it takes a lot longer than Earth to complete its orbit around the Sun. 9) Until recently, scientists believed that there was no liquid water on the surface of Mars ‚Äì‚Äì only rocks, soil dust and ice. But‚Ä¶ News flash! In 2018, they found evidence of a lake under the planet‚Äôs south polar ice cap. Exciting stuff! 10) Humans have not yet been to Mars, but scientists have sent spacecraft there to help them research this fascinating planet. The first spacecraft to land on Mars were the Viking Landers, which touched down on the surface in 1976. ~Love Love ‚ô•Ô∏è"},{"prompt":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","completion":"Make [LINKED_TEXT: dubai hotel booking] [URL: https://www.damacmaison.com/en/book-direct-privileges/] direct on the official website and get special rates.

Part of the reason is that an overwhelming majority of the great art of the time was commissioned. Artists created to fill orders, not as a personal expression of their craft. People like Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Botticelli‚Äî they were looked at as craftsmen not immortals.

The reality is all modalities of input are converging to just about all devices. Devices are also converging to each other. What we perceive as a laptop today will not look like the laptop we see in the future. We have all become acclimated to typing on glass and gesturing on glass. In fact more people do this today than use any other modality of input. On 9/7/2016 (this was written on 9/2/2016) Apple will release a transitional MacBook Pro that will begin to have elements from iOS devices. This transition may very well include active touch screen(s). We will also see Touch ID and perhaps other iOS features. Future versions of the Apple laptop line will be essentially two glass surfaces that are hinged together. The surface that operates as the keyboard will be a touch screen with haptic feedback that will go a very long way to simulate a full motion keyboard. Indeed many of us will miss the mechanical keyboard, but the arc of change will just about antiquate it in the next 10 years. The concept of a trackpad versus gesturing on glass is confounding to anyone switching between devices. Apple has tried to bridge this gap, but clearly the gesturing on glass is the direction of momentum. Additionally the generation that has been raised on tablets already does not miss the physical keyboard and can type faster on glass and generally dislike the very concept of the limited track pad, much like an earlier generation disliked using scrolling key pads over a mouse. The keyboard surface will also operate as a super sized track pad. This surface will be an active surface that can display information just like the display screen. Both surfaces will of course be touch screens. At some point in the next 5 years, iOS and macOS will converge. I predict this will be through a new version of an Intel based processor. At that point the lines will be further blurred between tablet and laptop. I have been a student of Apple patents for about 30 years and can say with a high degree of certainty that Apple has been innovating around this convergence for quite sometime with a fair degree of intellectual property supporting this direction. Here is one example ([LINKED_TEXT: Published Applications Database Search Results:] [URL: http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=20160098107.PGNR].) The generation raised on iPads and iPhones have grown to understand a ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù to be a device with a touch screen. This is exampled in any visit to a middle school where children are constantly touching the screen to move objects. I experience this first hand with my children (and myself frankly). I was so intrigued by this phenomena I conducted a study with the school my children attended last year. The results were shocking, 82% of the time the children continue to touch the screen during their use of the laptops. They become frustrated when they can not move objects on the screen via this method. They see this modality as natural. If your experience was with a classic computer using a touch pad or mouse your frame of reference is from the past. If your frame of reference is from touch screens the empirical evidence is you tend to expect computer screens to interact and navigate via touch. As confounding as this assertion may be to current purists in OS and UX design, it is the way of people. The very concept of a laptop or tablet will dissolve, at some point in 10 years there will be no separation between the two modalities."},{"prompt":"What is a hygge nursery?","completion":"A nursery with a quality of coziness and comfortable conviviality that engenders a feeling of contentment or well-being (regarded as a defining characteristic of Danish culture).

Wonderfully rich characters, female and male, some suspension of disbelief yields an open-ended universe of nearly familiar science and technology, but never boring. The feudal organization of the civilization is profoundly dystopian, as is the wide range of half-hidden powers and interests that Chris, Pat and Toby Sixpack never chose and can‚Äôt escape. But we‚Äôve still got a long way to go. The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress. As concise an illustration of a libertarian world as I‚Äôve ever read. Like most older Sci-Fi, the characters default to heterosexual males, but some have female names and change is rumbling out on the horizon. One character is a computer, and its a better imagined and more interesting computer than most. The protagonist and computer discuss humor, as any real people might. Last and First Men, Starmaker. Two shorter novels in a single binding, sorta like White Fang and the Call of the Wild. Wildly imaginative, stranger and more engaging than Niven‚Äôs Known Space even if the characters are, again, default male. Written during the rise of 20th century Fascism, the cult of ‚Äúbeast men‚Äù is a recurring threat to the First, Last and intermediate humans. Our descendants change bodies and planets as the galaxy turns. Author Olaf Stapleton is undaunted by big stories. In Starmaker, the crisis of consciousness that followed the industrial revolution (hmmm was Malthus just plain wrong?

Give a prediction of how many seats BJP will gain in each state.","completion":"I think BJP wants to beat both Nehru, in achieving the third full term and Rajiv in crossing 400 seats. I think BJP+ will win again for sure. But 400 seats might be impossible. They will still be in 300 seats vicinity +/‚Äî 20. I can't analyse State by State, but think they will suffer some erosion in the Hindi Belt. But will make gains in the South, Telangana, AP, Karnataka and even TN. A lot depends on how much of a mess the opposition parties make. For example, BJD in Odisha is very prudent and behaves sensibly when it comes to national affairs, that's the reason BJP hasn't been able to dislodge Naveen Patnaik. But others aren't that sensible and give a lot of opening to BJP. The worst case scenario for BJP, is if Congress agrees not to compete in State where neither they nor BJP is on power, at least for the LS elections and transfers their votes.

You see it everywhere every day it's so popular and it can pay off easily if you know where exactly to invest. Affiliate marketing is an advertising model in which a company compensates third-party publishers to generate traffic or leads to the company‚Äôs products and services. The third-party publishers are affiliates, and the commission fee incentivizes them to find ways to promote the company. That being said, it's about promoting the product of various vendors across the platforms such as Digistore24 (Europe) and Clickbank (USA/international) and gaining commission fee in return. Both affiliates and vendors make money out of it. The best and most efficient way to succeed in affiliate marketing is using platforms such as Facebook Ads and Google Ads, along with WordPress which many people use as well in order to promote products.

In every way imaginable. Our current grading system does not even remotely reflect what educational research shows to be best development practice. I‚Äôm basing this off the typical A-F grading scale where an F is 59% and below, with increasing letter grades every ten percent afterwards. (D = 60‚Äì69%, C = 70‚Äì79%, etc.) The standard American grading system does not articulate to students their actual level of mastery over the material and application of skills. Think back to your youth for a moment, and about an assignment you received a letter grade for that you actually remember. What does that letter grade mean? I‚Äôm dead serious. What does it mean? How does it inform the student about what they have accomplished and at what level they have accomplished it? Above average? What is the average? How was the average calculated? For a math test, this might be straightforward, but what about more qualitative-based assessments in fields like language arts? How do you reduce creative writing to a formulaic assessment? A ‚ÄúB+‚Äù is an utterly meaningless piece of information to a student, especially when it comes to mastery of the content and skills. What does a B+ tell a student about how to improve? Now, a teacher could add some comments to that B+ about what the student could do better next time, maybe even offer some concrete strategy suggestions for improvement. But it still doesn‚Äôt address the fundamental problem: what does proficiency look like? The standard American grading system sets a bar of passage that is exceptionally lower than what we require for proficiency. In the typical American A-F grading scale, a ‚ÄúD‚Äù is considered a below average, yet passing score. Why? Setting aside the whole issue of how 75% mastery constitutes average in the first place, why would we settle for acceptable proficiency being 60%? And 60% of what, precisely? This was one of the realizations I had in my first year of teaching. I had students who were doing the absolute bare minimum to pass, but were not learning key, critical concepts and skills. They had a 60% aggregate, and that was good enough for them. When I tried to bring this to the attention of the principal, he was initially on board with my revised ‚Äúrequired proficiencies‚Äù policy, where I required students to achieve at least a score of proficient on assignments that showed me whether they‚Äôd met the standards or not. Initially, that was everything, but the principal negotiated down to 2‚Äì3 key critical assignments per quarter. And then two varsity baseball players didn‚Äôt meet proficiency on required quarter-end projects. I gave them incompletes and time to fix their assignments. Their projects were around C+ level, and their overall grades were B-ish. But, they hadn‚Äôt taken the assignment entirely seriously and had not bothered to include one of the required aspects of the project. I assume they did the point calculation and realized that they‚Äôd have enough of an aggregate score to pass, proficiency on standards be damned. I held my ground. Within 15 minutes of my submitting the quarterly grades, the principal walked into my room and told me I had to change it. I explained the policy we‚Äôd agreed to, and showed him how the students hadn‚Äôt met it. He told me to either change the grade to the average of what they‚Äôd earned out of total points for the quarter or he‚Äôd hold me insubordinate and fire me. Those two students never did show me basic proficiency of two key standards that I knew they would need in their next year‚Äôs courses, to say nothing of the state test that I would be held to account for the following fall. That‚Äôs right. I have to get the students to about the equivalent of a B on the state test. But the students only have to have a D to pass my class. I cannot retain them and make sure they learn key skills if they are between those two scores, but I get punished if they don‚Äôt. The current grading system doesn‚Äôt motivate students. Even the go-getters are not motivated by the current grading system. I had some students that were A students and would freak out getting a 98% because that could put their valedictorian battle in jeopardy. But the level of proficiency was not the motivator. If they scored high enough, they never bothered to look at my feedback. They would scan the document or rubric, make sure they got the right number, and recycle it. I watched them, frustrated and irritated, chucking at least ten minutes‚Äô worth of work from me into the garbage without so much as scanning my suggestions and commentary. I gave one essay assignment just numbers. No comments, just numbers. Only one student said anything at all about it, and it was simply curiosity. The freak-out go-getters? They didn‚Äôt want to improve themselves. They wanted to get to their 100%. That‚Äôs it. They would ask me what they had to do to get it. I‚Äôd ask them about their process, their strategies, why they did what they did, ask them to self-reflect on how well certain things worked for them. And I‚Äôd watch them get visibly upset by this. They didn‚Äôt want to think about this. They didn‚Äôt want to learn how to be better writers in the future. They wanted a formula to fix it and get the points and move on. I realized that I had to teach my students how to be students. They had been boxed into being cookie-cutter people who did precisely what was required of them and nothing more. There was no creativity. No strategic thinking. No conceptualization. No learning. To curve or not to curve‚Ä¶ The current scoring system is meaningless, but that‚Äôs not even where it ends. It‚Äôs not even consistent. We set the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù at 75%. So, what happens if everyone messes with the average and it really works out to something other than 75%? We ‚Äúcurve‚Äù the grades and redistribute them them with a 75% mean and a normal distribution outside of that. If all the students do exceptionally well and everyone reaches 95%+ because the teacher did a great job and the students all learned something, what happens? Do they all get A‚Äôs for mastery? Nope. Because we have to rank them, see? We have to decide who ‚Äúwins.‚Äù And if they‚Äôre all bunched up together, that‚Äôs hard to do, especially if they‚Äôre all bunched together at the top. And so a student who has clearly mastered the material ends up with a C, because everyone else also mastered the material. How angry would you be to get a C with a 98% on an assignment or in a course, knowing that it could seriously impact your overall grade point average, and knowing that you mastered the material? This happened to me in law school. The professor was great. He gave us straightforward assignments that made sense and were not tricks or traps. We essentially had to find the right forms on the online legal databases, fill them out properly, and and incorporate all the information from our mock client correctly. It wasn‚Äôt exactly monkey work, but it wasn‚Äôt difficult, because the professor showed us how to do it well. But the course had more than 18 people in it, so by school policy, it was on a mandatory forced curve. I had a 97% in the class, and received a B-. 97%. B minus. I raged my way down to the registrar, because this one course screwed up my GPA by three tenths of a point and almost cost me a summa cum laude. Her hands were tied. School policy. I showed her all my assignments. The lowest score was a 96%. A‚Äôs on every assignment. No dice. The registrar told me that other students in my cohort would likely face the same situation with other courses and reassured me that I‚Äôd be fine. I did manage to get that summa cum laude honor, but only by working night and day and by avoiding any mandatory forced curve class from there on out. What did I learn from that experience? Was it to work hard and be rewarded appropriately? To master the content? No. It was to monitor class sizes. Standards-based grading, properly implemented, should replace the ancient and largely useless scoring system we currently use. Standards-based grading is not a new invention, but it‚Äôs only more recently becoming a more commonplace aspect of secondary education. However, many institutions are just adjusting the old grading scale and slapping a ‚Äústandards-based‚Äù sticker on it. Instead of a 100% scale, now it‚Äôs a 4- or 5-point scale, where 3/5 is passing, which equates to‚Ä¶ lemme do the math‚Ä¶ 60%. Many of these new assessment scales don‚Äôt bother with required proficiencies, so students just have to reach a required minimum score to pass, and can still fail to learn important, critical concepts and skills and progress anyway. This is just a repackaging of the old system with new, shiny labels on it. I had to get my students to divorce the concept of a final score from their feedback entirely to get standards based grading to work. I did it one unit with colors for proficiency levels. I gave them a set of standards and told them that they had to reach green or blue in each one. I showed them what green and blue looked like, and what orange and red looked like. I gave them detailed criteria for reaching green and blue. I required green or blue in each category. I didn‚Äôt tell them what the colors meant in terms of A, B, etc. They could do projects and assignments I gave them, or they could design their own evidence of proficiency. They had to run it by me first, but I was pretty open about it. They wanted to know what an A was. I told them not to worry about it. They got nervous. I told them seriously not to worry about the letter grade. Just get to green or blue. On all of it. That was the goal. I‚Äôd make sure they got good grades in the system if they did. They read the standards. They understood the standards. They invented their own projects. They took the feedback on them seriously, and revised their projects. They self-assessed to make arguments about why they deserved green or blue. In the end, every student in that test class reached proficiency on all eight standards laid out in the curriculum for that unit. All 19 students. Every one of them. I gave them all A‚Äôs. I was told I could‚Äôt run that unit that way again, because parents didn‚Äôt understand it. They couldn‚Äôt figure out how to calculate the grade. The A seemed arbitrary to them. I pointed out that the students had all reached proficiency or mastery on every standard. Didn‚Äôt matter. I couldn‚Äôt justify a percentage, as far as the administration and parents were concerned. And that‚Äôs all anyone cared about. Absolutely, the American system of grading is not just flawed, but utterly broken.

Learn about room acoustics. You can‚Äôt adequately judge what your hearing until the space you are listening in sounds halfway decent. Learn about mic placement, it really matters. Moving the mic a few inches this way or that can change everything. Learn about gain staging. This means having the amount of signal at the optimal level at each stage of the recording process. For example, if the input gain of a mic is too much it will sound distorted. If it is too low it will sound noisy and weak. Learn about the art of arrangement and mixing.

Let‚Äôs also assume the government says ‚Äúturn your SBR‚Äôs in by such and such a date‚Äù and you fail to comply because you live in one of these states vowed not to enforce new federal gun controls. What happens? The local sheriff, who is bound by state law not to enforce the fed law isn‚Äôt coming to your house to serve a federal warrant or collect your firearm. I doubt they would even send a letter. So if the feds really want your SBR, they‚Äôre going to have to come and take it. So let‚Äôs assume they do. Let‚Äôs assume they send an agent to your door to arrest you and seize your SBR. I speculate the following: If you know what is about to go down, best thing you can do is call the local police. Do everything in your power to keep from being arrested by the feds, stay out of their vehicles, and resist until authorities show up. When the locals arrive they can now fight it out with the feds. The feds are serving a warrant that your state does not recognize as legal. Either the local cops are going to be able to scoot the feds along, or they are going to capitulate with the feds and you‚Äôre going to prison until this all gets sorted out. My guess as to what will actually happen? Nothing. The feds aren‚Äôt going to go door to door collecting firearms; they aren‚Äôt going to go door to door to enforce new laws. Locals have home-court advantage with this respect. At most, if you happen to get stopped by a fed (yeah right, last time I was stopped by the FBI was, oh, never) and you have your SBR on you then they will add illegal possession to the list of other charges and confiscate the weapon. Federal law only has teeth because locals enforce it. There aren‚Äôt enough federal agents to enforce federal laws throughout these United States."},{"prompt":"What is the most ridiculous ‚Äúallergy‚Äù or ‚Äúdietary requirements‚Äù a customer has claimed to have while ordering food?","completion":"After a decade in culinary I got a few‚Ä¶ A woman who was lactose-intolerant but demanded to have the cheesecake.A man claiming to be allergic to Elk meat at a plated set-menu dinner so he could be the only one eating a regular steak.A woman who was allergic to nuts, seafood, nitrates, dairy, gluten, eggs, soy, pollen, and was a vegan used to come in every week and have us custom make a dish every time.A woman who claimed to have Celiacs disease, but was caught filling up her purse with bread rolls(she knew they weren‚Äôt gluten-free) before she left."},{"prompt":"Do female users get harassed for the questions and answers they post on Quora?","completion":"I do not, or at least very rarely do. At first I thought this was simply due to not being well-known, but more and more I see that women take a lot of shit on this site, whether they have a hundred followers or 10K. I am not sure why I seem to be more or less immune from it. It might be that I just don't notice. Or it might be that I don't react enough to make it worth it. If it were in person, I could understand it - several people close to me have said I carry the scent of danger, and it takes a particularly stupid or insane person to fuck with a girl who will bite and claw like she's got nothing to lose - but online, that is less evident, and there are other women who have far sharper tongues and wits than mine. My immunity baffles me, to be frank. I hear about all the bullshit that women put up with - and see plenty of screenshots of it - and I feel both thankful and a little guilty that I am rarely touched by any of it. Edit: A third option occurs to me, which is the possibility that my Quoran ex made it known at some point that I was his. If this is the case, I never heard anything about it - as far as I know, he never told anyone about us, and I certainly never did - nor can I see him caring enough to want to protect me, particularly after we were no longer together. Still, the lack of harassment sometimes makes me wonder.

Over the course of 36 years. The funny things about photos or a cultivated image is that they only show a split second of an instant. They don‚Äôt show what‚Äôs really happening. And if you look at the narrative of the reality in the photo or of the image you present to the world enough, you may prefer that. You may prefer the illusion, the game face and the image to the messy person and process behind the photos. To find authenticity you may have to shatter your photographs or your image of yourself or one you‚Äôre holding up for others and make a mess. To rip through beautiful images completely to shreds and then reconstruct them with scotch tape and see what‚Äôs left. And then take new photos. Or none. But see clearly. I did that this year and this is what I understand. I didn‚Äôt use real tape. But I do see now that parts of what I photographed over years was me, and that part of me chose the illusion, the image that people found pleasing , over and over again and did not want to look critically any harder or to ask questions about who I was. I was afraid to lose things, to lose face, and to lose myself. I lost all of that but it was worth it. These were some of my photos over the last 2‚Äì6 years: I looked happy and I was. But there were things wrong below the surface. When those things surfaced or betrayed me, I looked away. When I couldn‚Äôt look away, the floor fell away and I was devastated. I lived this way right until I became physically devastatingly sick. I misdirected all the problems. I clung to joy. I didn‚Äôt make room for sadness or betrayal or anger or grief or fear or disappointment or dissatisfaction or feeling insufficient . I was constantly hiding while I was showing small parts of myself that looked right to me. It was cumbersome and I was handicapped by the effort long before I was ever physically disabled. I didn‚Äôt allow myself to own who I was or my feelings. Not the complicated ones. The ugly ones. The ones that made me look bad. Or feel bad about how I seemed. Right before I became devastatingly Ill, my weight spiked. It only began to drop as I started to become symptomatic. It didn‚Äôt matter how little I ate or exercised. The numbers went up to numbers that were stratospheric for me. I hated myself. My pain free functioning body. I don‚Äôt understand the way I thought then now. Then I spent almost a year in pain, incapacitated. Everything I did was its own unique torture. I was a circumstantial prisoner in my home. I missed the sunlight but it hurt my eyes. I was often isolated with my own thoughts. My trips out were to therapy and doctors appointments. I started to write. I got to know myself. I ripped it all to pieces. I let go of hundreds of relationships that were meaningless, or meaningful and bad. I had never noticed that they were empty. What it looked like didn‚Äôt matter any more. What it looked like stopped mattering as much as what it was. What it was stopped mattering as much as what it ought to be I kept the things that had been real. The things that were never only an image. I‚Äôve learned to like myself. As I am. That is no small thing in a year like mine. I am braver. I know who I am. I‚Äôm not afraid to say. I stand up for what I believe. I‚Äôm not afraid to take a risk to have integrity. I do take photos. I‚Äôm trained as a visual artist. I did digital self portraits for years. I take lots of photos. But they‚Äôre only photos. They don‚Äôt mean anything. The effort happens in my real life. I know a great photo doesn‚Äôt mean I have a great life. I make that happen by working really, really hard despite obstacles and hardship.

There were a number of angry looks from the locals when we stopped there when driving to LA. When we stopped for gas there the gas station owner told us that we should not be in this town after dark. It was quite surprising as this town is a main stop for gas and food before going over the mountains to drive to LA. We got our gas and quickly got out of there. That was about 5 years ago.

She shouldn‚Äôt have been there in the first place, and it is also not allowed to place men and women in jail together. She talked to him about what happened to her.

Here Elvis takes a bluegrass standard, ‚ÄúBlue Moon of Kentucky‚Äù, changes it to 4/4 time and interprets it like a gospel song. So, on Elvis‚Äô very first single he turns a blues classic into a hillbilly/rockabilly rave up and a bluegrass standard into a Black gospel song.

Elvis Presley absorbed the prevalent musical styles of early 1950‚Äôs Memphis and the wider region.

A 12-man jury is sent to begin deliberations in the first-degree murder trial of an 18-year-old man accused in the stabbing death of his father, where a guilty verdict means an automatic death sentence. The case appears to be open-and-shut: The defendant has a weak alibi; a knife he claimed to have lost is found at the murder scene; and several witnesses either heard screaming, saw the killing or the boy fleeing the scene. Eleven of the jurors immediately vote guilty; only Juror No. 8 (Mr. Davis) casts a not guilty vote. At first Mr. Davis bases his vote more so for the sake of discussion; after all, the jurors must believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. As the deliberations unfold, the story quickly becomes a study of the jurors' complex personalities (which range from wise, bright and empathetic to arrogant, prejudiced and merciless), preconceptions, backgrounds and interactions. That provides the backdrop to Mr. Davis' attempts in convincing the other jurors that a \\"not guilty\\" verdict might be appropriate.

DNL is Differential Non-linearity. Here‚Äôs a Wikipedia article about this: [LINKED_TEXT: Differential nonlinearity - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Demonstrates A. Differential Linearity where a change in the input produces a corresponding change in output and B. Differential Non-linearity, where the relationship is not directly linear Differential nonlinearity (acronym DNL ) is a commonly used measure of performance in digital-to-analog (DAC) and analog-to-digital (ADC) converters. It is a term describing the deviation between two analog values corresponding to adjacent input digital values. It is an important specification for measuring error in a digital-to-analog converter (DAC); the accuracy of a DAC is mainly determined by this specification. Ideally, any two adjacent digital codes correspond to output analog voltages that are exactly one Least Significant Bit (LSB) apart. Differential non-linearity is a measure of the worst-case deviation from the ideal 1 LSB step. For example, a DAC with a 1.5 LSB output change for a 1 LSB digital code change exhibits 1‚ÅÑ2 LSB differential non-linearity. Differential non-linearity may be expressed in fractional bits or as a percentage of full scale. A differential non-linearity greater than 1 LSB may lead to a non- monotonic transfer function in a DAC. [1] It is also known as a missing code . Differential linearity refers to a constant relation between the change in the output and input. For transducers if a change in the input produces a uniform step change in the output the transducer possess differential linearity. Differential linearity is desirable and is inherent to a system such as a single-slope analog-to-digital converter used in nuclear instrumentation . Formula [ edit ] DNL(i) = V out ( i + 1 ) ‚àí V out ( i ) ideal LSB step width ‚àí 1 {displaystyle {text{DNL(i)}}={{V_{text{out}}(i+1)-V_{text{out}}(i)} over {text{ideal LSB step width}}}-1} Effects of DNL [ edit ] If the DNL of an ADC is smaller than -1, missing codes appear in the transfer function, i.e. there are codes for which there is no input voltage to get the code at the ADC output. If the DNL of a DAC is bigger than 1, the transfer function of the DAC becomes non-monotonic . A non-monotonic DAC is especially not desired in closed-loop control application as it may cause stability problems, i.e. it may cause oscillations. See also [ edit ] References [ edit ] External links [ edit ]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_nonlinearity] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_nonlinearity]Missing codes are related to DNL, as mentioned in the above article. In my experience, there is a difference however-missing codes for an ADC are tested with a high-slew-rate AC signal, rather than just at DC. There was an excellent HP product note on this topic, 5180A-2; sadly it appears to not be available online."},{"prompt":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","completion":"Competitive programming is a sport-like activity where participants solve algorithmic and coding problems in a time-pressured environment.

Both have similar speeds yet the M2 type is way more expensive.","completion":"I think that you are getting things a bit confused here. SATA and M.2 are types of physical connections to a motherboard for storage devices. SATA connected drives use the SATA protocol to communicate with a controller. Storage connected via the M.2 connector can either use the SATA protocol to communicate with a SATA controller or use NVMe to interface with the computer via PCIe. Drives connecting to the computer via a SATA controller have a maximum bandwidth of 6 gigabits per second when connected via the SATA III protocol. This bandwidth limitation applies to all storage whether it is using a m.2 slot or a SATA cable. In practice, a SATA III drive is limited to around 545 megabytes per second of actual bandwidth. SSDs using the SATA III protocol are generally around the same price no matter which format the drive is using (SATA or M.2). Drives connecting to the computer via a NVMe interface are limited to the bandwidth provided by the PCIe lanes in use. SSD drives like the Samsung 9x0 series and Intel‚Äôs 660p series use up to 4 lanes of PCIe gen 3 to achieve up to 3.94 gigabytes per second of bandwidth. In practice the NVMe drives generally max out at around 3.7 gigabytes per second if the SSD controller can handle it. NVMe drives are usually around twice the price per gigabyte compared to SATA SSDs. In other words, SATA III SSDs are roughly the same price whether they use a SATA connection or a M.2 connection and are capable of the same performance using either connection. NVMe drives use PCIe lanes to provide a lot more bandwidth and performance compared to SATA III SSDs but are more expensive per gigabyte."},{"prompt":"What song has the lyrics someone left the cake out in the rain?","completion":"Mac Arthur Park by Donna Summer"},{"prompt":"My mom says cigarette smoke can reprogram cells in your airways, causing COPD to hang on after smoking ends.

That's why it's getting colder the higher you go in the atmosphere; the air becomes thinner and thinner, less molecules are hitting you and you feel it becomes colder and colder. In space there is vacuum.

An intellectual property attorney can advise on how much needs to be changed, and then, you can get a fresh copyright and new ISBN directly from Bowker. When one deals with vanity presses such as Author House, it is too easy to let them provide such numbers and therefore too easy to give up rights. An hour or so with a good attorney can save thousands of dollars. So can an indepth study of the book, Writers Market. If you care enough to write a book, take the extra steps to make it the best you can. Or print a copy for yourself on Create Space and get onto something else.

Definitely not a Danish person. Nowhere in the original book does it mention that the Little Mermaid is of Danish descent, Danish origin, that any of her kind even ever set foot on danish soil before she did. She lives in the water. Not on any land. Never set foot on the land of any nation or human culture until partway through the book, so to say she is part of that culture of human s is a bad joke at best. The Prince I believe is meant to be Danish, though in 1989 they removed any defined nation that he might be from out of the cartoon, but did give him and his assistant Danish names. But of course because this isn‚Äôt about culture, it‚Äôs about melanin, the same thing racism usually is. In 1989 Disney: Gave the little mermaid a name, a Hebrew name of Ariel. Gave the girls father a Greek name. Gave the Sea Witch a Latin name not popular in northern Europe outside of England. Made her formerly blonde hair (at times pictured dark brown early on) red (the 1989 version was written by a person with Irish heritage). Made another human looking character with blue skin (a skin color not associated with Danish 19th century people). Changed the entire story from Danish to English Changed the location to the Caribbean. (remind me when this crosses the ‚Äúappropriation of the Danish culture‚Äù line by the writer/directors who weren‚Äôt dark skinned). Removed 5 sisters. Took away her Grandmother. Made her silver scales blue/green. Took away her subservience to her father and the prince as would be more common and expected in 19th century Denmark and made her much more rebellious. Completely rewrote her transformation. Completely removed the heart and theme of the written story about mermaids not having Souls. Gave her singing and talking sea creature friends. All this done by an Irish Catholic born and raised in Chicago (but don‚Äôt worry, his tan was not very pronounced). But guess where the ‚Äúis this appropriation‚Äù comes from? Not a word there, but the skin color being a few shades darker than some people believe it should be due to increased melanin production in the actress's body portraying the fictional sea creature which has ZERO danish descent noted in the book or the original cartoon. So the pro-white supremacist/nationalist groups of 4chan and 8chan and other bilges of the internet got going and of course it spread among their allies and here we are. Nothing about all those changes made but one triggers them. I wonder why the ‚ÄúIOTBW‚Äù groups that people like former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke have supported are actively upset here. If only we could figure this out (sarcasm). And thus we have all the false narratives, red herrings and other logical fallacies trying to say ANYTHING but where this started and grew from. You can‚Äôt make up just how dumb racism is when you actually look at it. Imagine if they made a Ghost which is described as white and with human characteristics in a light brown color instead of white like Casper. Or Pinnochio described as being of red pine instead of white pine. The melanin required to be a sea creature. This is the kind of things white supremacists get upset about in their echo chambers and blame people about ghosts, sea creatures and wooden puppet colors."},{"prompt":"it okay as a beginner guitar player to skip chord F?","completion":"The F major chord is like a ‚Äòright of passage‚Äô for most beginner guitar players, so don‚Äôt feel too badly, it is a difficult chord to play at first, but you know if you keep practicing, and just persist it will come to you at last (I hear a song there).

The Armenian state was the first to adopt Christianity as its official state religion in 301 A.D, even before the Axumites in modern-day Ethiopia. The Armenians have a tradition of building stone ‚ÄúKhachkars‚Äù with intricate designs of crosses & Christian symbolism, many that continue to stand today are more then 1,000 years old. The Armenian Apostolic Church is considered to be a part of what it means to be an Armenian. Much so that the rituals of baptism and the holy eucharist are seen as integral parts of Armenian culture. Most importantly, the church has long served as a stronghold and refuge for the Armenian people who‚Äôve found themselves in the middle of competing empires over the last 2‚Äì3 centuries. After the Armenian genocide, the Catholicos (Patriarch) of the Armenian Apostolic Church canonized all 1.5 million victims as saints of the church. Today, the Armenian Church is estimated to have the largest number of saints on the planet, even more than the Catholic Church. While the Armenian state today is officially secular, the church is considered the most trustworthy organization in Armenia.

One such example is when Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, invested 5 billion in Goldman Sachs in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis. At the time, many investors were fleeing the financial sector, and Goldman Sachs was facing significant challenges. Buffett recognized that Goldman Sachs was a well-run company that would likely survive the crisis and emerge stronger. He negotiated favorable terms for the investment, including a 10% dividend and the option to buy 5 billion worth of Goldman Sachs stock at a discounted price. The investment not only provided Goldman Sachs with much-needed capital, but it also generated significant returns for Berkshire Hathaway. The investment turned out to be a shrewd move, as Goldman Sachs' stock price rebounded, and Berkshire Hathaway ultimately realized a profit of more than 3 billion. Another example of a shrewd business maneuver is the way that Apple has successfully transitioned from a computer company to a consumer electronics company. In the early 2000s, Apple was struggling and was losing market share in the computer industry. However, under the leadership of Steve Jobs, Apple recognized the potential of the emerging market for consumer electronics and began developing innovative products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Apple's focus on design, usability, and innovation helped it to create a loyal customer base and establish itself as a leader in the consumer electronics market. Overall, these examples demonstrate the importance of shrewd and smart business maneuvers in achieving success in the business world. Successful business leaders are often able to identify opportunities where others see only challenges and are willing to take calculated risks to achieve their goals."},{"prompt":"What percentage of commercial airline pilots could have had the same successful landing as the crew of the Boeing 777 United Airlines flight 328?","completion":"Any pilot who holds a U.S. or Canadian or EASA ATP or ATPL would have had no problem."},{"prompt":"w do you open a zip file on a Mac?","completion":"To quickly unzip/open a zip file on a MacWindowsLinuxÔºåhere are a few options for online extraction toolsÔºö 1„ÄÅWinZip Online: WinZip offers an online version of their popular file compression and extraction software.

It contains countless galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial objects.Empty Space: Despite its vastness, outer space is mostly empty. In the vast expanse between celestial objects, there are extremely low densities of particles, resulting in a near-vacuum environment.Extreme Temperatures: Space experiences extreme temperatures. In some areas, such as deep space, temperatures can drop to near absolute zero (-273.15 degrees Celsius), while in close proximity to stars or other energetic sources, temperatures can reach millions of degrees Celsius.Cosmic Microwave Background: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a faint radiation present throughout the universe. It is the remnants of the hot, dense early universe, and its discovery provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.Black Holes: Black holes are regions in space with extremely strong gravitational forces that prevent anything, including light, from escaping their grasp. They form from the remnants of massive stars that collapse under their own gravity.Time Dilation: The concept of time dilation states that time runs slower in regions with intense gravitational fields or high velocities. This phenomenon has been observed and confirmed through experiments and observations of fast-moving objects and objects near massive bodies.Cosmic Expansion: The universe is expanding, with galaxies moving away from each other. This expansion was discovered through observations of distant galaxies and is believed to have started with the Big Bang.The Speed of Light: Light travels at a staggering speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (186,282 miles per second). This means that light from distant stars and galaxies takes a significant amount of time to reach us, allowing us to observe the universe as it was in the past.Exoplanets: Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Since the first confirmed discovery in 1992, thousands of exoplanets have been identified. They vary in size, composition, and distance from their host stars, raising intriguing possibilities for the existence of habitable worlds.Space Debris: Earth's orbit is cluttered with debris from old satellites, spent rocket stages, and other fragments. This space debris poses a significant challenge for space missions and can potentially collide with operational satellites.Astronomical Units: Astronomical units (AU) are commonly used to measure distances within our solar system. One AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, approximately 150 million kilometers (93 million miles).The Multiverse Hypothesis: The multiverse hypothesis suggests that our universe may be one of many universes that exist, each with its unique physical laws and properties. While still speculative, this idea is being explored by physicists and cosmologists."},{"prompt":"w can I transfer ownership?","completion":"Transfers from most registrars usually take at least five days.

The most important step in making a decision on whether to find an investor or fund a business yourself through creative bootstrapping is to write a business plan that includes thorough research and a professional analysis of your personal financial condition (an accountant is very helpful here). If your start up vision is viable, and if you are fully committed, this decision will become clear to you. Then review all your financing options and there are many. None are perfect, there are always risks.

Do you think it makes a big difference if you get Coke or Pepsi?","completion":"YES - it makes a big difference to the person ordering! I personally don‚Äôt care for Diet Pepsi, and prefer Diet Coke. I always appreciate it when a server asks, ‚ÄúWe have Pepsi, is that ok?‚Äù Then I‚Äôll decline and get something different. It‚Äôs like asking for a scotch and getting vodka instead. Yes, it‚Äôs alcohol, but no, it does NOT taste the same! I had a friend who worked for Pepsi and was posted to a high-level marketing position in Atlanta. (In Atlanta, because Coca-Cola has their worldwide headquarters here and are HUGE philanthropists in the community, that deserves combat pay!) When we would go out to eat, he would be VERY particular about the vodka, because he wanted the brand that‚Äôs under the Pepsi umbrella. We always laughed a bit, because occasionally the server would say, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have that, we have (blah, blah, blah), would you like one of those?‚Äù Then the poor server would get a mini-lecture on how they should carry the Pepsi brand. Never mind that the restaurant served Coca-Cola products. In Atlanta. Literally, in the shadow of the world headquarters and across the street from The World of Coke. There‚Äôs a popular story in Atlanta that Emory University (who has STRONG financial ties to the Coca-Cola founders) once had a contractor who was building a large, new building on campus. For his workers, he arranged for a drink machine to be installed for their use. The supplier brought in a Pepsi machine and installed it. Less than 24 hours later, they were un-installing it, after the Powers That Be at Emory explained the facts of life to the contractor ‚Äî no way were they going to have a Pepsi machine on that campus, period."},{"prompt":"What do you think about the new Marvel comics characters Safespace, Snowflake, Trailblazer, B Negative and Screentime from ‚ÄúThe New Warriors?‚Äù","completion":"I don‚Äôt want to say anything yet.

Finally, there‚Äôs the preparation he made right before the battle, recording that message for Pepper and Morgan, half expecting that he might not survive the final battle. I can‚Äôt believe that Tony, as impulsive as he could be, would reflect so heavily on altering the fundamental understanding of the universe, or risk his own life or that of his family‚Äôs, just to get revenge on Steve for something he had no direct involvement in.

Their active/sleep regime looks more regular. Otherwise, they rest a lot on the week-ends. This is the key difference between the two types.ENTJs have Fi for inferior function which means they seldom talk how they really feel or they may underestimate the personal impact of their actions on others.INTJs have Se as inferior function that can result in getting overloaded with factual data, detailed information, getting engaged in sensual pleasures or caught up in outbursts of anger/childish rebells. Inferior function comes into play under stress. So, if you are more likely to never talk how you really feel under stress and you run around like an Energizer until you run out of your energy - you are ENTJ. If, you have more or less regular sleep habits because your body needs to, and under stress you are more likely to eat couple pizzas or burst into anger, you are INTJ.

While the Rigveda basically centers around divinities like Indra and Agni, other Vedic texts like the Yajurveda, Atharvaveda, and Brahmanas notice gods related with perspectives ascribed to Lord Shiva. Rudra, for instance, is a god associated with obliteration and mending, and later developed into Lord Shiva in Hindu folklore.

Sadly, there are folks like that in my own family.

Or should I spend all four days in Lisbon?","completion":"4 days in Lisbon gives you an idea of the city. But although Lisbon is a medium sized European capital, most of your exploring will be done by foot. Remember that Lisbon is a very hilly city, so it will take up much more of your time when compared to a similar sized but flat city. You will also take more time to rest and have s drink or two while you‚Äôre at it. It is after all the reason you‚Äôre here! You‚Äôll have very little time to explore the surroundings of Lisbon, and there is plenty to see there. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend at all splitting your time. You could spend your 4 days in Lagos (one of my favorites in the Algarve, great beaches), and then come back to Lisbon with more time on your hands."},{"prompt":"React Native ready for production?","completion":"React Na√Øve caters mobile applications for iOS and Android and is an open-source JavaScript framework. ReactJS developers can write code for mobile applications due to the presence of an enormous JavaScript library. Why ReactJS Development? This framework was built by Facebook in early 2015. it had been introduced to make native powered by React. React native hasn‚Äôt been used just by Facebook, but also many other Tech Giants like Walmart, Wix, Microsoft, and Shopify. Following are the factors which will inspire you to use this framework for your web app or to integrate a replacement functionality in your current app. 1. Declarative interface The ideas of component-oriented architecture and declarative UI have changed the front-end development. Huge applications are being built by the frontend developers that have reduced bugs. The motive by which React works is ‚ÄúLearn once, use anywhere‚Äù. This approach has made it a necessity for its growth. Isn‚Äôt it great to leverage of these elements while creating a mobile solution? There are fewer bugs during a more controlled UI. If developers are conversant in React, they will aid the event of apps. If considered carefully, developers can reuse many codes altogether over the React renderers that has web, mobile, VR, and Unity. 2. Cross-platform Compatible Moving fast in today‚Äôs world isn't just an option for the tech companies, it's essential. thanks to enormous competition, companies are inclined to grow faster with improved stability. It is tough for one company to manage three different operating systems ‚Äì iOS, Android, and web front for a private product. it's not only costly supported its price but also can slow the product‚Äôs growth. This framework constitutes up to 95% of its code across Android and iOS. within the growing agile approach, this will be an enormous benefit. You can also share a codebase with the online of this framework. this may be discussed within the next section. 3. Highly Reliable All the primary releases of this framework, which is open-sourced, are tested on Facebook‚Äôs production apps. this is often where other companies get their motivation to form their app most updated and equipped with the newest version. To undergo an upgrade of any framework or tool isn‚Äôt easy for huge applications but when it's already tested at Facebook, other apps can pop right in with none hold or hesitation. 4. Adopted by Tech Tycoons This framework has been employed by many technology companies, aside from getting used extensively at Facebook. This comprises Microsoft that are using RN as brownfield and greenfield both the kinds of ReactJS development. Moreover, Shopify and Walmart have also used RN for his or her mobile App. Many apps are using RN in production lately . 5. Fast Progress Many features have shifted with RN. a real influence has been recorded by these features on the debugging, performance, and project management. 6. Hermes has an Improved JavaScript Runtime Hermes may be a JavaScript engine meant for RN, introduced by Facebook in mid-2019. The team that worked on Hermes worked a year long. it's not only helped to require the advantage of RN apps, but there are many other benefits yet to return . RN has faced immense criticism supported its performance on the lower-version of Android tools. ReactJS development depends on JavaScript because it may be a JavaScript-based framework. WebKit JSC which was employed by RN and after analysis, it had been considered to be a primary component within the startup process. Hermes makes the RN apps run faster and smoother because instead of compiling JavaScript on startup it precompiled JavaScript on the startup into byte code. This also reduces runtime and minimizes the APK volume. 7. Enhanced Debugging Even though this framework is popular amongst the developer community offering great experience, debugging the software has been painstakingly difficult for them. The ability to fast change the load code may be a benefit to use RN over other native app creation. Often it's known for its Hot Module exchange and fast reload but often it did not do so and annoyed many developers. But fast refresh features have removed this drawback. One of the simplest updates to RN is Flipper. It comes after the Fast Refresh and goes to vary the whole debugging system for RN apps. It also features DevTools v4 which suggests developers can include its amazing features with this framework also. 8. Lighter and straightforward to Manage There was a project haunted by the core team during this framework that pledged to chop down all the interface elements and inbuilt modules into a definite repository. Most of those pools fall into the react community. It is lightweight and straightforward to manage if it removes of these components and modules from itself. 9. Caring and helping the Community You need to always check the responsiveness of an application‚Äôs performance to scrolling, gestures, and animations. Several good modules are coming during this genre because of the React Native‚Äôs amazing community. It includes react-native reanimated, screens, Recycler ListView, and react native gesture handler to call a couple of . to form the navigation in apps smoother and improve the developer experience, navigation and native navigation are really working hard. 10. Single Solution for Several Platforms App development on React Native helps the developers to use the once written code anywhere. This code also can run on many various platforms like Android and iOS. For the implementation and execution of ReactJS, this framework utilizes Facebook‚Äôs UI library of Facebook to make simple codes. a number of the items that you simply would wish to make an excellent RN app are APIs, hybrid app design and development that focuses on native UI elements. 11. Cost and Resource Efficient This framework is popular for its scalability and adaptability . This framework provides you with a smooth experience and speed. While development it minimized the value and recouped the time by almost 70% using this framework. Still it helps you create an app without compromising quality. 12. Can Convert an internet Page into Mobile App This framework reuses code on two platforms by just updating it once. This framework is intuitive. The repository of codes that are employed by the app are often easily understood by the developer. The framework also makes identifying bugs between codebases easier. When transforming sites into an app, of these factors help the developer to save lots of time. Synopsis Hopefully, these top 12 reasons have offered you a transparent picture of what RN is and why it's such a lot used and loved by developers for creating the mobile apps. Hence, if you would like to customize your app or want to make a replacement one, hire ReactJS Development Company. it'll offer you user-friendly and seamless user-experience."},{"prompt":"What is chutiya in Hindi?","completion":"Actually chutiye means fool (bewkoof )but some people relates it to whom, who is the fond of pussy. But it is not quite correct."},{"prompt":"Which is the best car brand in the world?","completion":"The greatest cars of all time - The below list is my personal favorite, and i think it‚Äôs the best list ever. Benz Motorwagen Created in 1886 and powered by an internal combustion engine, the Motorwagen was essentially the world‚Äôs first motor car (previous automobiles were powered by steam or electricity). Only 25 were built, and the four-stroke engine that powered the early models produced less than one horsepower. Despite its meager speeds, the vehicle paved the way for the future of cars as we know them today. Waverly Electric Anyone who thinks electric cars are an invention of the twenty-first century is sorely mistaken. The Waverly Electric was produced from 1896 to 1914 and was owned by celebrities, such as Diamond Jim Brady, Willa Cather, and Thomas Edison among its owners. Marketed as a woman-friendly automobile, The Waverly was easy to start, easy to drive, and usually came with an enclosed coach body to protect long skirts from dirt and debris. Ford Model T Part of the collection at the Gateway Auto Museum, the Model T (or ‚ÄúTin Lizzy,‚Äù as Henry Ford called it) influenced every single automobile that came after it because of its groundbreaking and more cost-effective assembly-line production method. Between 1908 and 1927, 15 million models were produced. The increase of motorists as a direct result of this first affordable car led to the creation of America‚Äôs highways, gas stations, garages, and roadside motels. VW Beetle Marketed as a car that anyone could afford, the Volkswagen Beetle has been in production since 1936 and has a somewhat scandalous origin story (developed with the help of Ferdinand Porsche, the Beetle was the brainchild of Adolph Hitler, which is ironic, given it later came to be known as the ‚ÄúLove Bug. This compact car had several notable innovations that set it ahead of its time, including rear-wheel drive and a rear-mounted engine. It was also the first car to have four-wheel independent suspension. To date, more than 21 million Beetles have been built, making it one of the most produced cars in history. Cord L-29 The coolest car you‚Äôve never heard of, the Cord L-29 was the first front-wheel-drive automobile sold in America. Introduced in 1929 and featuring a radically different arrangement of the engine and transaxle assembly, the L-29 had an elegant design that elevated it above its competitors. Unfortunately, the timing of the release coincided with the stock market crash of 1929, and after a few years, the L-29 was taken out of production. You can see a sister model ‚Äì a 1936 Cord Phaeton ‚Äì on display in the museum. Ford 150 Pickup Truck Introduced in 1948 to replace car-based pickups of the early ‚Äô40s, the F150 is now in its 13th generation thanks to its durability and reliability. Refined over the decades in styling, design, bed, engine design, suspension, and platform, it has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States since 1982 and the best-selling pickup truck since 1977. Oldsmobile F-88 Throughout the ‚Äô50s, General Motors hosted auto shows that displayed fancy prototypes and concept cars. But once out of the spotlight, the vehicles were supposed to be destroyed. The Oldsmobile F-88, designed in 1952 and 1953, was one of those dream cars that wasn‚Äôt destroyed and is today considered one of the greatest expressions of automotive design to ever come from North America. Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for 3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection‚Äôs crown jewel and possibly the world‚Äôs rarest automobile. BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ‚Äô50s and early ‚Äô60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars. Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the ‚Äúpony car‚Äù class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally. The museum is home to a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT 500 Fastback, designed by the legendary car constructor and race car driver Carroll Shelby. Porsche 911 The Porsche 911 has been beloved on the racetrack and streets alike ever since it was first introduced in 1964 and is now one of the longest-standing sports cars ever. Air-cooled with an output of 130 horsepower and sophisticated rear suspension, as well as a horizontally opposed six-cylinder power plant engine, its continuous refinements over the years make it one of the most popular sports cars on the roads. In 1999, the 911 came in fifth place in the international ‚ÄúCar of the Century‚Äù competition ‚Äì behind other notables on this list, like the Ford Model T, the Volkswagen Beetle, and the BMC Mini.

What might be best for me may not be for you .. the best firearm is the one you are comfortable with , have confidence using , can effectively hit your target ..in the venue you will be using it .

I don‚Äôt know a lot about him.","completion":"His Holiness Dalai Lama is an institution in itself. The words that he speaks somehow corelates with what inner peace is all about & let me tell you this is the most relevant thing in 21st CE. I had a rough idea about how decent human he is & has won Noble peace prize which indirectly tells you how much influential he is across globe. I watched a movie 7 years in Tibet starring Brad Pitt & is a story about Austrian Hitchhiker Heinrich Harrier, after watching this movie my inclination towards His Holiness changed more positively. This movie showcases how an arrogant human being so dominant in nature or i would say selfish completely transforms when he meets His Holiness Dalai Lama. Now I know what movie portrays is actually very much different than reality but it is based on true story & somehow I felt more connected, not because of good direction, acting but because of how sober Buddhism religion is. If you see His Holiness past history, he came as refugee in India because his life was in threat in Tibet due to Chinese Communist ideology to forcibly acquire Tibet. Just think for a while about the history of Buddhism that had been cultivated across generations in Tibet & leaving all that behind & starting a new life in India‚Äôs Mcleodganj. Just think how much sacrifices His Holiness would have made. If you see selection procedure as how Dalai Lama is elected is a very opaque process. If I am right His Holiness was a son of poor farmer & got elected to seat when he was just 2 years old. At this tender age he was a spiritual deity. The amount of expectations that Tibetan community would have & resembling with Buddha‚Äôs incarnation would have never been easy for 2 year toddler. I respect him because of positivity that he radiates across people. His Holiness has some form of different charm that separates human from god.

Once the kidney was out, one of the two surgeons on the case told me to go over and watch the other surgeon prepare the kidney for the recipient. I was standing there, being careful to maintain sterile technique, when suddenly I heard a flurry of foul language that surgeon was not known for using. I looked up, his face was covered in blood and more blood was spraying from the wound. One of the ties they had put on the renal vessels had let go and the high-pressure blood flow from the renal vein was now spraying his face, his body, and what seemed like half the room. I ran back to my post, started handing off as many sponges as I could to let him try and absorb some of the blood, handed over the suction to the other surgeon who had now rejoined us, and quickly counted more sponges from the circulating nurse as well as clamps I‚Äôd never seen or heard the name of (as it was only my third day in renal). The circulating team brought in a cell saver so they could maybe suction the patient's blood into the machine and transfuse it directly back into him and the blood bank was called to send the packed cells that were on hold for him. It was just a fury of activity and noise. At one point, the surgeon called for an aorta clamp. I had five or six large clamps on my table and no idea which was which since I‚Äôd never used large vessel clamps before, so I just grabbed them all and prayed the one he wanted was on top. It was. They were able to clamp the vessel, tie it off again ‚Äî this time tighter, and all was well again. It may sound like this took a long time but, in reality, from the beginning of the cursing to everything being under control was 7 to 10 minutes.

For the brain to be able to see beyond what it is hardwired to, You need to direct it to do so! Without such exclusive permission, the brain will always present to you a Probability rather than the Whole Truth. This feature of the brain to thrive on Probability, is in itself a fallacy.

You‚Äôll know what I mean if you‚Äôve ever gone into a job search/recruitment site and typed in ‚Äúbusiness analyst‚Äù. Just like the myriads of answers in this thread - the reality is there is no one standard list of responsibilities for a BA. The role and responsibilities of a business analyst will differ depending on the following factors: Organisation size: a smaller organisation, due to budget constraints, is more likely to look for an all-rounder BA - someone who can do not just ‚Äúbusiness analysis‚Äù but also be able to cover the tasks of a project manager, a data analyst, a systems/technical analyst and sometimes even a coder/developer. Compare that to a larger organisation with more budget and larger scale projects - chances are they can afford a bigger project team/s with specialist roles such as project manager, process analyst, systems analyst, data analyst, change manager etc.Complexity of scope: similar to the above point, for a project with a low complexity, chances are the client will expect a BA to be able to cover all bases whereas a more complex scope may have more budget to hire specialist roles in the project team.Organisational understanding of BA role: this refers to the level of maturity and understanding of project work in an organisation. I find that organisations who haven‚Äôt had exposure to change and project work, will have very different expectations or maybe don‚Äôt even know what expectations to have when it comes to a BA role. They can be on either end of the spectrum i.e. they either don‚Äôt know what value a BA can bring to their organisation OR they expect too much out of a BA. What that means is: Not every BA will have to ‚Äúdevelop‚Äù requirements. You‚Äôll still need to understand and work with requirements but you may not have to physically write it yourself (if there are other technical/systems analysts on the team).Not every BA is expected to know SQL, Power BI, complex modelling etc. If you work in a small - medium sized organisation, their data won‚Äôt be as big or as complex as a large organisation and so you might be able to get away with just being really good at Excel.Not every BA needs to write user stories, develop process maps, manage vendors, manage testing, deliver training etc. etc. For those starting out in the BA career, I would highly recommend looking for Junior BA positions where you can be part of a larger project team so that you can have the opportunity to learn, observe, ask questions, practice etc. If you are flying solo in your first BA role, I would encourage you to join a community or build a network who can help and support you through that initial stage when you‚Äôre still finding your feet. Trust me, what you learn from a ‚Äúcourse‚Äù will help you understand frameworks and methodologies but it won‚Äôt give you a roadmap for what you need to do when you actually land your first job as a BA."},{"prompt":"What is it like being a farmer?

Here are some common reasons why individuals are drawn to HRM: Interest in people and their development: Many individuals are naturally inclined towards understanding and working with people. They enjoy helping others, resolving conflicts, and supporting individuals in their personal and professional growth. HRM offers opportunities to work closely with employees, assisting them in their career development, and fostering a positive work environment.Passion for organizational success: HR professionals play a crucial role in shaping an organization's culture, building effective teams, and optimizing human capital. They are motivated by contributing to the success and growth of the organization through strategic HR initiatives, such as talent acquisition, performance management, and employee engagement programs.Desire for continuous learning and development: HRM is a field that is constantly evolving due to changes in employment laws, workforce demographics, and emerging HR practices. Individuals who enjoy learning, staying updated on industry trends, and adapting to new challenges find HRM appealing. HR professionals have the opportunity to develop their skills in areas such as recruitment, training and development, labor relations, and HR analytics.Advocacy for fairness and employee well-being: HRM provides an avenue for individuals who are passionate about advocating for fairness, equity, and employee well-being in the workplace. HR professionals are involved in areas such as employee relations, conflict resolution, and ensuring compliance with labor laws and regulations. They have the opportunity to create inclusive and supportive work environments that prioritize the well-being and rights of employees.Impact on organizational strategy and decision-making: HR professionals who are interested in contributing to strategic decision-making and organizational planning find HRM attractive. They have the opportunity to align HR strategies with business objectives, shape talent management strategies, and provide insights on human capital issues that can directly influence organizational success.Dynamic and diverse work experiences: HRM offers a diverse range of responsibilities and the opportunity to interact with individuals at all levels of the organization. HR professionals collaborate with different departments, handle various HR functions, and work on projects with cross-functional teams. This dynamic nature of HRM can be appealing to individuals who enjoy variety in their work experiences. Ultimately, the reasons for building a career in HRM can vary from person to person. It's important to assess your own interests, values, and aspirations to determine if a career in HRM aligns with your passion and goals. Exploring HR internships, speaking with HR professionals, and researching HR roles and responsibilities can provide further insights into the field and help you make an informed career decision."},{"prompt":"When will liberals realize that the reason Trump is so successful is because he represents everything liberals hate?","completion":"That's an interesting self-own.

Hayes] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Kelsey-L-Hayes], Quora'a doyenne of all things Planetos, in saying that they should have kept more careful track of various plot elements and character developments earlier on and not muddled or neglected so many of those, most especially that of the fall of Dany from heroine to villain. I think the common thread of all those bungled elements is an overemphasis on commercial exploitation and pandering to fans over the actual demands of the story and fidelity to (what we presume was) GRRM'a original outline. The biggest screw up was of course the heart of the saga- the Song of Ice and Fire as embodied by Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen- and the obvious requirement that Daenerys, as a supposed heroine who looked like a traditional fantasy protagonist, had to turn out to be a monster in the end. GRRM subverts tropes of traditional fantasy and sci-fi. He uses the conventions of writers of modern speculative fiction to tell stories about how people are fearful, selfish, flawed, and conflicted. And it's true, the requirements of drama and the human heart demand that we look for and receive heroes, even if they are grubby ones, but the kind of realism Martin aims for has always been about showing you what looks like a classic hero or heroine and then revealing them to be a character that is far, far from perfect <cough, sisterfuckin‚Äô, kingslayin‚Äô Jaime Lannister, cough cough>. So of course Daenerys was going to turn out to be a destroyer of innocents. Her story began perfectly for that subversion- an innocent who then inspiringly becomes a liberator of other innocents. But power and self righteousness corrupt, and there was no way GRRM wasn't going to tell that story. The producers of the show consciously chose to ignore that character arc, which, to be clear, they absolutely knew about beforehand, in favor of pandering to Dany fans. If they had begun to clearly telegraph he fall from grace, they'd have risked imperiling the streams of Twitter love, t-shirt sales, and babies who would live with the name Khaleesi their whole dang lives. They should have settled the War for the Dawn at least a season earlier. It does seem likely that this plot line will be much closer to the resolution of the struggle for the Iron Throne in the books, perhaps with Daenerys betraying Jon or his followers more directly, but it also is reasonable that the demands of TV would require a more spaced out development of the final slide of the once lauded heroine into villainy."},{"prompt":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","completion":"TechGropse is a well-known Mobile App Development Company that offers high-quality mobile app development services at a modest pace.

However, it is evident that depression rates have increased among younger generations in recent years. Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of depression in this generation: Social Media and Technology: The rise of social media and digital technology has significantly impacted the lives of young people. While social media platforms offer connectivity and communication, they can also contribute to feelings of isolation, comparison, and low self-esteem. Constant exposure to carefully curated highlight reels of others' lives can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of inadequacy.Academic Pressure: The current generation faces immense academic pressure and competition. The pursuit of high grades, college admissions, and future career prospects can lead to stress, anxiety, and feelings of being overwhelmed. The pressure to excel can take a toll on mental health and contribute to the development of depressive symptoms.Economic Uncertainty: Young adults today often face economic uncertainty, including high student loan debts, difficulties finding stable employment, and concerns about financial stability. The stress and anxiety associated with financial pressures can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and depression.Increased Awareness and Diagnosis: There has been a positive shift in mental health awareness, leading to more open discussions and reduced stigma surrounding depression. As a result, more individuals are seeking help and receiving accurate diagnoses. The increased prevalence of diagnosed cases may contribute to the perception of higher depression rates in this generation.Changing Social Dynamics: Changes in family structures, community engagement, and social support systems have influenced the mental health landscape. Fragmented family dynamics, increased urbanization, and a sense of disconnection from traditional support systems can contribute to feelings of loneliness and depression. It is important to note that while these factors may contribute to the higher prevalence of depression, each individual's experience is unique. Depression is a complex condition with various biological, psychological, and environmental factors at play. Addressing the issue requires a comprehensive approach that focuses on mental health education, access to quality mental health care, and supportive environments. Encouraging open conversations about mental health, providing resources and support systems, and promoting self-care and resilience-building strategies can help mitigate the impact of depression on this generation. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, it is essential to seek professional help. Qualified mental health professionals can provide the necessary support, treatment options, and coping strategies to navigate the challenges and promote overall well-being. Remember, you are not alone, and there is help available to support you through your journey towards mental health and happiness.

It is often used to evaluate the performance of regression models. To calculate the MAE, you can follow these steps: Collect your dataset: Make sure you have a set of actual values (ground truth) and their corresponding predicted values. For example, you might have a set of actual housing prices and their corresponding predicted prices.Calculate the absolute error: For each data point, subtract the predicted value from the actual value, and take the absolute value of the difference. This will give you the absolute error for each data point.Absolute Error = |Actual Value - Predicted Value|Compute the average: Take the average of all the absolute errors calculated in the previous step. You can do this by summing up all the absolute errors and dividing the sum by the total number of data points.MAE = (1/n) * Œ£(Absolute Error)Where n is the total number of data points in your dataset.Interpret the result: The MAE value represents the average magnitude of the errors in your predictions. It is measured in the same units as the original data. A lower MAE indicates better model performance, as it means the predicted values are closer to the actual values on average. Note: The MAE does not consider the direction of the errors, meaning it treats overpredictions and underpredictions equally. If you want to give more weight to larger errors, you might consider using other metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE)."},{"prompt":"w can a piece of paper folded 103 times be larger than the observable universe?","completion":"It is not possible with 103 folds but yes with 104 folds it is possible Let me do a quick calculation..

Aloe vera gel is a natural moisturizer that is known to have many benefits for the skin, including soothing sunburns, reducing inflammation, and helping to heal wounds. However, it's important to be aware that some people may be allergic to aloe vera gel or may experience skin irritation from using it. It's always a good idea to do a patch test on a small area of skin before applying aloe vera gel all over your face, especially if you have sensitive skin or a history of allergic reactions. Additionally, if you have oily or acne-prone skin, applying aloe vera gel overnight may not be the best option as it could clog your pores and worsen your acne. In these cases, it's best to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional to find the best products and skincare routine for your skin type. In summary, aloe vera gel is generally safe for overnight use on the face, but it's important to be aware of potential allergies or skin sensitivities, and to consider your skin type and individual skincare needs before using it."},{"prompt":"Why would anyone need a gun with more than 10 rounds for concealed carry?","completion":"Crooks and thugs run in packs, like wolves.

Why don't the UK people be less racist and welcome Meghan Markle?","completion":"You cannot change culture overnight, even if people are forced to act differently or keep their feelings to themselves. Many are mistaken that a hundred or two hundred years is a very long time, which it is in terms of technology, but it's only a handful of generations whereby values and beliefs are passed on effortlessly by parents to children. Knowing Britain in various regions and different family classes, Victorian and in some places medieval cultural values are still very present. Values developed based on Empire and relations to various ethnic groups around the world are still very much at large. Society is made from its history. Meghan has contradicted historic trends. Someone with her appearance and parentage would be illegal in some places in the United States before the mid-60s, if not scorned and to have any kind of status would enter the history books as an anomaly. To be married to a Royal family member is downright shocking to a Victorian or a pre-2010 mindset! It wouldn't be possible perhaps if it wasn't for trendsetters like rebellious Diana and Kate the commoner. Though the late Queen and Crown approved Meghan and Harry‚Äôs marriage, many others are not comfortable with the idea. Many are fuming! I've never witnessed such hate towards any one person in my life in Britain. Meghan hasn't done anything wrong but her haters say she's ‚Äònot a nice person‚Äô and there is a whole book or two saying how so. I'm absolutely amazed at some answers, questions and anti-Meghan spaces here on Quora. So much talent for spite, nasty implications and hateful imagination. I think what disturbs me about the British-Meghan-haters is they try to sound reasonable, justifiable, factual, sincerely disappointed, were generously open arms initially, took time to find out what she was really like and of course not as good as Kate, unlike Kate for example, we give everyone a chance and judge people on the character. I would dare to say, that when Meghan-Haters first learned of her and saw the very early pictures of the couple together; they instantly ignited and blew up in red mist as the green-eyed monster of envy. When they saw she wasn't going to apologise for her existence and not be forever grovelling because of her relatively lowly and foreign station and forever flattering the perfect people of Britain and being overwhelmed by the most tolerant and non-racist people on the planet who are often too nice for their good. Maybe they wanted her to treat her black heritage like an unfortunate disease, never mention it and be forever grateful no one else doesn't remind her of it either, like an elephant in the palace. Harry and Meghan both know that there are fans and accepting people of Britain, but also know the media, establishment, and hating cowardly crowds with nothing else better to do and would rather have Prince Andrew for tea than Meghan. Although all said is obvious to many, people are still perplexed and upset that the couple with children, don't want to visit the UK. Protecting two very young children from Britain is a full-time job in itself. How will Meghan and Harry tell their children about his family and their blood relatives, that they have used the vile press against them and there are populations to be avoided at all costs because they say, ‚ÄòMeghan is not a nice person?!‚Äô If Shakespeare was around today he wouldn't have written Romeo and Juliette. Here is a story exposing more vile elements of human nature. He missed his opportunity. Perhaps aspects of Othello and Hamlet and the witches of Macbeth could all be rolled into this play.

I am not sure about the price but based on my conversations with those who lived and eaten those meals, I guess they were just a few rupees making restaurant food affordable to all citizens across the nation! This mentality of not having to tolerate hungry citizens in itself is worth appreciation and I admire Indira Gandhi for the same. In the same note, Jayalalitha introduced Amma restaurants/canteen where affordably priced food was made available at a time when eating outside is not an option for many. Jayalalitha deserves the admiration for institutionalizing what Indira did back then. Fast forward to now, Amma canteens are shut down or are supplying to local restaurants such that Amma restaurant employees‚Äô daily job is to transport the entire kitchen output to local restaurants and spending the rest of the day marking multiple bills to account for the same being sold to many citizens! To be fair, nobody even remembers ‚ÄòJanata Meals‚Äô now! Both Indira Gandhi and Jayalalitha are equally strong when it came to intolerance of citizens‚Äô hunger. Indira Gandhi took strong steps to bring down the khalistan movement and the golden temple hostage situation had to be dealt with deadly force. Indira Gandhi knew that move would make the Sikhs hate her guts but she did it anyway as her intolerance for violation of constitution on that scale superseded all of her other political passions, however unfair they may be. When Operation BlueStar ended, her advisors asked her to replace the Sikh security guards and she boldly denied it, trusting them! That in my view, makes Indira Gandhi many folds stronger than Jayalalitha! Jayalalitha was paranoid about people trying to kill her. She spent a good amount of her adult life walking around with a bullet-proof vest and odd-looking cloak/coat to cover that up. One news of someone trying to poison her and she had them removed from her home/party etc! Her concern for her own safety is her right but the way she responded makes her weaker than Indira Gandhi! Jayalalitha wasn‚Äôt entirely wrong about her suspicion of those around her but she did not brave the storm as Indira who had the guts to take the risk and trust her Sikh security guards. Strong leadership comes with strong levels of trust in self and others irrespective of prognostic knowledge of risks. Indira beats Jayalalitha left right and center.

Here are some of the differences between the two natural stones. 1. Granite originates from the solidification and cooling of magma deep within the earth. It solidifies throughout millions of years and is classified as an igneous rock because of its origin from the cooling down of molten magma. During the process of heating and then slow cooling, granite forms as an exceedingly hard material. Granite for kitchen countertops: Granite is naturally quite sturdy and hard which makes it ideal for kitchen countertops. So if you place a heavy utensil or a hot pot on top, it will not result in damage. 2. Marble originates from sedimentary rocks. These rocks are formed from sediments in the earth combined with buried plant life under the earth over a long period. Marbles are metamorphosed into marble under intense heat and pressure. During this process, other minerals incorporate into the marble that can give the latter varying attractive colours. Marble for kitchen countertops is a famous choice. Marble adds an expensive and royal feel to kitchen designs. However, it is less durable than granite as marble is a softer stone.

Pros of buying marrow notes: 1) Ready-made notes 2) Made by a professional institute, so has to be proof read and an integration of different ideas. 3) Handwriting like handwritten notes 4) Main points highlighted with red and green. 5) Integration of tables and flowcharts for required topics. 6) Image based notes, with illustrations and pictures to support the notes. 7) Time saving 8) Easier to understand and watch the videos while referring to the notes. 9) Workspaces for adding our own additional points. 10) Important headings have time stamps, so can refer to the video at those times for later revision, without watching the whole video. 11) Difficult subjects for us, can be simplified at times with help of notes. Cons of buying marrow notes: 1) Will have to shell out money. 2) No touch of personalisation to notes. 3) Can feel like a textbook due to printed material. 4) May have to read the notes multiple times for better retainment. 5) Format of notes may not be to our liking, so hard to relate and understand. Now having discussed the pros and cons of both the situations, Let‚Äôs try to arrive at an integrated solution. I personally feel that if you can afford it, it‚Äôs best to buy the marrow notes and then watch the videos for maximum output for the following reasons: 1) We can use highlighters and highlight points of our choice and jot down additional points beside the printed text. This saves time and we can personalize the notes. 2) In places where we feel like we have a better way of noting down points, there is enough space beside the notes for us to write it down the way we want. 3) You can ask, how is this different from a textbook? Marrow notes are concise with only important and relevant examination points, so it‚Äôs much more time saving than textbooks and much easier to understand and they also have corresponding videos. In case it‚Äôs expensive to buy the notes, you can start preparing them from 2nd year itself, as the earlier you start better, as time isn‚Äôt on our side. So, I would say that only if affordability is an issue, don‚Äôt buy the marrow notes. Otherwise, all the other cons can be addressed by adding our personal touch to the notes. It‚Äôs time and effort saving and can also replicate the feel and retainment of topics just as handwritten notes. Do you need it in second year itself? Getting a good head start in the race to preparation is always good, so earlier better. Hopefully this was useful in helping you decide. All the best with your preparation."},{"prompt":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

Manmohan Singh‚Äôs Government was responding to the specific circumstances then. India faced a severe forex crisis in 1991 due to the liberalization of imports started in mid 1980s (and the borrowings from other countries by Indians who were importing these items). That has led to the liberalization of exports and also the removal license Raj. However he could not implement many other institutional reforms. Then the UPA governments headed by him increased the allocation for social sector. That was also determined by the circumstances then - coalition government; deepening of democracy; the awareness that more investments are needed in social sector; the influence of social activists and so on. One can say that Manmohan Singh was responding reasonably well to the needs of his times. In fact, the corruption allegations of his times were also an outcome of the circumstances: There was corruption in India even before. However the growth of the middle-class and the openness in the economy (facilitated by Singh) made corruption a notable issue. Narendra Modi‚Äôs regime faces certain challenges: The easier ways to boost Indian economy are no longer available; structural factors have a greater role; he and officials who work with him closely think that there are magic solutions; there is not enough consultation; there is not enough pressure to meet the needs of society; some magic solutions are tried out but correct lessons are not learnt; there is not enough reflection and discussion within the party. Hence the outcomes of his policies are not remarkable. In summary, the nature of these two individuals and the different circumstances that they are in may have shaped their policies. It is important to note that Vajpayee is did reasonably well in terms of economic policies; there was a lot more focus on developing social consensus.

When I went into college, the ideas of‚Ä¶ Using satellite images to find a lost personCommunicating with ancestors beside stone age ritual monolithsPinpointing someone‚Äôs location with radio triangulation ‚Ä¶were products of lazy Hollywood plots. Probably something that would involve people pounding away on computer keyboards muttering things like ‚Äúhacking the CIA mainframe to access the Keyhole-37B satellite.‚Äù Or a bad sword-and-sorcery movie would cover the ancestors bit. But 20 years after college, all those happened to me in one day. My brother, the adventurer, went hunting in a bit of rural Florida and left the good GPS unit in the airboat. (This being before every cellphone had Google Maps.) He and his buddies promptly got lost in the weeds and weren‚Äôt able to see the canal where they‚Äôd parked the boat. One of his buddies brought a cellphone that could report longitude and latitude in exacting detail. So, they called me. And I used their latitude and longitude on an everyday computer with everyday Google Maps and its satellite images to pinpoint their location. They‚Äôd traipse around in one direction for a while, call me with a new latitude and longitude report, and I‚Äôd verify which direction they were heading. Eventually, I got them heading to the canal and their airboat. In between those calls to the swamps of Florida, my parents called from a trip to Europe. They gave me an update on their visit to Stonehenge, standing in the middle of field far from civilization. (Sorry, Amesbury, you don‚Äôt count.) Me? I‚Äôd spent the day evaluating long-chain molecules engineered almost to the atom for their ability to armor military vehicles against hostile environments. Part of the work involved accessing much of humanity‚Äôs total knowledge, via vast libraries accessed in milliseconds through controlled pulses of light and lightning. (In other words, I was checking new paints for their corrosion resistance and trying to convince the US Army that painted metal would save them money. I had to use the internet now and then.)

Jim Butcher (author of the Harry Dresden series) has another point about the world around us that‚Äôs stuck with me for years: ‚ÄúSometimes the most remarkable things seem commonplace. I mean when you think about it jet travel is pretty freaking remarkable. You get in a plane and it defies the gravity of a entire planet by exploiting a loophole with air pressure and it flies across distances that would take months or years to cross by any means of travel that has been significant for more than a century or three. You hurtle above the Earth at enough speed to kill you instantly should you bump into something and you can only breathe because someone built you a really good tin can that seems tight enough to hold in a decent amount of air. Hundreds of millions of man-hours of work and struggle and research, blood, sweat, tears, and lives have gone into the history of air travel and it has totally revolutionized the face of our planet and societies. But get on any flight in the country and I absolutely promise you that you will find someone who in the face of all that incredible achievement will be willing to complain about the drinks.‚Äù I know the meme, I‚Äôve shared it on the FaceyTweets or InstaBooks like all the cool kids‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶but If you don‚Äôt think the world is futuristic enough, just imagine necromancing up an ancestor from, say, 200 years ago.

At the same time, you may hear reports of dropping housing starts, increased jobless claims, and shrinking economic output. But what do house building and shrinking output have to do with your portfolio? And, aside from all of these risks, how does a recession affect you as an investor? Understanding the business cycle doesn't matter much unless it improves portfolio returns. What's an investor to do during a recession? The answer depends on your situation and what type of investor you are. First, remember that a bear market does not mean there's no way to make money. Some investors take advantage of falling markets by short selling stocks, meaning they make money when share prices fall and lose money when they rise. Only sophisticated investors should use this technique. How long will the bear market or recession last? We all would love to know when the economy and regular life gets back to normal, but unfortunately, there‚Äôs just no way to tell at this point. But when this does pass, there‚Äôs a good chance that our recovery will be faster compared to other downturns given the pent-up demand from so many weeks of home isolation. It‚Äôs also likely that the longer the shutdown lasts, the slower the rebound will be. Is this a good time to invest in stock markets? The continuous price decline has presented investors buying opportunities, since they can acquire the stocks more cheaply. However, the stocks might take a longer time to recover. Therefore, if you are buying into the stocks, do it for the long term. You have indicated that there are stocks you are looking to invest in. This means that you have a watch list. Watch lists help investors monitor and spot investing opportunities in the stock market. Before buying a stock, look at its historic price performance. The price decline might be attributable to price corrections like the one we saw for banking stocks earlier in the year, after they rallied following the repeal of interest rate caps, which in turn boosted investor sentiments.Although investing in the stock market is risky, it is a good move. Even so, you should not invest your money all at once. It may be more prudent to buy the stock at every price dip because it is difficult to accurately anticipate price declines in the market. Do not try to estimate that in the coming days the prices of the stock will continue to decline. If you are an investor in the stock market, with the prices continuing to decline, you may be tempted to bail on the equities market and sell your shares. Research has shown that during the 2008‚Äì2009 financial crisis, those who held onto their shares doubled their investments after the crisis was over.

Specially helpful for 15..."},{"prompt":"Can all Glock, MP, and other similar handguns be retrofitted with external and manual safeties?","completion":"Short answer, no. They can‚Äôt. Long answer: Many of the modern crop of handguns have been engineered with safety in mind, to include Glock, S&W M&Ps, Springfield XD, and a slew of others. For comparison, I will use the 1911 series, partly for simplicity and partly because I own both a 1911 type and Springfield XDM, both in .45. The 1911 and it‚Äôs siblings, along with a good many other older styles of handguns, have their safeties engineered as a nearly separate system, to wit, the safety on a 1911 is activated by thumb lever located on the right side of the gun. It also has a strap safety built in to the grip, a passive safety of sorts that does not allow the hammer to fall unless your hand is completely on the grip, even if the manual safety is off. The safety can only be activated if the hammer is all the way back hence, what is referred to as condition 1, round in the chamber, hammer back, safety on, is the ONLY safe way to carry a 1911 with a round in the chamber. This also necessitates training to thumb the safety off as soon you draw the weapon. Doable, but it takes training‚Ä¶quite a bit of it. The Glock and its plastic relatives, however, have numerous safeties built right in to the gun. My Springfield has a grip safety, a trigger safety ( a sort of trigger with in the trigger), a round indicator, to indicate a chambered round, and a protrusion in the back of the gun that indicates that the gun is ready to be fired (round in the chamber or not). Without the grip safety depressed, the trigger will move, but disconnects the firing mechanism. Without the trigger safety, the trigger will not travel far enough back to engage the firing mechanism. The chamber indicator on the top of the gun rises when there‚Äôs a round in the chamber and can be felt by your finger. Some for the bump in the back to indicate the gun is ready to fire. The end result of all of this is that live round maybe safely carried in gun and less training is required to bring the weapon into operation. Simply pull and squeeze the trigger. As another example, the Berretta M9 used a double action/single action trigger that has a de-cocking lever which would allow the hammer to be lowered with out discharging the gun. Again, live round in the chamber, pull and squeeze. All of these weapons were engineered they way the were for a reason or group of reasons. The real question is, why would want to do this? The safeties built into modern handguns are more than adequate to the task, that being carrying live round, ready to fire at a moment‚Äôs notice, or, in come cases, with no notice at all. The only outcome of this would be to introduce unnecessary complexity and probably unreliability into a system that must be reliable, robust, and simple. The current design philosophy fits that parameter rather neatly. This does not impugn the 1911 design, just demonstrates how the design philosophies have changed and how the modern weapons are providing rugged, robust, simple, and reliable operation to anyone who needs it."},{"prompt":"What do hotels do with used soap?","completion":"Stuff burlap sacs with it and drop them down the elevator shaft to the children that are kept in the basement as laundry workers"},{"prompt":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","completion":"MacBooks are not touchscreen because Apple is focusing on indirect input with their Macs.

Rapid weight loss can be challenging to sustain and may have negative effects on your body. Instead, focus on gradual, sustainable changes to your lifestyle that promote healthy weight loss. Here are some tips to get you started: Consult a Healthcare Professional: Before starting any weight loss program, consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian. They can assess your health, provide personalized advice, and ensure you're approaching weight loss in a safe manner.Create a Calorie Deficit: Weight loss occurs when you consume fewer calories than your body burns. However, extreme calorie restriction is not recommended. Aim for a moderate calorie deficit by choosing healthier foods and reducing portion sizes.Eat a Balanced Diet: Focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid highly processed and sugary foods.Control Portion Sizes: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating. Using smaller plates can help with portion control.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger.Limit Sugary Drinks: Avoid sugary beverages like soda and fruit juices, as they can contribute to weight gain.Be Active: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Aim for a mix of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, running, or swimming) and strength training to build muscle and boost your metabolism.Get Enough Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can affect hormones related to appetite and weight gain.Manage Stress: High stress levels can lead to emotional eating. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature.Track Your Progress: Keep a journal or use a mobile app to track your food intake, exercise, and progress. This can help you stay accountable and make adjustments as needed.Avoid Fad Diets: Steer clear of fad diets that promise rapid weight loss but lack scientific evidence. They may be unsustainable and potentially harmful. Remember, healthy weight loss is a gradual process. [LINKED_TEXT: Aim for losing 1-2 pounds per week] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/283755/srikanthMalliswari/], which is considered a safe and sustainable rate.

Hulk‚Äôs also faster and more agile due to his smaller size. I think this fight really depends on how much damage Kong can take from Hulk and how many punches Hulk would need to take Kong down. Ultimately though, after his showings against Godzilla, I think Kong (2021) can take this about 60% of the time. Skull Island Kong on the other hand, only wins this about 10% of the time. Now, Hulk vs. King Kong (again) In this fight however, Kong would be lucky to survive for even 10 seconds.

Granite Have Good Stability Granite is formed under high-temperature and condensation conditions. Due to the close inlay of minerals and the extremely small inter-particle gaps, and also the multiple tectonic movements with long-term changes in the cold and heat. Therefore, the texture of granite is extremely hard and its chemical properties are extremely stable. 2.Granite Easy To Process Although granite is hard, high surface roughness and precision can be easily obtained through processes such as sawing, grinding, polishing, and cutting. Granite is unlike many metal materials that require a series of complicated forging and cold heat treatments. Therefore, the processing equipment for granite is relatively simple, the processing cycle is relatively short, and the cost of processing the finished product is relatively low. I've only mentioned a few of the benefits of granite; if you want to learn more, you can go to this website: [LINKED_TEXT: Granite: 6 Advantages of Granite You Never Know] [URL: https://www.ampquartz.com/6-advantages-of-granite/]"},{"prompt":"w do I recover Samsung Notes on a Samsung Galaxy?","completion":"In fact, the deleted photo are still stored in android phone .

Another way is to simple tag your wires as live, neutral and earth and so do it in any random manner you wish to."},{"prompt":"As an INFJ, were your enneagram results surprising to you?","completion":"As an INFJ, I was not at all surprised at my enneagram results. My enneagram type is a 4w3. It made perfect sense to me. A type 4 is one of the most common INFJ types, with the type 9 as a close second. What does surprise me though with these two typologies, is that INFJs can and do correspond with almost all nine of the enneagram types. I have encountered just about every enneagram type and INFJ combination here on Quora. So as odd and as rare that INFJs are labeled, they sure do get around. I have often wondered if this could explain why INFJs are so misunderstood and so paradoxical. This very genius comparison of the two typologies quoted by another Quora writer explains it perfectly. The enneagram explains who we are and the MBTI explains how we are. So with this theory, INFJs can be up to nine different personalities using the same ‚Äòtool kit‚Äô to express how they function. Yet each and every INFJ can relate on a very deep level and recognizes the other on that level in spite of their enneagram type. I have not found this to be the case with any other MBTI type. *A2A"},{"prompt":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"Are bank tellers allowed to ask why you are withdrawing a lot of cash from your account?","completion":"They are ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to ask any question that is not harassment.

After that check your attempts and accuracy. Then analyse the questions which went wrong and what mistakes you made by referring the solutions. Then answer the following: Are you making conceptual mistake: If yes then study the chapter again from your material and attempt 5 similar questions after that to ensure your concept is clear. If no, then check which error are you making and where. Remember this mistake so that when you attempt similar question, you consciously avoid that mistake. Attempt 5‚Äì10 questions of similar pattern by avoiding the mistake and then you‚Äôll overcome the habit.

Had an action sequence been included, then it would have felt like too much was being crammed into a single film. The pacing was good, and the scene where Darkseid sees through the boom tube after Steppenwolf dies, shows us how he understands that the complete Justice League is united and this probably isn't the best time to engage. Instead he'd come back stronger and prepared. At that moment the Justice League is in full beast mode and Darkseid wouldn't want to face an Atlantean, Kryptonian, Amazonian AND other JL members at the same time.

Only a few days old, Charlie the baby hippo was orphaned after his mother could no longer feed him. Luckily for Charlie, rescuers found him and took him to an animal orphanage in Africa, where they nursed him back to health. About a week later Makhosi the Rhino was brought to the orphanage after its mother was killed by poachers. She was very traumatised and wouldn‚Äôt settle, so they decided to put her in the pen with Charlie the Hippo. Hippo‚Äôs and Rhino‚Äôs are usually territorial and don‚Äôt normally get along. It didn‚Äôt take long for Makhosi to settle once she was in the pen with Charlie. For the first time since she arrived Makhosi was able to sleep. The Hippo and the Rhino became attached to each other which was strange because in the wild they would hate each other. Charlie followed Makhosi everywhere and even started to act like the Rhino. They did everything together, bath, eat, sleep and eventually with a Rhino for a best friend Charlie the Hippo began to believe he was a Rhino. Charlie began to hate going near the water because Makhosi would never follow him in. He would only eat when the other Rhinos ate and this was a problem, because if Charlie could never learn to be a Hippo he could never be released back into the wild. Luckily for Charlie the orphanage brought in another orphaned Hippo, a female called Moomin. It didn‚Äôt take long for Moomin to fall head over heels for Charlie and would even get upset if she saw him getting attention from some one else. The more the two Hippo‚Äôs spent together the more Charlie began acting like a Hippo. He started going back in the water and even started to eat with Moomin. Even though Charlie was a Hippo again, he didn‚Äôt forget about his friend Makhosi. They would still hang out and they still took naps under the tree together. In early 2021, Makhosi was transferred to a game reserve with another Rhino that she got close to, where they started their transition back into the wild. Charlie and Moomin where released back into the wild in February of this year, they had spent 6 years together at the orphanage."},{"prompt":"What should writers know?","completion":"The first thing you need to know is that it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt write every day or if other standard writing advice doesn‚Äôt work for you. Writing is not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing. Different people have different methods, and as long as you meet your writing goals, it‚Äôs all good. Writing also isn‚Äôt something that you can do or master quickly, though. Sometimes aspiring authors have this idea that they just have to sit down, churn out a draft, correct the grammar, and they‚Äôre ready to publish. Most of the time, it doesn‚Äôt work that way. There are days where you‚Äôre not going to know what to write or what happens next in your story (if you‚Äôre writing fiction), and after you get a draft done, you‚Äôre probably going to need to do major edits to get it ready to show the world. I encourage everyone who is a fiction writer to read Libbie Hawker‚Äôs Take Off The Pants. It‚Äôs an amazing guide to creating character driven stories that will be compelling to readers. The title comes from the idea of ‚ÄúPantsers‚Äù, who are writers who write by the seat of their pants rather than writing an outline in advance. Either planning in advance or not is fine. Most of my clients are pantsers, but if you‚Äôre a plotter, go for it! Keep in mind that writing is a business, too. Publishing companies make decisions about what to publish based on what they think will be best for their business. If you indie publish, you‚Äôll be making a lot of business decisions and will need to do marketing and advertising to get people to buy your books. (You also need to do some marketing if you are traditionally published. Query letters to agents are basically marketing letters selling yourself as a writer, and once the book is published, you shouldn‚Äôt just rely on whatever marketing the publishing company does or doesn‚Äôt do.) I also advise against expecting overnight success because it generally doesn‚Äôt work that way. Be prepared in advance for it to take time to make money writing so that you don‚Äôt get frustrated and quit prematurely. And finally, make sure to have fun along the way! Even if you‚Äôre dealing with heavy subjects in your writing, approaching the project shouldn‚Äôt be gloom and doom. You could pick up any hobby or embark on any other career, so if you‚Äôre choosing this one, it should be fun for you."},{"prompt":"What are some short stories about wives?","completion":"I learned this a bit late in life but this really helps.Learn phonetics.

I mean, people has been complaining that Marvel has been too ‚Äúwoke‚Äù in the second half of this decade. But, Marvel has always been the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù comic book publisher. I preferred DC as a kid back then, just like most other people. Yeah, what you guys experience now is entirely new thing. [LINKED_TEXT: Marvel Comics at 80: From bankruptcy to billions] [URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49865896] It is extremely funny seeing people paying a lot of tributes to the great Marvel franchise, feeling as if Stan Lee has always been appreciated for his entire life. Well, we almost send his publisher to bankruptcy back then. DC were killing it, partly because of their more ‚Äúmature‚Äù and ‚Äúlive-actionable‚Äù characters, particularly Batman. DC characters are conveniently set. Bruce Wayne is rich guy with some personality, principed enough to be predictable and not too involved in stupid things. Clark Kent has a more than comfortable career as a journalist. In the era before social media, people kept their personal miseries in their own padlocked diary books. Now, they all laid it bare to everyone in social media. We know that a journalist career is not as convenient as the one shown in Superman comics or cartoon. DC has all the popularity currency to give their silly superheroes their silly superpowers. But then there is Marvel with their edgy ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù characters that reminded us with real everyday nagging problems. I mean Peter Parker's stint in journalism under J. Jonah Jameson feels much more real, his everyday struggle with his life feels real too, his relationship with MJ, I can't stand it as a kid, seeking for a dependable adult role model. Then, the other popular Marvel franchise at the time is the X-Men. Another troubled group of people, unreasonably discriminated against. Charles Xavier is such a noble guy, but he was rarely rewarded with respect, eternal peace, or ‚Äúlive happily ever after‚Äù for his effort. That alone is disturbing fantasy. Magneto, who represented our justified rage kept being portrayed as the bad guy. You are also being made uncomfortable with the fact that you are the humans in that story. So, it is quite immersive and depressing at the same time. Marvel is too woke for me, I want to be like the three wise monkeys at this point towards real world problems. However, I don't deny, that all of these ‚Äúwoke‚Äùness, are accompanied by intelligent writing, sensibility, depth, complexity, and immersion. The latest incarnation of ‚ÄúNew Warriors‚Äù simply don't have all of this. The redflag is with the background story of this character: I mean fecking ‚Äúinternet gas‚Äù. Avengers were hardly popular back then, because of Pym Particle being a convenient plot device. He is also conveniently excluded from the original Avengers in MCU. But internet gas is certainly the new level of laziness. I get it that this character's main appeal is immersion. You can definitely relate to this meme-bingeing kid, but in the era of instant Google search facts and Wikipedia quick study (which is also part of this hero's ability), internet gas sounds utterly stupid. Good luck on relying on the internet as your primary source of super power, lest you turn into this: [LINKED_TEXT: Twitter taught Microsoft‚Äôs friendly AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day] [URL: https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist] OK, shallow background story, what's next? Oh, a Doraemon-esque superhero. Instead of magic pocket containing endless supplies of futuristic gadgetry, she has a magic backpack, which is less convenient for quick retrieval of items. I can see how this is being useful when you go against the likes of MCU Thanos or Dormamu, let alone Galactus. Anyway, her speciality stops at that other than being a blatant token representation of her identity: plus sized (quite a health risk there) and Native American ancestry. You got to wait to make her character more interesting. At least Kamala Khan, the Ms. Marvel is edgy, woke, and interesting at the same time. They never have to advertise her as our ‚ÄúMuslim‚Äù superhero. The name is simply ‚ÄúMs. Marvel‚Äù. Her ability doesn't necessarily reflect her ethnicity or religious belief. But ‚ÄúTrailblazer‚Äù is basically nothing more than her identity. She is the ‚Äúin your face‚Äù ethnicity tropes and stereotypes of a character. That is admittedly edgy, but intelligent it is not. It reeks laziness. I don't think that even in the future, this will age gracefully as the older Marvel franchise did, this is simply silly. At least Pet Avengers are fun and meme-able, this ‚ÄúNew Warriors‚Äù is quite possibly offensive. It sounds like the author is trying to sarcastically celebrating these characters' identity, especially when you consider their names. I mean, like hippies, they started as an identity, but it didn't go on well as time passes, I think this whole ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù would pass on as another silly social movement chapter in our history. While the older ‚Äúwoke‚Äù Marvel themes may become relevant these days, due to their serious take on the topics, the discussion that the character went through, it feels as if the authors went through something real in the real life. This new ‚Äúwoke‚Äù movement felt forced, like the author has no idea what it is like out there being marginalised and practically inexist from larger social conversation. The cartoonish take at social commentary, felt more like a joke than a serious discussion at best. We will move on towards better acceptance, while get rid of the extreme novelties. Throughout the time, Marvel has released a lot of failed comic series, I think this one is clearly destined to be one of them."},{"prompt":"‚Äôm moving with my cats from a very stressful home, & they use their cat trees for comfort now.

The best way to decide if taking the SAT, ACT, or both tests is right for you is to take a timed full-length practice test of each type. Since the content and style of the SAT and ACT are very similar, factors like how you handle time pressure and what types of questions you find most challenging can help you determine which test is a better fit. Most colleges require either the SAT or ACT and express no preference for either test. That said, significant percentages of students at selective colleges are submitting scores from both tests when they apply.

Web proxy is an intermediary between Web users and online resources. By directly accessing the website, you will submit a web request containing information about you (server or PC in use, your location, fingerprint of your browser, IP address, etc.). In response to the data sent, Web resources provide you with the content you requested. Unlike direct connections between users and websites, proxy-based connections provide a gateway for your web requests and the data you will receive from the website. The proxy server can hide or modify the data of your web request, and filter the content of the website to prevent it from obtaining unwanted information. This also guarantees you anonymous web browsing and data collection. How does it work? Every time you visit a website by clicking a link or manually entering a URL in a browser, you will create and send a web request, which will be forwarded to the proxy server. Then, the proxy server will modify and encrypt your data (such as Internet Protocol (IP) address) and send it to the web resource. After that, the website sends your data to the proxy server that processes the data, and then transmits the information from the website to you. In this way, it can be used as a firewall or web filter so that you only get the information you want to receive. Now that you have understood \`\`How do proxy servers work?

Chickens are, by far, my least favorite conventional farm animal. Chickens are filthy, mean and phenomenally stupid.

They also can‚Äôt be allowed near lightbulbs. If they get cold, they will set themselves on fire. They practice cannibalism on the weak. They eat their own feces, which they produce copiously. They are, however, tasty. Goats are like cats but more formidable. They have wildly varying personalities and are not particularly interested in changing for your comfort. If your goat decides they like the top of your garage, you are going to have to have an engineering degree to keep them off of it.

To be eligible for a domain transfer, you must work with your current domain registrar for at least 60 days, as ICANN operates a 60-day change of registrant lock. 1. Make sure your domain is eligible for transfer. According to ICANN regulations, if you created or transferred your domain name within the last 60 days, it is not eligible for transfer. Calculate before making the conversion to make sure you don't waste time. 2. Update your contact information. The registrar you are leaving and your new DNS registrar will need to contact you during the transfer. Therefore, your contact details must be up to date. 3. Configure your email sending domain. Your domain registrar usually provides email services related to your domain name. This allows you to send emails to and from addresses like [LINKED_TEXT: you@yoursite.com] [URL: mailto:you@yoursite.com] and can help you grow your business. When you forward to another registrar, these email accounts are often disabled, potentially disqualifying you. Make sure you have a backup email address ready to use before you begin the transfer process so you can receive important communications. 4. Unlock your domain name. Look for the \\"unlock domain\\" option in your domain registrar's control panel. Each provider is different, but you'll likely find them under the \\"Domain\\" or \\"Security\\" section of the main account screen. Domains are locked by default to prevent accidental modification or deletion. Depending on your current provider, you may be able to unlock your domain with a single click, or you may need to request a manual unlock directly from your domain registrar. 5. Request an authorization code. To transfer domains, you need an authorization code (also known as a Credential, Credential or Credential Token). This code protects your domain from being transferred by an unauthorized party. Additionally, this code acts as a bridge between your old registrar and your new provider and must be provided within five days of your request, usually via email. Some registrars allow automatic code generation directly from their control panel. 6. Create an account with your new registrar. Next, go to your new registrar and create an account. Find its transfer services page and enter the domain name you are transferring. \\"www\\" is not required - just enter your domain name and suffix (e.g. .com, .org, .info, etc.). 7. Enter the authorization code. Enter the authorization code provided by your old registrar. Check that you have entered the correct code as provided to you. If the code doesn't match, your transfer will fail and you may have to start over. 8. Domain name transfer authorization. Once you have entered the authorization code, both your old registrar and your new provider will contact you. You will be asked to confirm your details and formally approve the transfer. Make sure the contact information you provide to both registrars is accurate and be prepared to answer questions about why you're leaving your current service. 9. Pay for your domain name transfer. Now you will have to pay for your domain name transfer. Your new provider may ask you to pay for a year of service, but promotions that offer the first year free are common. 10. Complete the domain transfer. Once the domain is released by your original registrar, your new domain registrar will need time to set up your domain and servers. It usually takes a few days to a week. During this time, your website will still be accessible from your old registrar.

No, wind turbines do not run on diesel. What you might be talking about is wind farms in general. A wind farm is like any power station: it has lots of machines which run on electricity. Lights, electronics, sensors, right down to the kettle in the staff room; they all run on electricity. Obviously they‚Äôre connected to the grid, so normally they just get power from that. When they‚Äôre generating that means they obviously power themselves, when they‚Äôre not they draw power from other generators. This is the same for any type of power station, and always has been. If a wind farm has any diesel generators on site they‚Äôll be for emergency use when the grid goes down. If the grid fails all the turbines will have to stop generating because there‚Äôs nowhere to send the power. They‚Äôll feather their blades a disconnect their generators. The whole thing shuts down, but you‚Äôll still need to run things like warning lights on the turbines so that aircraft and ships don‚Äôt bump into them. Bringing power stations back online after a grid failure is called a black start and requires a certain amount of bootstrapping using backup devices such as gas turbines or diesel generators. But in ordinary operation, no wind turbines do not use diesel."},{"prompt":"Would living on the ceiling of a mined out area inside a fast rotating asteroid be more feasible than fully constructing a space colony station?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Would living on the ceiling of a mined out area inside a fast rotating asteroid be more feasible than fully constructing a space colony station?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Would-living-on-the-ceiling-of-a-mined-out-area-inside-a-fast-rotating-asteroid-be-more-feasible-than-fully-constructing-a-space-colony-station] Well . . . probably not.

The Isles of Scilly (NOT the Scilly Islands, they would get very annoyed at that) are just about 24 miles off Lands End (for Mateus, the western tip of Cornwall, although Cape Cornwall also claims to be the most western.

Home to just over 2,000 permanent BRITISH residents, these BRITISH islands are part of Cornwall for organisational reasons but maintain a separatist nature much like Cornwall seeks to separate from the UK at times! But their history as always been of the ancient Britons, attached to Cornwall, which was annexed by England, that later became part of: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That‚Äôs your answer Mateus . They are BRITISH. Now, may I ask YOU Mateus, why does Brazil wants Trindade and Martim Vaz? [LINKED_TEXT: Trindade and Martim Vaz - WikipediaArchipelago in Brazil Trindade and Martim Vaz [3] ( Portuguese : Trindade e Martim Vaz , pronounced [t…æƒ©Ààdad íi i m…ê ÅÀàt Éƒ© Ààvas] ) is an archipelago located in the South Atlantic Ocean about 1,100 kilometres (680 miles) east off the coast of the Brazilian state of Esp√≠rito Santo , of which it forms a part. The archipelago has a total area of 10.4 square kilometres (4.0 square miles) and a navy-supported research station of up to 8 persons. [2] [4] The archipelago consists of five islands and several rocks and stacks ; Trindade is the largest island, with an area of 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 square miles); about 49 kilometres (30 miles) east of it are the tiny Martim Vaz islets , with a total area of 0.3 square kilometres (30.0 hectares ). The islands are of volcanic origin and have rugged terrain. They are largely barren, except for the southern part of Trindade. They were discovered in 1502 by Portuguese explorer Est√™v√£o da Gama and stayed Portuguese until they became part of Brazil at its independence in 1822 . From 1895 to 1896, Trindade was occupied by the United Kingdom until an agreement with Brazil was reached. During the period of British occupation, Trindade was known as South Trinidad. The islands are situated some 2,100 kilometres (1,300 miles) southwest of Ascension Island and 2,550 kilometres (1,580 miles) west of Saint Helena , and the distance to the west coast of Africa is 4,270 kilometres (2,650 miles). Due the introduction of invasive species such as sheep, etc. the island's biodiversity has heavily deteriorated since the second half of the 20th century, with many indigenous species becoming endangered. [5] Geography [ edit ] The individual islands with their respective locations are given in the following: Ilha da Trindade (Portuguese for \\"Trinity Island\\") ( 20¬∞31‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥S 29¬∞19‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥W / 20.52500¬∞S 29.32500¬∞W / -20.52500; -29.32500 ) Ilhas de Martim Vaz ( 20¬∞30‚Ä≤00‚Ä≥S 28¬∞51‚Ä≤00‚Ä≥W / 20.50000¬∞S 28.85000¬∞W / -20.50000; -28.85000 ) Ilha do Norte (\\"North Island\\"), 300 metres (980 feet) north-northwest of Ilha da Racha, 75 metres (246 feet) high.

MAGA bastions like Florida and Texas also do this. Which probably makes sense. You want to make sure you‚Äôre not putting grown-ups arrested for things like child pornography or sexual assault alone in a room full of kids. When the fingerprint search triggers a result, a Do Not Hire flag is added to prevent these criminals from simply going to another state and trying again. So, one possibility is that whoever started the rumor you cite simply got confused and conflated two different threats. Another possibility is that a different ‚Äúproblem code‚Äù was added to people who refused the vaccine, as it might be for other disciplinary issues. I did some research online and the only references to this issue I could find were from the Axis of Bullshit: Fox, Daily Caller, etc. That greatly raises the odds that the story isn‚Äôt true, at least as told. Even Rep. Jim Jordan, who usually throws caution ‚Äî and facts ‚Äî to the wind with his tweets was careful to use the word ‚Äúreportedly‚Äù in posting about it, making me think he hasn‚Äôt seen any proof, either. In NYC Mayor Adams has announced that teachers fired for non-compliance are now free to reapply for their old jobs. So one thing that is certain ‚Äî and we‚Äôve known this for a while ‚Äî is that refusing to protect the health of your co-workers was grounds for dismissal in many parts of the country. And THAT, not the twisted fingerprint story, should be what we‚Äôre talking about. Let‚Äôs end with‚Ä¶ China. Where in the hell did you get that from? Just a generalized belief that all bad rumors come from Beijing?"},{"prompt":"f a submarine hit a seamount, in what ways could it be damaged that would require it to surface or return to shore?","completion":"If hit with the bow first, it would damage or destroy the forward main ballast tank, and that would comprimise boyancy. They would attempt to stabilize the ship and drive it to periscope and start blowers to maintain boyancy. If that works, they'd likely stay submerged and head back. If the felt the damage was serious and that depth control was lost, they'd emergency blow and surface, then asses damage, and head back and call for help. Any other type of side impacct would likely damage systems to the point that the ship would be ineffective in its mission and would head back submerged. I don't know enough about excess boyancy, but if they have trouble maintaining depth because of an MBT failure or flooding, it might be time to attempt to get up to the surface via power or emergency blow and make a hasty exit for most of the crew. If you're deep enough to hit a seamount, you're literally within seconds of loosing the boat if you lose boyancy or power and the boat starts to settle. Fwd and aft emergency blow swiches release air into a large valvevthat releases up to 3,000 psi into the MBTs."},{"prompt":"What are easy recipes to learn if I don't know how to cook or even prepare basic dishes?","completion":"Cooking is an essential life skill that allows us to nourish ourselves and those we love.

Those, of course, need a feeder with the same impedance as the antenna. Others are designed to drive a low impedance feed cable, to reduce losses and those will require matching (conversion) when connected to the antenna. Folding dipoles will also change the feedpoint impedance, so further complicating the design choices that must be made."},{"prompt":"What device did Professor X create to help him locate mutants?","completion":"In Marvel Comics X-Men, Professor Xavier uses a series of computers to amplify his telepathy and allow him to locate mutants.

Roman emperors had ruled from places like Milan nearer the frontiers for a long time. There was no reason for the capital to be at Rome itself, which was a long way from any threats. Also‚Äî Rome was regarded as a center of old ways and the old religions. Constantine as a new (albeit nominal) Christian, wanted to get away from that and have capital that could be both a Christian city and one without political baggage.

When the mixture is ignited, aluminum combines with oxygen in the air to form aluminum oxide, and liberates a lot of heat in the process. This heat melts the iron powder. So it is used in welding where welding rods are too small for the requirement. For example, joining two rails on a railway track by filling the gap between them using molten iron. The gap is filled with thermite and ignited.

Biodegradation: This is the process where microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae break down or degrade organic compounds into simpler, less toxic compounds. This method is commonly used to break down various types of waste, including municipal waste, industrial waste, and even specific components like plastics and hydrocarbons. By doing this, microbiology helps to reduce the amount of waste and pollution in the environment. The resulting products of biodegradation are usually water, carbon dioxide, and other simple compounds which are less harmful to the environment. 2. Bioremediation: Bioremediation is a process that uses microorganisms to remove or neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. It is often used to treat environmental issues like oil spills, heavy metal contamination, and pesticide pollution. There are two main types of bioremediation - in situ and ex situ. In situ bioremediation treats the contaminated ground in the location it is found, while ex situ involves removing the polluted soil or water to be treated elsewhere. Bioremediation is considered more environmentally friendly than other remediation techniques as it harnesses natural processes to restore the environment. These processes have several benefits including cost-effectiveness, reduction in the use of harmful chemicals, and the transformation of hazardous waste into non-toxic compounds. However, they require careful monitoring as conditions must be optimal for the microbes to carry out these processes effectively. For example, factors like temperature, pH, and the presence of necessary nutrients can all impact the effectiveness of biodegradation and bioremediation. In conclusion, microbiology offers promising, sustainable solutions to some of our most pressing environmental challenges. By harnessing the natural capabilities of microbes, we can mitigate pollution and contribute to environmental sustainability."},{"prompt":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee?

Imagine all the things that ever happened 10 years ago, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, million years ago, billion years ago. Imagine no matter how far back you go back there is always more past. Now imagine going in future, more advances in human technology, Sun dying, eventually universe dying, something else taking its place, but events keeps going on and on with no end in site. Now imagine this eternal existence is also infinitely large, or infinite number of limited universes(whatever lets you sleep soundly). Imagine all the infinite events going on at any time. Now imagine infinite events happening every instance, for all eternity. Already an eternity has passed with infinite events that happened, but infinite more events will happen in the infinite future. But still we have been seeing this like we are some fixed observer in space-time. Lets break that? Now since we are not an observer fixed in space-time.

However, your manager may be asking you to submit a resignation letter as a formality or to help protect the company's interests in some way. It is important to clarify with your manager the reason for the request for a resignation letter and to ensure that you fully understand the terms of your departure, such as any severance pay or benefits that you may be entitled to. You may also want to consult with an employment lawyer or HR representative to ensure that your rights are protected during this process."},{"prompt":"circular motion oscillatory?","completion":"in general, circular motion is not oscillatory. Walk around a circular path and there is nothing oscillatory about your motion. But there is a sense in which uniform circular motion which repeats itself is oscillatory. Consider a bicycle wheel which you can freely rotate. Put a mark on the bicycle tire and start the wheel spinning at constant angular velocity. That mark repeatedly completes the circular path in the same amount of time for each rotation. That is, it‚Äôs motion is periodic. Now just consider the just vertical position of that mark (or just the horizontal position of that mark). That is what Yubal Masalker meant when he referred to the projections of the motion. If the wheel is rotating at a uniform rate, that vertical position of the mark on the tire can be described by a sine or cosine function with respect to time. That is, the vertical component of the position of that part of the tire is a sinusoidal function of time - and hence is oscillatory."},{"prompt":"w long does it take to travel from one end of France to the other by car?","completion":"About 13 hours with comfort stops and meals.

It includes a variety of dental procedures that can be used to enhance the aesthetics of the smile, such as teeth whitening, porcelain veneers, dental implants, and orthodontic treatments like braces or clear aligners. General dentistry, on the other hand, is focused on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral health conditions such as cavities, gum disease, and tooth decay. General dentists typically provide routine dental care, including cleanings, fillings, and extractions, as well as educating patients on how to maintain good oral hygiene. While both cosmetic dentistry and general dentistry can improve the health and appearance of a patient's smile, the primary focus of cosmetic dentistry is on enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the teeth and gums, while the primary focus of general dentistry is on maintaining and improving the overall health of the mouth. It's important to note that some cosmetic dental procedures, such as porcelain veneers or dental implants, can also have functional benefits in addition to improving the appearance of the teeth."},{"prompt":"coaching really necessary for the NEET preparation? Can I join coaching in 12th standard? Wouldn't it be tough for me?","completion":"Coaching is not compulsory but recommended for students aspiring for competitive exams as coaching platforms have experienced faculties who can guide aspirants through the process of getting prepared for the exam. Self-study is sufficient for students who are well versed with the course, their pattern, etc. They can cover the concepts and syllabus from textbooks and practice with PYQs. Which is quite enough for them. However, for students who find it difficult to cover topics without the help of a mentor should go for a course provided by coaching platforms and follow it. But you should also keep in mind that the mentors are there to guide you, not do the work for you. You are responsible for your own Success or Failure. Don‚Äôt blame others later for your failure. Also, you can study simultaneously for your boards as well as for NEET. While studying for your boards, you are covering the basic fundamentals for your NEET. Without clearing your basics, you will find it difficult to cover the syllabus of NEET. So make sure your base is strong and you are good to go. You just need the right determination and motivation. Study hard and don‚Äôt lose focus. Maintain a schedule to manage your time better and keep up with it. If you need guidance from an experienced faculty, check out Misostudy. They have great courses for NEET/JEE/CBSE and their faculty members are quite experienced. You can check out their YouTube channel. They have tons of video lectures. Go through them and If you find their lectures helpful, you can head over to their website and check out the course details. You can also download PYQs and solutions from their website for free.

Beginning at the inception of the Colonies until adding Alaska as a state, the US has always had a frontier. That‚Äôs centuries of having a frontier. To hunt, to defend themselves, to enforce peace, guns were needed. There was NO other substitute, no way around it. To this day, there are lots of areas of the nation where you bag a deer to help you get thru the winter. There are areas of the nation where bears and pumas are a concern. Adequate police protection is a rather recent thing. Again, for a few centuries, you needed guns to defend yourself and your family from thieves and other marauders. The law was a couple of hours ride away. Even in cities, vast neighborhoods were lawless no man‚Äôs lands. And there‚Äôs still folks who live out on farms or up in the mountains or in unincorporated/undeveloped areas that don‚Äôt live close to law enforcement. For centuries, the Colonies and later the US did not have a standing army. Kinda stupid considering everyone else had one. The US relied on the ‚Äúcitizen soldier‚Äù. The frontiersman, the mountain man, the farmer, the store clerk. Having a gun and knowing how to shoot made you valuable to the nation‚Äôs defense. In times of need, states would form their own battalions as part of a national effort. This really wouldn‚Äôt change until World War Two. A lot of Americans pre-Civil War considered themselves citizens of their state, not the nation. As a result they were suspicious of anything that sounded like Federal authority usurping state rights. This obviously boiled to a head in the Civil War. It‚Äôs outcome left a bad taste in some people‚Äôs mouths. So to this day, they‚Äôre still suspicious and are afraid their discontent will result in their rights being abridged. This is especially true for them in regards to the Second Amendment. They‚Äôve seen all the guns in Australia rounded up. They‚Äôre aware of the rather draconian gun law in Europe. This doesn‚Äôt help the paranoid feelings. It culminates in right wingers thinking Hilary‚Äôs gonna put ‚Äôem all in FEMA death camps and left wingers thinking Trump‚Äôs gonna throw all non-whites into the gas chambers. They grip their guns a little tighter (Spoiler alert! Democrats own guns too!) Meanwhile, gun manufacturers make a LOT of money, and pay a LOT of taxes, and pay off a LOT of politicians. The NRA has a LOT of members that think someone's gonna take away their guns. They pay a LOT of dues. This hires a LOT of lobbyists to influence a LOT of politicians. So, you see, in the US, a lot of folks have real reasons for having and using them. Gun control? Forget about it. Assault weapons are a myth. the AR-15, while being a civilian version of the military‚Äôs M-16, is not an automatic weapon, it‚Äôs only .223 caliber, which is LOTS less powerful than you‚Äôre average semi-auto hunting rifle. It just looks mean. Background checks are good, but background checks in regards to terrorism have missed people and put the wrong people on no fly lists. You could ban mentally ill folks from buying a gun, but most of them are undiagnosed. You cant let race, religion, or political persuasion be a factor in denying gun ownership. See, not proud to say this, but our success is in spite of our selves. We came to be as immigrants on a wild and hostile continent. Human nature had us fighting each other and ourselves. The colonies should have failed. The Revolution should have failed. The Civil War should have finished us. But it didn‚Äôt. Everything we are, from our proudest achievements to our foulest sins, grew out of that fighting mindset we were thrust in to. It is the same story as anywhere else on Earth, but here it happened in a few hundred years, not the thousands of Europe or the tens of thousands of Asia. Despite everything, we‚Äôll hold onto our guns a little longer. Shootings and violent crime are actually down in the US, just the incidents of loud mass shootings are up. The 24 hour news networks don‚Äôt bring that fact up because they‚Äôre in the business of selling fear and division. Which sells more guns."},{"prompt":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","completion":"There are many ways to make money online without an investment in 2023.

You might read people saying ‚Äúi found purpose‚Äù, but the irony is life itself has no purpose. Life is just an event that happening in the cosmos, in an infinite number of manifestations. The same life energy which is absolute, has identified itself into multiple lives in multiple forms. In effect, the life force that exists within you, me and all the living beings are the one and the same. this life force is the only true immortal thing that exists. This life force has manifested itself into infinite lives, with different degrees of limitation. Now why it has limited itself into many forms of different capabilities? It is probably because, without this limitation there is no event or drama that can happen in life. For life to exist, drama needs to unfold. So in effect, life has constituted a design by which it can make itself take multiple forms and forget its true form. so each living being and non living being, is a manifestation of same life force.

After all, Python and R are the two most popular programming languages for machine learning, and there are many resources and libraries available for these languages. However, there are several reasons why C++ can be a great choice for learning machine learning, and in this article, we'll explore some of these reasons and provide you with tips on how to get started. Firstly, C++ is a high-performance programming language that is often used for developing fast and efficient software. This is because C++ allows for low-level access to hardware, which can be useful when working with large datasets or when developing computationally-intensive algorithms.In fact, many popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch are written in C++. Secondly, if you already have experience with C++, you may find it easier to learn machine learning in this language. This is because you are already familiar with the syntax and structure of the language, which can help you focus on learning the machine learning concepts and techniques, rather than learning a new programming language at the same time.Additionally, many machine learning algorithms can be easily implemented in C++, which can help you develop a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work. Thirdly, C++ can be a good choice for developing applications that require real-time processing, such as autonomous vehicles or robotics. In these applications, speed and efficiency are critical, and C++ can be a better choice than Python or R for achieving this. So, if you've decided to learn machine learning with C++, where should you start? Here are some tips to help you get started: Learn the basics of C++:If you're new to C++, start by learning the basics of the language, such as data types, loops, and functions.There are many resources available online, including tutorials and video courses, that can help you get started. Learn the fundamentals of machine learning:Before you can start implementing machine learning algorithms in C++, you need to understand the fundamentals of machine learning.This includes topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.Again, there are many resources available online to help you learn these concepts. Choose a machine learning library:Once you have a good understanding of the basics of C++ and machine learning, you can choose a machine learning library to work with.Some popular machine learning libraries for C++ include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.These libraries provide a wide range of tools and functions for developing machine learning applications, and there are many resources available online to help you learn how to use them. Implement machine learning algorithms:With a good understanding of C++ and machine learning, and a chosen machine learning library, you can start implementing machine learning algorithms.Start with simple algorithms like linear regression and logistic regression, and gradually work your way up to more complex algorithms like deep neural networks.As you work on implementing these algorithms, you will develop a deeper understanding of how they work and how they can be optimized for performance. Practice and experiment:As with any new skill, practice is essential for mastering machine learning with C++.Experiment with different algorithms, parameters, and data sets to see how they affect performance.This will help you develop a deeper understanding of how machine learning works and how to apply it to real-world problems. In conclusion, while Python and R are the most popular programming languages for machine learning, C++ can be a great choice for learning machine learning, especially if you already have experience with the language. C++ is a high-performance language that allows for low-level access to hardware, making it a great choice for computationally-intensive applications. That's all from my side, Thanks for scrolling!

Androids are supposed to look like humans. Robots don‚Äôt have to. But there‚Äôs another big difference. Androids are way more autonomous. Robots are generally designed for a purpose where they will do complex or repetitive tasks based on their programming. The root word for Robot after all is ‚Äúrobota‚Äù which meant ‚Äúforced labor‚Äù, either by a slave or an indentured servant. So: ‚ÄúRobocop‚Äù would be ‚ÄúSlave Cop‚Äù‚Ä¶. Androids typically have a designed function but they‚Äôre more autonomous. They make decisions for themselves and have ‚Äúoff time‚Äù pursuits. Look at C3POs adventures. They have a general assignment but go about making decisions in their own way. Also look at David, Bishop, or Ash on the Alien series. Again, general assignments‚Ä¶ but with enough programming to be able to make decisions and do things not directly related to a particular assignment.

Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"Some are, some are not. The question should be ‚ÄúIs the average education level of students who go to private schools better than the average education level of students who go to public schools?‚Äù To that I would say almost assuredly. This is not because the average curriculum and teaching ability at private schools is better. Yes, private schools usually have a smaller classroom size. This helps but the major reason is because the average family that has children attend private schools places a higher value on education. The family encourages the child to study. This is no different than a family that encourages their child to be best at sports such as baseball and football, in performance arts such as singing and instrumental music, or any other endeavor. If the child is having problems that family either helps directly or gets a specialist such as a gymnastics instructor, vocal coach, or a tutor. The child values the field and tries harder. A teacher can only do so much. Contrary to popular belief, the job of teachers is not to TEACH, it is to assist students in learning. In elementary/primary school this is mainly through repetition. They provide a lecture, which is usually short and then practice, practice, practice. The practice is no better than can be achieved through purchasing the workbooks or many programs such as provided by Highlights magazine. The difference is the mostly the analysis and correction of the students during the practice. Analysis of thought process when solving problems is why teachers for homework require students to show their work. It is not because they WANT to analyze every step. It is because they NEED to analyze each step to ensure the students know and understand what they are doing. One of the reasons I do not consider class size as important when comparing public schools and private schools is though depending on the state the the average public class size can be over 50 students per teacher in ELEMENTARY/PRIMARY school (hopefully just a class like physical education), though the vast majority are between 25‚Äì30 students per class. There are a few states such as Maine, Wyoming, and Tennessee where the average public school elementary class size is around 17 or slightly smaller than the average classroom size of a most private schools except in the area of special education."},{"prompt":"w do I buy a stock after the markets close on Upstox and Zerodha?","completion":"Thanks for A2A Neetish , Basically Buying or selling of a Stock after the market closes is reffered as After Market Order (AMO).

After the war, it was like the South had conceded, the physical fight, and began an psychological one instead. Their Southern pride took over, and they revered the men who stood up to protect ‚Äútheir way of life‚Äù.

Listening is crucial. As a non-native speaker, you will doubtlessly have learned grammar rules but native speakers break these rules frequently (often without even knowing they are doing so). The only way a non-native can learn this is to immerse themselves in English as much as possible and begin to identify when it is OK (and equally when it isn‚Äôt OK) to break grammar rules.That leads nicely into my second point. Go and live in a native-speaking country. Teachers can help you improve your pronunciation of English but to pick up an English (or American) accent, you really need to be around it every day.Get comfortable with idioms and slang. One of the worst things for a native speaker is talking to a non-native speaker who sounds like they are reading from a textbook. Native speakers will relax much more easily around a non-native speaker if that person uses everyday expressions. However, some of these expressions that you might learn from a book are now very dated. For example, no one says ‚Äúit‚Äôs raining cats and dogs‚Äù any more. We are much more likely to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs pissing down‚Äù which you would only learn from a native speaker and not from a book.Watch comedy. I mentioned above about how important listening is and in my opinion, for those wanting to sound like a native, comedy is the best type of show you can watch. Not only does comedy give you an insight into the culture of a place but it has two other big advantages. Firstly, a lot of jokes are funny because they are based on double-meanings and therefore you will learn alternate meanings of the same word or phrase. Secondly, comedy programmes are strewn with regional accents and therefore your listening and your knowledge of regional slang will improve. Finally, there is an element of luck in terms of how fast you can pick up an accent. Some people have a musical ear and therefore can mimic accents very easily. These people can often be mistaken for native speakers even if they only speak at a passable level. However, if you are not such a person, patience is the most important thing - you will need to put in a lot of work to sound like a native speaker.

May be this was the same floods that initially inundated mythical cities like Dwaraka, Atlantis etc and later over next few millennia, obliterated all traces of earlier civilisation? According to Indian scriptures called Matsya Purana, our ancestors used to live towards far South and escaped from great floods or Pralay, and settled later in the northwest parts...Could it be possible that the survivors of this event migrated to settlements at Indus valley, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Europe, introducing Sanskrit in the process?

We don't have relatives in Canada.","completion":"Whether you know someone or have relatives in Canada makes no difference. Getting jobs in Canada not likely to be possible unless both you and your brother have high level, unusual, or rare skills that cannot already be found among Canadians or Permanent Residents. Unlike some countries, Canada does not have a work permit that allows foreign nationals to come to Canada and search for a job. In order to get work permits, you must both already have valid, LMIA-approved job offers from a Canadian employer. LMIA-approved means that the employer has completed a lengthy and expensive process required to prove to a Canadian government agency that no one in Canada can fill an available job. Only then can the employer offer a job to someone outside Canada. Because Canada has a well-educated workforce and many people are now unemployed due to COVID-19, it would be very unusual for an employer not to find people in Canada to fill almost any available job. That is why I suggest the only way you‚Äôd get work permits would be if you both had unusual/rare/unique skills. You can certainly try to find jobs in Canada. If you are expert application programmers or skilled tradespeople, that might be possible. But for every other field, it is very unlikely that a Canadian employer would hire foreign workers, especially now. Many companies have their recruiting software set to screen out foreign applicants.

Berry had been sentenced to prison for robbing a bank in 1961, and he spent three years there. However, he successfully appealed this conviction, citing the disparaging comments of the judge as the basis for his conviction. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, [LINKED_TEXT: Chuck Berry] [URL: https://youtu.be/EmO3NXnjf2Y] discussed his musical influences. In one instance, he mentioned Les Paul as an influence on his playing. The guitarist even said that the song \\"How High the Moon\\" by Les Paul inspired him. In another interview, he said that \\"It was very beautiful.\\" In response to a question about the influence of Mick Jagger on Berry, he scoffed. The music business was still very different in the 1950s than it is today, and racial prejudice was a major obstacle to Chuck Berry's success. His publicity photos were deliberately underexposed in order to make his skin tone appear lighter, a tactic that often backfired. For example, a Knoxville club booked him, thinking that he was white. He was then turned away. While Chuck Berry certainly knew that Presley was a trailblazer, he felt that achievability on the scale of Presley's was his to claim. In fact, in 1958, he ranked eight songs on the Hot 100, his most successful year. Chuck Berry was a prolific songwriter and guitarist. He took his country and blues influences and turned them into a new sound. He also influenced others with his lyrics, which were a mixture of subtle critique and wit. As a result, he helped pave the way for Bob Dylan. But in terms of style and music, he and Presley were very different. Chuck Berry was a fan of Nat King Cole, and he played blues songs by Muddy Waters and Jay McShann. In fact, he sang the famous \\"Confessin' the Blues\\" at school, which was considered inappropriate for a school event. While this might have seemed like an odd choice at the time, it was a big hit, and his popularity skyrocketed. In the '50s, Chuck Berry was a recognizable stage presence and an icon. Chuck Berry was considered one of the founders of [LINKED_TEXT: rock] [URL: https://youtu.be/EmO3NXnjf2Y] and roll. His style and talent helped bring the genre into the mainstream, and many people wanted to emulate him. In fact, John Lennon said that Chuck Berry's name stands for rock and roll, and his music paved the way for the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and David Bowie, AC/DC, and so many more. Presley's music career began in the 1950s. He signed a recording contract with Sun Studios and made several hit singles. After the recording contract, Sam Phillips sold Presley's contract to RCA for 35,000, and Elvis was a big star.

Whatever vile things the pagans of old did - human sacrifices, religious persecutions, sacred wars, slavery, oppression, etc. - Christians also did, often with no less gleeful zeal. Whatever was good in pre-Christian religions - from highbrow philosophical and mystical traditions, to the simple practices of communal charity and natural spirituality - found its way into Christianity as well. The idea that the Church has moral high ground over religions which preceded it, lead to the development of new and nastier kind of antisemitism, hitherto unknown to pagan world, which found its ultimate fulfillment in gas-chambers and body-pits of Holocaust. Above: typical medieval depiction of triumphant and morally upright Church (left) vs. blind and humiliated Synagogue (right). And while Nazism definitely was not a Christian movement - indeed, it consciously emulated many of the worst aspects of old pagan religions - it is quite damning that Nazis could and did use writings of the ancient Church fathers and Christian priests, to justify their atrocities against the very people from which Christianity sprouted. And it doesn't help that a considerable number of Christians, to say the least, didn't exactly break their balls to stop them; the leadership of Catholic Church, for instance, which through history was quite trigger-happy about proclamations of holy wars, decided to remain tactfully discreet through that war - while the freaking communists, out of all the people, bleed themselves white in fighting the Nazi nightmare! Examples such as this (and I could list many more, but Godwin‚Äôs law does the trick) after almost two milenia of Christianity, really ought to melt most claims of its moral superiority into thin air of humility. Which is, of course, the finer point of Christianity. It was not a religion which claimed a moral superiority of its unique message. It was a religion which called for re-inclusion of morally questionable back into society: of outcasts, deplorables and downtrodden. Its founder famously proclaimed that He did not come to the righteous, but to the sinners, for ‚Äúit is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.‚Äù (Mark 2:17) Its earliest adherents were whores, tax collectors, infidels, lepers, criminals and soldiers of an occupying imperial army, while its detractors were priests, men of letters, pious patriots, wealthy merchants, respectable landowners and governing officials concerned solely with maintaining law and order. Its most basic wisdom constantly emphasized how everyone deserves a second chance, no matter their transgressions, how one should first ‚Äúremove the beam from his eye before plucking a speck from his brother‚Äôs eye‚Äù (Matthew 7:5), and how one should not judge others, but like God, love both the just and the sinner, for ‚ÄúHe causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.‚Äù (Matthew 5:45) And its most famous symbol is the crucifix: a device of tortuous execution, onto which - according to the fundamental Christian myth - we humans condemned God to die, because He failed to meet our high moral standards. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

It was class 9 when I met my crush, being from an average high school it was quite obvious that there would be a menace while going into the washroom (no, I did not meet her there ofcourse). She was from our senior batch and was going to appear for the ICSE boards that year and she was one heck of a student, without a doubt she was treated as an elite among her batch (this isn't a sapiosexual case either). While coming back from the washroom we almost collided but thanks to her friends that did not happen. And that's pretty much how I met with her. Soon after that I formed my research team who had the sole purpose to track down her every detail. About 3 days after I got to know her name, probable place of living and her marks(which was fu**** good!!). Then it took about 3weeks for an opportunity to spark up for me to talk with her. I was a class monitor back then and I had to call one of my teachers to attend the class luckily her class was just beside the staffroom. She was inside the staffroom (and God! I thanked him like a hundred times) probably waiting for the incharge to show up and after a moment of silence‚Ä¶. Her: Kon class tor? (Which class are you from?) Me: 9 B (shocked, utterly shocked plus stammering) A moment of silence again and then the incharge showed up and I went back to my class after informing. That was the 1st time I talked with her. 2years later 2 years later I found her out on Facebook. Texted her after the request was accepted and then got to know about the advancements she made in her career (something about 98% in ISC) and she was damn frank. So I asked her about some tips to score better and then something gooooooood happened. She said I can take her notes if I wanted since the subject combination was same in my higher secondary(thank you God, once again!) She asked for my number jumping with a happy soul I sent it to her and it was around 2:15am and she called me right away although I was not supposed to receive that. So after a day we met, unofficially for the 1st time and in totality, 2nd time. Moments later I was on her scooty's backseat. (Sources from Google) Now, those who thought that I had accomplished the unaccomplishable stuff, let me clarify it. I was on her backseat, with her note books on the way to photocopy them.

What is it made up of? Will we be able to create it?","completion":"What is dark matter? ‚Äî We don‚Äôt know. What is it made up of? ‚Äî We don‚Äôt know. Will we be able to create it? ‚Äî We don‚Äôt know. Frustrating, isn‚Äôt it. So what do we know, then? Why do we even speak of ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù? Because, to put it bluntly, our theory of gravity fails over very large distance scales. Galaxies spin too quickly yet do not fly apart. Galaxies move in clusters way too fast, yet the clusters remain intact. And cosmology tells us that the cosmos should have roughly seven times more nonrelativistic matter than what we observe. So then, the hypothesis goes, what if there is, actually, more matter and we just don‚Äôt see it? What if 80-odd percent of all matter is in a form that simply does not interact with known forms of matter, hence it is ‚Äúdark‚Äù? (More accurately, it should be called transparent matter. It‚Äôs not really ‚Äúdark‚Äù: it does not absorb light, does not cast a shadow. It behaves as though it simply wasn‚Äôt there. Transparent.) If we postulate this dark matter component, all is well. Galaxies spin the way they‚Äôre supposed to with dark matter halos surrounding them. Clusters of galaxies stay intact because of the extra gravity of dark matter holding them together. And cosmology works, too, kind of (although it requires another mystery component, dark energy). So these are strong reasons to believe that dark matter exists. But we would, of course, like to be able to confirm it through direct detection and, well, figure out what it is made of! So far, we failed. There are many theoretical proposals to explain dark matter. These have either been falsified (i.e., they predicted a way to detect dark matter which then did not pan out in experiments) or have not yet been tested (mainly because of the difficulty of devising an experiment to detect something that rarely, or never, interacts with the stuff that we are made of). For this reason, there are alternative proposals as well, such as theories of modified gravity, which attempt to do away with the dark matter concept altogether, proposing instead novel changes to Einstein‚Äôs theory of gravity. But that, too, is a very difficult path: Einstein‚Äôs theory is notoriously hard to modify without destroying its ‚Äúnice‚Äù features, and then there is the question of testing a theory through observation."},{"prompt":"Why does it appear Captain America's Vibranium shield seems almost indestructible, but in ‚ÄòBlack Panther‚Äô the Vibranium armored cars are easily destroyed?

In fact, it is theorized that a GRB is the most energy-producing phenomenon in the known universe. So in theory Superman would get much more power with a GRB than with a Quasar. A Gamma Ray Burst is when a massive star goes hypernova and two jets of ultra-concentrated stellar energy are generated. Just to give you a little idea, a Gamma Ray Burst can generate the Sun's energy a Million Trillion times in less than a second. If Superman is directly exposed to the blast of energy fired from a GRB it is as if Superman obtained the total energy of a Million Trillion Suns in less than a second, just imagine that Ultra Sundipping.

That is because the basis of Carnatic music is very different. Carnatic musicians believe in upholding the sanctity and purity of the compositions that the great saints like Thyagaraja created. So generation after generation, musicians have to a T, maintained the exact same way in which a composition has been rendered, without changing so much as a single note or glide. Hindustani in the other hand, encourages the modification and embellishment of compositions, by adding the musical expressions and interpretations of the individual artiste. While the basic underlying melodic structure of a composition might be the same, every artist is allowed to sing it differently. Musicians from certain parts of the country who were learning from each other eventually created the system of gharanas.

In his defence, he could have destroyed hulk only if hulk didn't got adrenaline rush after seeing his lady love. 14. Dormammu (Doctor Strange) If you consider yourself the ruler of dark dimension who knows in-and-out of magic and yet you got easily trapped in the infinite time loop by a sorcerer, you are not worthy to be among the top villains. 13. Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger (Iron Man) He sets the tone for the MCU villains and was the main element behind why Tony Stark became the Iron Man. Thanks for that Iron Monger. 12. Kaecilius (Doctor Strange) Villainy eye-makeup sorcerer who went rogue. He was the disciple of Dormammu who has some amazing and trippy fight scenes with Doctor Strange. 11. Ronan the Accuser (Guardians of the Galaxy) He was the purple makeup zealot whose main purpose was to destroy the Xandar using the power stone. He has the guts to stuck it up to the Thanos and walk away from him. He sure has my respect. 10. Ego, the planet (Guardians of the Galaxy 2) He was literally a God and one of the most powerful beings in Marvel. Funnily enough like the name, he has an ego problem who treats every other beings apart from the celestial beings as a resource to consume in the quest for power. 9. Helmut Zemo (Civil War) He was an average guy who wanted a revenge for the death of his family. In my opinion he is an underrated villain whose name many doesn't even know but here he sits in the top 10 of my list. He strategically plans his moves. And what better way to take revenge than to turn the Avengers against each other. 8. Vulture (Spiderman: Homecoming) The guy who takes girlfriend's angry dad to whole new level. Basically he was a street level villain who believes that technological advancements has affected his career. In his armour he looks villainous and his motive makes him a good villain. 7. Red Skull (Captain America 1) One of the most terrifying looking villain who seems like the one who had an awful experience with plastic surgery. One good thing is that he don't have to deal with nose itching. On serious note, he headed or may I say started the Hydra division. He was the only villain apart from Thanos and Loki whose story arc deals with more than one infinity stones. 6. Ultron (Avengers: Age if Ultron) He portrays how can technology and superheros can be the reason of our doom. He has the real motivation behind his apocalyptic visions (unlike many villains in this list). If only he planned his attacks properly. 5. Winter Soldier (Captain America: Winter Soldier) Yeah I know he became superhero. But he started out as manipulated Villain. His history with the Captain America makes him a perfect villain in Captain America 2. He was the centre of attention of two Captain America movies and his bridge fight scene with Captain America and Black Widow was a treat to watch. 4. Hela (Thor: Ragnarok) Oh! I love her. The most comic accurate villain alongside Thanos and Loki. The goddess of death was the perfect supervillain for Thor where the family drama works better than anywhere else. She started out easily much stronger than Thor when she breaks Mjolnir without much sweat. Cate Blanchett casts perfectly as Hela. I don't know whether I have crush on her or on Hela. Maybe both. 3. Killmonger (Black Panther) Perfect villain for the Black Panther who was the cousin of black panther. He indeed has a superhero origin instead of villain origin where his father was killed by the then Black Panther and he was denied his royal heritage. If you are rooting more for the villain than the hero, then you know how good that villain is. 2. Loki ( So many many movies, not that I'm complaining) God of mischief is fan favourite. Eventhough he became good guy but he started out as a perfect villain who wreaked havoc on so many places. Everything about him is perfect- his backstory, his motivation, tricks up his sleeves, his wit and whatnot. Tom Hiddleston was so good that Marvel kept on bringing him even after so many deaths. Let's hope they bring him back once again. As hulk would say ‚ÄúPuny God‚Äù. 1. Thanos (Infinity War/ Endgame) The ultimate baddie of MCU. His character development spans over 9 years right from the first Avengers movie. He is the hero of his own story who thinks killing half of the universe is the only way to save the universe. For that he can go to any extent like sacrificing her own daughter in order to achieve that. That's what makes him a perfect villain. Fun Fact: In comics he wanted to destroy half of the universe as a tribute to Mistress of Death in hopes of gaining her favor.

How true is this?","completion":"Did he really say this? If so, then he is even more dumb than we all assumed. If the elites want ‚Äúno more families and children‚Äù, then how are they going to staff their businesses and factories, when the current generation dies out? Who is going to buy their products and services? If women are spending their money on ‚Äútrivial things‚Äù, then that clearly doesn‚Äôt include the single parents who are buying food and clothing for their children, paying rent and taxes. If he means ‚Äútrivial things‚Äù such as skin care and make up, then I guess he must prefer women who go around with dry skin and bare faced. Hmm - actually it doesn't seem that way when we look at the kind of women he likes to associate with. And healthy skin care is a lot less trivial than his enormous ego-boosting, gas guzzling cars he wastes money on.

The line is annoying, but quite representative of a teenager unaware of his primary emotions. It reminds me of how annoyed I was with Harry Potter in the 5th book of the series. Harry has a full-blown tantrum directed at Dumbledore. It‚Äôs not pretty, it‚Äôs not rational, it‚Äôs embarrassing, but it‚Äôs realistic. We‚Äôre dealing with a teen going through a very difficult time! That is what we‚Äôre seeing in the scene with Anakin as well. Acting it out must have been challenging, and it‚Äôs quite a lot of range and emotional depth to expect from someone as inexperienced as Hayden Christensen at the time. He has been open about it being a difficult scene. I believe he did his best with what he had, and I hope and expect the new TV-series will redeem him as Anakin after years of unkind criticism. But the line makes sense: Instead of talking about the real pain - losing his mother, having broken with his own principles and ideals as a padawan, his anger against the Jedi council for not making him master, his complicated and illegal feelings for Padme - Anakin talks about something mundane that is so much easier to deal with. Anakin is not the first one to do this. It‚Äôs quite common. We get really angry about things and don‚Äôt realize that those things are actually not the things that we REALLY have a problem with. We avoid the underlying causes of our misery, because there‚Äôs no easy solution. This actually helps explain how Anakin ended up on the dark side. When we suppress primary emotions, we suffer the consequences and end up doing a lot of destructing things, such as hurting the people we actually love. His complaints about sand shows us an individual incapable of addressing real emotional problems in a healthy way."},{"prompt":"A 500 ft. train travelling 500 ft per minute must travel through a 500 ft long tunnel.

It can make even the strongest man or woman cry like a baby. But fear not, because I'm here to help you get rid of that pain once and for all. As a physical therapist, I've worked with countless patients who have experienced lower back pain. Some of them have tried every remedy under the sun, while others have never even thought about trying anything. So, let's dive in and discover some of the best ways to get rid of that pesky lower back pain! Strengthen Your Core, and I Don't Mean Apple Cores Listen, folks, your core is not just there for show. It's there to support your spine, and a strong core can do wonders for lower back pain. So, what exactly do I mean by \\"core?\\" I'm talking about the muscles that make up your abdomen, hips, and lower back. Strengthening these muscles can help take some of the pressure off your lower back, reducing pain. Now, I know what you're thinking. \\"But Eric, I hate doing sit-ups and crunches.\\" Well, fear not, because there are plenty of other exercises you can do to strengthen your core. Planks, bridges, and bird dogs are just a few examples. Don't be afraid to mix it up and try different exercises to find what works best for you. Get Moving, You Lazy Bones Sitting on your couch all day binge-watching Netflix might seem like a good idea at the time, but it's not doing your lower back any favors. You need to get up and get moving! Walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling are all great low-impact exercises that can help alleviate lower back pain. \\"But Eric, what if I can't do those exercises because of my back pain?\\" I hear you, and I have an answer for you. Water aerobics! It's a low-impact exercise that's easy on the joints and great for strengthening muscles. Plus, it's a great way to cool off on a hot day. Trust me, I've seen it work wonders for my patients. Stretch It Out, Baby Stretching is like the secret sauce to getting rid of lower back pain. It can help loosen up tight muscles and improve flexibility, which can help reduce pain. Just make sure you're doing it correctly, or you could end up doing more harm than good. One of my favorite stretches for lower back pain is the double knee-to-chest stretch. Lie on your back, bring both knees up to your chest, and hold for 10-15 seconds. Repeat for 5‚Äì10 times. It's a simple stretch that can make a big difference. And don't forget to stretch your hamstrings too, as tight hamstrings can contribute to lower back pain. Don't Be Afraid to Seek Professional Help Now, I know what you're thinking. \\"But Eric, I don't want to go to the doctor. They're going to tell me I need surgery or something.\\" I get it. Going to the doctor can be scary, but sometimes it's necessary. If your lower back pain is severe or persistent, it's time to seek professional help. As a physical therapist, I've seen firsthand the benefits of seeking professional help for lower back pain. A physical therapist can evaluate your pain and come up with a customized treatment plan that's tailored to your specific needs. Plus, they can teach you proper form and technique for exercises to ensure you're doing them correctly. Wrap It Up, Folks So there you have it, folks. Strengthen your core, get moving, stretch it out, and don't be afraid to seek professional help if needed. These are all great ways to get rid of lower back pain and improve your overall quality of life. But remember, consistency is key. You can't do a few exercises or stretches one time and expect your pain to magically disappear. You have to make a commitment to yourself to stick with it. Now, I know what some of you may be thinking. \\"But Eric, what about pain medications?\\" Look, pain medications may provide temporary relief, but they're not a long-term solution. Plus, they come with their own set of risks and side effects. I'm not saying you should never take pain medications, but they shouldn't be your go-to solution for lower back pain. Are you experiencing back pain or discomfort in your body? DO you want to stop or avoid taking costly and highly addictive pain medication? Discover my secret weapon to help countless of patients.

Here are some strategies that can help you reduce face fat: Calorie deficit: Create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn. This will contribute to overall weight loss, including fat reduction in the face.Balanced diet: Focus on a balanced and healthy diet that includes whole foods, plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid or minimize processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat foods.Hydration: Stay hydrated by drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day. Proper hydration can help improve overall skin health and reduce water retention.Cardiovascular exercise: Engage in regular aerobic exercises like running, swimming, cycling, or brisk walking to burn calories and promote overall weight loss.Facial exercises: Perform exercises that target the muscles in your face and neck to tone and strengthen them. Some examples include cheek lifts, blowing air into your cheeks, and jawline exercises. These exercises may help improve muscle definition and reduce face fat.Facial massage: Gently massaging your face with your fingertips or using a facial roller can help improve blood circulation and lymphatic drainage, which may reduce bloating and puffiness.Limit salt intake: High sodium intake can lead to water retention and bloating, which may make your face appear puffy. Reduce your consumption of salty foods and processed snacks.Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. Sufficient rest can contribute to overall well-being and may help reduce facial bloating.Avoid excessive alcohol and tobacco: Alcohol and tobacco use can contribute to facial bloating and inflammation. Reducing or eliminating these habits can have a positive impact on your overall health and facial appearance.Patience and consistency: It's important to remember that spot reduction is not possible, and fat loss occurs throughout the body as a whole.

Basically, stupid people with limited vocabulary take an aggressive stand against anybody who knows something they don't. That being the case, it is almost definitional, then. You are defined as a show-off and a jerk if you use extensive vocabulary. There is no way around a definition like this.

If they are having a few drinks or dinner with the possible new supply, they do not want your name popping up on the phone screen for their new and exciting supply to be turned off by. My narc was usually gone for around a week a month. I never found out exactly where he went although probably the worst‚ÄùNew Supply Interview Trip,‚Äù he went on was when he received the 8k to pay our mortgage arrears or face having the mortgage go to the receiver and lose it. I built the home and had it 24 years, no problems. Then my Narc decided it would be his free hotel, to come and go, with me there as support whilst he was on the long search for his new supply . 18 months he would come and go, abuse me - physically, mentally, financially, emotionally and I was isolated, not given enough money for food and he destroyed my car so that I could not travel anywhere, see my friends or family and simply go shopping. Initially I thought my Narc was travelling back from the country to our home - we chatted all night and were both excited and looking forward to seeing each other. He was due back at 11pmhowever I got a garbled message just shortly before that saying he was pulling over and having a sleep. I didn‚Äôt see him for 5 days after that.

I had a good student who was going rogue. She had ‚Äúendoftheyearitis‚Äù and among other things was refusing to wear the dress code shirt. I called home and chatted with dad. Explained the problem, that we only had a few more weeks of school left and I couldn‚Äôt see her getting in trouble over something so trivial. Could he help? He said sure. The next day, she came into my office madder than a wet cat. ‚ÄúYou!‚Äù she shouted. ‚ÄúYou got me in trouble!‚Äù She then let me know that when she got home from school the previous day, every item of clothing she owned was gone from her room, with the exception of her under clothes and her school uniforms. For the last few weeks of school, she had to wear her uniforms to school, to bed, to the pool, to the mall, to church, to her friend‚Äôs houses. Literally everywhere. Needless to say, I was dying. Her dad had told her that if she couldn‚Äôt make a smart choice with her clothing, he would take the choice away. And he did. The man should get an award. EDIT - I am getting the biggest kick out of these comments. And don‚Äôt get me wrong - I am totally not opposed to a difference of opinion. What‚Äôs cracking me up, though, is the assumption that there is some underlying ailment with this child that would provoke her to limit-test this dress code rule and that the father was a horrible human for not addressing it. Let me explain‚Ä¶no, it‚Äôs too much‚Ä¶let me sum up. The child in question was not making her choice to violate the dress-code policy based on any insufficiency in her life. She thought the rule was stupid (understandably so) and decided to break it. She understood the rule, had it within her means to follow the rule, had been warned about breaking the rule and chose to do it anyhow. Why? Because that‚Äôs what kids do. Stopping at a red light when there is no cross traffic present or coming is stupid. Doing it at 2am is even worse. Without exception, when I am sitting at that stupid red light with not a cross-traffic car in sight, I seriously consider breaking the rule and running the light. Sometimes, I act on my plan. Other times, I don‚Äôt. Either way, I understand the rule. So, it‚Äôs totally okay to disagree with this dad, but don‚Äôt do it based on the idea that the child was misinformed or that her needs were not being met. For sure, she knew exactly what she was doing. Okay, carry on!"},{"prompt":"f you shoot yourself in the chin, would the recoil crush your throat/sever your spinal cord?","completion":"No, the recoil is the least of your problems.

In general, spendthrift clauses attempt to protect beneficiaries from themselves by preventing beneficiaries from assigning away their interest in the principal, income, or both of the trust, and preventing those interests from being attached by the beneficiaries‚Äô creditors. There are obviously many factors that could influence how this issue effects you, including the exact terms of the trust and your state‚Äôs laws.

Corporations in particular don‚Äôt require a bailout in order to settle their debt. Corporations can declare bankruptcy and reorganize or just go out of business. The cost of bankruptcy is absorbed by those who took the risk of investing in the corporation, lending money to the corporation, or selling goods and services to the corporation. All would have prospered if the corporation had done well. Bailouts to corporations and in particular bailouts to banks are justified by governments as being needed in order to prevent a cascading impact on the economy. ‚ÄúToo large to fail‚Äù. They might also be justified as necessary for a strategic material. Coal would be a example in an earlier era. Or it might just be good old ‚Äúcrony capitalism‚Äù which is just a mild form of socialism in action. Nor do individuals usually need bailouts either. Individual loans are usually handled in much the same way. Individuals declare bankruptcy every day, pay what they can from their existing equity, and eliminate their debt at the cost of poor credit. Lenders typically require secured loans for large debts such as mortgages or cars. As with corporations the individual borrower can then walk away from that debt and start over. No debtors prisons here. Most conservatives I know think that both corporations and individuals are responsible for their debts and need to pay them back or declare bankruptcy in order to relieve themselves from that debt. The problem with student loans is that they were a government inspired effort to stimulate college attendance and did not follow the basic precepts of both corporate or individual loans. First, student loans did not require equity to secure the loan. Nor did they require a parent to co-sign on the loan (again providing equity security). Nor did they limit how the money would be spent. Why would banks be stupid enough to lend large sums of money with little control on how the money was to be spent nor any security in the form of equity in case the loan were to be forfeit? Why? They weren‚Äôt stupid. They had a guarantee. The government ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù the loans and the government effectively eliminated bankruptcy as a means of getting out from under massive debt. The result? Universities grew at a phenomenal rate using the influx of cash provided by student loans. That growth involved offering useless ‚Äúeducational‚Äù products that provided no economic benefit to students in the future. Tending bar or coffee shop counters doesn‚Äôt provide for paying back loans. In addition universities became bloated with unnecessary bureaucracy that essentially tripled the cost and provided no educational benefit to the student. I worked my way through school. I graduated with zero debt despite zero help from government or parents in paying for my college education. Try doing that today on minimum wage. Impossible. Adding insult to injury state legislators began reducing support to state universities and diverted the money to other programs. Universities prospered and students became buried under massive debt. Now, unlike most unsecured debt, one cannot get out from under a lifetime obligation that in some cases can never be paid back. Its debtors prison without the bars. Are the students responsible? Of course. They took out the loan and agreed to repay it. Every conservative I know would agree with that statement. That‚Äôs why the push back on loan forgiveness. I paid for my college education. I paid for my 4 children‚Äôs college education. I watched my middle class neighbors forgo paying for the children‚Äôs educations and instead had them take out student loans and the resulting debt. They used that money to fuel their own lifestyle at the expense of their children‚Äôs future. Now the government wants me to fund my neighbors bass boat and jet ski because they were too selfish and short sighted to help their children. Hard pill to swallow. Do I sympathize with the students. Damn right. They were not legally ‚Äúdefrauded‚Äù by the government and the school systems but in my opinion they were ethically defrauded by those parties. They were told from K through 12 that they needed a college degree to be successful. Student loans were easily available with no immediate commitment as to equity or cosigners or any of the normal methods of securing a loan. Seemed free at the time. Are students responsible? Damn right. Are parents, universities, banks, and the federal government responsible as well? I think so. In particular the major beneficiary of this process were the universities who spent that student loan money irresponsibly and provided a low value product in return. Bailout? How about holding some of the other parties to this student loan process accountable? How about fixing the system so that we don‚Äôt continue allowing students to incur massive debt? Lets start with no more unsecured student loans. Today. Now. Lets give student loans borrowers the capability of using bankruptcy to eliminate debt. That makes banks do their job. Banks doing their job will put pressure on universities to offer studies with economic value. Would you lend money to a student seeking a degree in low paying field who has no co-signer and no collateral and little opportunity for future earnings? OR Universities need to provide an economically valuable product at a price that the consumer can afford. Perhaps we should make the Universities co-signers or even the loan originator. It is after all the universities that have benefited the most. They need some skin in the game of student loans. Bailout? Maybe when the system is fixed the rules can be changed and allow the student loan recipients to declare bankruptcy. How that would work is unclear to me but it wouldn‚Äôt be some blanket relief to everyone. As with every bankruptcy the borrower would have to show necessity, would have to relinquish assets to pay for part of the debt, and suffer the consequences of bad credit."},{"prompt":"Why would a narcissist block you on Facebook then unblock you then block you again?","completion":"Playing games.

My definition of retirement is not having to do something you don‚Äôt enjoy for money. Like me most people who consider themselves retired still work. For me I did consulting and contracts, but it wasn‚Äôt enough so I have a more junior role I enjoy. It keeps me technically sharp and I can work anywhere. However, as I look back at everything I‚Äôve accomplished in life, that my job is low stress and I enjoy it, and that I accomplished everything I sought to do, there‚Äôs this constant feeling of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù vs. ‚Äúyou did it‚Äù!

I‚Äôm single, don‚Äôt drive many miles each year and enjoy driving a new car every three years due to all the new technology that is improved especially the safety features. Leasing has paid off for me for I live in a extremely high traffic, accident prone area. And guess what? Had 7,000 miles on a new Lexus and a girl getting off work, on her cellphone, racing through a parking lot took the entire front end off my car. Cost was 25,000. What do you think that wreck did to the trade in value of my car? With a lease, you aren‚Äôt affected by depreciation from an accident. I had a luxury car before that and bought it. Large down payment plus high monthly payments although 1% interest rate and I wasn‚Äôt ahead but couple of thousand when I traded it in three years later. Plus had a utility truck back into me slicing through right quarter panel, etc. If I had leased, I would not have been out as much. My current lease with GM and the dealership offered me total maintenance free including oil changes for entire lease period. As many do, offer new rental car while you wait for oil changes, etc. Free car wash anytime. Payment much less than buying. So, if you aren‚Äôt keeping your car long enough to outlive the depreciation, lease. If you are like me and want a new car every three years, lease. But if you drive many more than 10,000 to 12,000 miles a year, need to probably buy. Now, to explain my way of thinking. I am older. I‚Äôm from the generation you only bought and usually used. We have driven cars and almost cry when we had to get rid of them for they were like a member of the family with all their faults but funny stories later. We spent a vacation once in a service station. It was a toss of a coin it would start on cold mornings. Couldn‚Äôt run the ac in traffic or radiator would be boiling over with you looking like you‚Äôre driving a steam engine. This list goes on and on. So, I‚Äôm driving a new shiny car while I can and until I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve paid off too many cars and had nothing but maintenance issues afterwards. If I want to gamble, I‚Äôll go to Vegas. But that‚Äôs just me."},{"prompt":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","completion":"This works as a parent and grandparent: listen to your kids, and take a little time to observe them.

Should I sit in on his class for a day?","completion":"I‚Äôm answering this long after it‚Äôs been posted, but I guess I feel like I should say something. Yes, you absolutely should. The reason I say this is clear: There may be problems going on in the class that you‚Äôre unaware of. Your child may be getting bullied by the teacher and the teacher is sending these troublemaker slips home because she doesn‚Äôt like him for one reason or another. Your child might be the actual disruptive one! Or he‚Äôs fighting back against bullies and the teacher is punishing him. Or, y‚Äôknow, the teacher is racist against your kid if you‚Äôre indigenous/PoC/not white and has decided to bully and belittle him! Ohhh, there‚Äôs a story behind that one. Despite how I look, I‚Äôm a native american/indigenous person. I had a cool teacher in the beginning of kindergarten that I‚Äôll call Ms. Apple, because her cards for her students were apple shaped (as far as I can recall). About partway through the first semester or so, another kindergarten teacher was hired and Ms. Apple‚Äôs class was split in two. I‚Äôll call this second teacher Ms. Bully, because that‚Äôs what she was. They split the class down the middle by name and I was sent to Ms. Bully‚Äôs class despite multiple tries of me being put back into Ms. Apple‚Äôs class. Ms. Bully was‚Ä¶ okay, at first, as far as I can remember. I hated being in her class, though. It was just me and another girl who were singled out and bullied, and it really showed. I remember these cards my school gave to kindergarteners who helped out after lunch in the cafeteria or the like, which I‚Äôll call ‚Äúapple stickers‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt my turn to help out, as I was always skipped over on the list of helpers, but I did anyway because I wanted my teacher to be proud of me. I saw her walking down the main building‚Äôs hallway to the cafeteria and held up my apple sticker going ‚ÄúLook, Ms. Bully, I got an apple sticker!‚Äù Instead of being encouraging, I got told off for doing after-lunch cleanup when it wasn‚Äôt my turn. That hurt, honestly. I think I found myself crying about it because she told me off. I‚Äôm not sure, as it was a long time ago. Ms. Bully also set the other kids in her class against me and the other indigenous/native american girl. Whenever we played duck, duck, goose, we were the last two to be chosen, if we ever were. We were excluded from most of anything and couldn‚Äôt make friends because we were bullied so much at such a young age. I remember vividly about a chart Ms. Bully kept on her wall that she‚Äôd rotate people to do different after-lunch activities on different days. She intentionally skipped me when it was supposed to be my turn and I said so. A reasonable teacher‚Äôs response would be to apologize and correct their mistake. Not Ms. Bully. She tore the chart down and said something about me having ruined it for everyone or something like that. I cried. My mom, learning about this, was not happy. Neither was the other girl‚Äôs family. Two indigenous/native american men soon were sitting in the back of our class while Ms. Bully taught. It didn‚Äôt take long for her to finally get caught, but at that point the damage was done. I would be bullied and friendless for the majority of my school days because of the damage Ms. Bully did in that one year of teaching. It was a process, but Ms. Bully ended up being unable to teach ever again because of how she treated me and the other indigenous/native american girl. I actually never saw the indigenous/native american girl again after that year, and later learned that the school I‚Äôd gone to didn‚Äôt like letting us withdraw because they got money for letting us go and learn there. If someone had stepped in sooner, put us back in Ms. Apple‚Äôs class and stopped her earlier, none of this would happen. The icing on the cake was that we all got postcards at the end of the school year. I remember being‚Ä¶ happy I got one, but now it kind of hurts to think about because it was due to Ms. Bully that I didn‚Äôt have any friends for the rest of my K-8 life. All because she decided to be racist against two five-year-olds and entice the other kids to bully us/exclude us. So yeah, go sit in on your kid‚Äôs class. Have someone sit in on your behalf. Watch what happens, and take action before it‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs never wrong to do that, especially if it‚Äôs in the very beginning of his school life. If it‚Äôs later on, schedule a parent-teacher conference, talk to the teacher and then have a trusted friend sit in as it‚Äôll be ‚Äútoo embarrassing‚Äù for a parent to sit in on the class."},{"prompt":"Best Online Ph.D. In Computer Science | Accredited Schools Online","completion":"There are so many least expensive accredited online degree programs offered by universities across the globe.

AI has the potential to improve the accuracy of medical diagnoses, provide better customer service, and increase the efficiency of many industrial processes. AI is also advancing the fields of robotics and autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars are now a reality, thanks to AI's ability to recognize objects and respond to environmental changes. AI is being used to develop robots that can interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously, such as carrying out medical procedures or delivering products. The possibilities of AI are vast, and its potential to revolutionize the world is only beginning to be explored.

They must act to quickly remove low performing people from the team, while at the same time be on the lookout for new A players to join. 3. Documenting the vision and goals The CEO owns articulating the vision and defining measurable goals that are realistic for the team to achieve. 4. Holding the team accountable for performance When the team succeeds, the CEO should give props. When they come up short, the CEO should be clear where the failure was and help the team dissect why it happened so similar situations can be prevented in the future. The CEO is ultimately responsible for delivering results. 5. Ensuring the company has the capital needed to operate and succeed Finally, a CEO must be constantly aware of the company‚Äôs financial needs and guide the effort to raise capital or adjust expenses accordingly. If the burn is too high, the CEO must dictate lower budgets or reduced resources to stabilize the company."},{"prompt":"Which do you prefer, dubbed movies or subtitled movies?","completion":"Dubbed.

I am literally perplexed.","completion":"Choosing the best college for an integrated course in ACCA with BCom can be a difficult decision, and it is ultimately up to your individual preferences and priorities. However, here are some factors to consider when comparing Manipal University Jaipur and GCEC Global Foundation Jaipur: 1. Reputation and Accreditation: Both Manipal University Jaipur and GCEC Global Foundation Jaipur are recognized and accredited institutions. Manipal University is a well-established university with a good reputation for providing quality education, while GCEC Global Foundation Jaipur is a newer institution that has been gaining recognition in recent years. 2. Course Curriculum: It is important to compare the course curriculum of the two institutions to determine which one better aligns with your interests and career goals. Look at the course structure, course content, and teaching methodology to determine which one will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need. 3. Faculty: The quality of the faculty can greatly impact your learning experience. Research the qualifications and experience of the faculty members at each institution to see which one has a more experienced and knowledgeable faculty team. 4. Campus Facilities: The facilities and resources available on campus can greatly impact your learning experience. Look at the infrastructure, library, computer labs, and other facilities available at each institution to determine which one provides better resources for students. 5.

Determine which one has a better track record of placing students in top companies and organizations. Ultimately, it is important to visit both institutions, talk to current students and alumni, and gather as much information as possible before making a decision."},{"prompt":"w do homeless people survive?","completion":"Many will eventually accept help and go to a warming shelter, some churches will render aid and numerous non-profits will help with winter clothing.

So this year i gave my 12 class exams and after that i was left with around 40 day's for neet , i started revision again, and gave almost all test in Aakash , but days passed my studying hours decrease ( reasons are like fear of 12 results , getting less marks in my Aakash test, but this was because i was comparing my performance with a drop student who got almost 670+ in all test and ended up getting 690 in neet with 12 air ) so this was continued till 2 or 3 may till 12 class result came out , i was felling normal cause i didn't got less but also didn't got a lot so after this relative's call u and that stuff happened so the day came of neet exam , and the same day i calculated my marks so i was getting around 490 - 500 , so i was like this is end of 2 year hardwork , and i have to study all again, i cried a lot that day ( but i was surprised that my father said that he was happy because he was expecting only 400 from me) The day results came i was in Gujarat and was well prepared for a rank under 30k in worst case but i checked my result and it was 505 with 46k rank , i was like what 46k , i was sure that i won't get college this year but didn't expected this rank , but that is what it is , But i think i was a fool who studied biology's those chapter which were important like genetics, human reproduction ( i literally did 2 extra books excluding Aakash module), but only 3‚Äì4 questions came in exam from genetic from which expected questions are about 7‚Äì8 , So i can say i did mistake of studying less in last few days but thus was a paper which made horse and donkeys equal ( ghadha ghoda ek barabar ) i am not saying topper didn't study or those who study do not deserve what they get , but by setting a good paper will have made it easier to get the actual one's out but , but i think what happens, happens for a reason So i am preparing for 2020 and expecting a good paper at least this time Suggestions are welcomed"},{"prompt":"My mom refuses to give my dad my passport and other documents.

Cryptography is more of a research-oriented job whereas cyber expert is an industry-oriented job. If you are ready to crunch maths and develop world-classes crypto algorithms then you should opt for cryptography but if you want to do penetration testing and security audits of systems, if you love breaking into systems by finding loopholes more than you love maths, a cyber expert should be your forte.

This means that the body becomes efficient at using fat for fuel, which can help to reduce hunger and cravings between meals.Intermittent fasting: Some people who eat only once or twice a day practice intermittent fasting, which involves abstaining from food for a certain period of time. This can help to regulate hunger hormones and increase feelings of fullness between meals.Eating nutrient-dense foods: People who eat only one or two meals a day may prioritize eating foods that are high in nutrients and low in empty calories, such as vegetables, fruits, lean protein, and healthy fats. These foods can provide sustained energy and help to keep hunger at bay.Mindful eating: People who eat only one or two meals a day may practice mindful eating, which involves paying attention to hunger and fullness cues and eating slowly and deliberately. This can help to reduce overeating and prevent feelings of hunger between meals.Habituation: Eating only once or twice a day can become a habit over time, and the body may adjust to this eating pattern. Over time, the body may become accustomed to fewer meals and not feel as hungry between them. It's worth noting that not everyone will be able to adjust to eating one or two meals a day, and it's important to listen to your body and eat when you're hungry. It's also important to prioritize nutrient-dense foods and to make sure you're getting enough calories and nutrients to support your body's needs."},{"prompt":"What's your favourite British myth or legend?","completion":"Reading through the answers, I'm surprised nobody has mentioned her yet.

And I have the reasons, but first let's see my state preference list. 1)SCB medical college, Cuttack2)MKCG mch, Berhampur3)VIMSAR, Burla4) SJMCH, puri5) FM mch, Balasore So I will be getting scb medical college(the best gmc of odisha) easily in first round. And I love it. Also as a matter of fact, it's going to be India's largest hospital by 2024. So why I didn't register in aiq 1st round? I Won't be getting anything better than scb medical college. I could have got aiims Kalyani and some lower aiims, but I don't find it good to be leaving it. At a point I was inclined towards aiims k but now I find scb better. Also it is set to become better and having state quota is better than the aiims roster system. Also scb is in the heart of cuttack, So city life Won't be a problem.

Trailblazer‚Äôs backpack. As soon as I heard this, I recognized it. It‚Äôs just a slightly cursed version of‚Ä¶ Heward‚Äôs Handy Haversack: A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic fee tin volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even great-er power in addition. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fum-bling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.-Dungeon‚Äôs and Dragons Dungeon Master‚Äôs Guide, 3.5 Edition, p259 It‚Äôs just a larger capacity, glitchy recovery Heward‚Äôs Haversack.

There‚Äôs no implication that the ‚Äúpocket dimension‚Äù is tied to her specifically, and not the backpack itself. She‚Äôs a wanna-be Sherpa.

Cartoons are stylized, painting monochromatic is stylized, exaggerating shadows or light is stylizing, etc. Style is a particular way of making art that tends to have something of a signature effect. Abstract is a style in which the art does not represent actual things that exist in the real world, but instead uses shapes, lines, and colors for their own sakes. Here‚Äôs an example of something stylized: As you know, humans do not come in shades of blue, orange, and purple naturally, nor are they naturally defined through brush strokes. These are all stylistic elements brought in by the artist, but the artist still made the effort to create something recognizable: a woman‚Äôs face. Here‚Äôs an example of something abstract: Notice how you can‚Äôt actually pick out any objects from the real world out from this painting. It is literally just colors and shapes on a canvas, made largely for aesthetics‚Äô sake rather than to represent anything. This is the essence of abstract; if they ask you to parse out a very specific meaning from an abstract art piece (like ‚ÄúThis represents how the artist felt after her divorce‚Äù or something like that), they‚Äôre playing a prank on you."},{"prompt":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","completion":"No. I would have left her the minute I found out she was advertising her extra-marital affairs on social media."},{"prompt":"What is ‡§§‡§æ‡§ú‡§Æ‡§π‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§®‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç?","completion":"Agra"},{"prompt":"Why has India ended up as such a corrupt country, while the USA, being another democratic country, has such an organized and lawabiding government in comparison with India?","completion":"'Merica has much Less Population sharing much more resources - from Land Area, Petroleum and other natural resources'Merica has a more homogeneous LanguagePurpose of the existence - America is preparing for the next war, while Indians are having a good time while on earth :-)Scars of British occupation.

It‚Äôs important to understand what‚Äôs causing your pain and be proactive in treating it. There are a number of different ways to reduce and eliminate lower back pain. First, you should check with your doctor about the cause of your pain. They can determine if it‚Äôs a muscle strain, herniated disc, arthritis, or something else, and provide the best treatment option. Your doctor may recommend medication, physical therapy, or surgery depending on the cause and severity of your pain. Second, you should improve your posture. Many people experience back pain due to poor posture, such as slouching or sitting for long periods of time. Make sure that you maintain the correct posture when standing, sitting, or sleeping. It‚Äôs also important to stretch and exercise regularly to increase strength and flexibility in the back. Third, you should get regular massage treatments. Massage can help reduce muscle tension, improve flexibility, and increase circulation. Massage therapy can also decrease inflammation and improve rehabilitation. Finally, you should practice relaxation techniques. Stress can be a contributing factor to lower back pain. Chronic stress can, over time, cause the muscles and ligaments in the back to become tense and inflamed. Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or yoga, can help to reduce stress and pain. Lower back pain can be a very debilitating condition, but with the right treatment and lifestyle changes, it can be managed. Talk to your doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Additionally, be sure to incorporate posture, exercise, massage, and relaxation into your routine in order to reduce the pain and prevent future episodes."},{"prompt":"Why should we not use firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali?","completion":"‚ÄúEk din se kya hota hain??!!‚Äù (Burning crackers for a day won‚Äôt make any difference!)

Here are some tips: Clearly define your objective: Before starting a conversation, be clear about your purpose and what you hope to achieve. Having a specific goal in mind will help you focus the discussion and obtain more relevant and helpful responses.Ask specific questions: Instead of asking open-ended or vague questions, try to be as specific as possible. This helps Chat GPT understand your query better and provide a more targeted response. Break down complex questions into smaller parts if needed.Provide context: Give relevant background information or context for your questions. By providing context, you help Chat GPT understand your situation and provide more accurate and useful responses.Critical thinking and verification: Chat GPT is a powerful tool, but it's important to remember that it generates responses based on patterns it has learned from training data. Exercise critical thinking and cross-check information obtained from Chat GPT with reliable sources to verify its accuracy.Be aware of limitations: While Chat GPT can provide helpful information and insights, it may not always have access to the most up-to-date or complete information.

My singing is horrible, it would make someone‚Äôs ears bleed if I tried to sing really loud. Which is why I don‚Äôt sing lol. -Cesar Alcaraz"},{"prompt":"What would you tell someone to order for their first time in an Indian restaurant?","completion":"Indian food has so many varities that sometimes it gets difficult to choose. In US, we normally get North Indian food restaurants or South Indian food restaurants. If you are visiting North Indian restaurants, you should give a try to Samosas as an appetizer. Chole Bhature is also a must try but it is very filling, you cannot have anything after that In main course you can try Dal Makhani and any Paneer (cottage cheese) curry. If you like non vegetarian then you can go for chicken and mutton curries. In flat bread, you should definitely try Butter Naan or Stuffed Naan. If visiting South Indian restaurant, you should definitely try Dosas and Idli. In dosas, I always prefer Masala Dosa as I am vegetarian, but you can get non vegetarian versions as well. I have just covered North and South Indian restaurants food, but food varieties in India are so wide that even being an Indian and born and bought up there, I haven't tried all."},{"prompt":"Would you rather make out with a vampire or make out with a mermaid?","completion":"Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWow!

Either expression is civilised."},{"prompt":"What are some constraints on innovation that are preventing us from becoming the science fiction world so many movies predicted?","completion":"The main constraint is motivation. People take CS to get a coding job instead of physics to produce Star Trek technology. You can blame companies like Microsoft, which have turned an entire generation into ‚Äúcoders‚Äù who are not interested in the ‚ÄúSpace Age‚Äù technology that made the sixties so spectacular. To produce the innovation you are talking about, physics needs to be as popular as IT, so that people are building novel devices in their dorm-room the way they produce things like Snapchat. One way to popularise physics is to use VR to create a virtual Starfleet Academy, so that people can learn Relativity and quantum mechanics aboard a virtual Starship Voyager, but this is unlikely to happen, since VR is in the hands of software companies that see it as technology to be used for third-person shooter or superhero games. If physics could be popularised, there would be a lot more people like Elon Musk."},{"prompt":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","completion":"I honestly feel that you should let him keep making music if it makes him happy."},{"prompt":"What is swing trading?","completion":"Swing trading is a trading strategy that involves holding stocks or other securities for a period of time that can range from a few days to a few weeks.

Swing traders typically use technical analysis to identify the underlying trends and patterns in the market, such as support and resistance levels, moving averages, and other technical indicators.

That can be anything from a political agenda to a religious, social, cultural, or economic agenda. If you‚Äôre going to write about what you perceive to be the truth, then tell it like it is and don‚Äôt make obvious sugar coats. In the context of fiction or story-telling, George R.R. Martin once said in 2011 that there are two approaches: [LINKED_TEXT: The Architect and the Gardner.] [URL: https://www.insider.com/why-winds-of-winter-is-taking-so-long-2017-1] Architect style of writing: \\"The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they're going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there's going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up.\\" Gardening style of writing: \\"The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it,\\" he told the Guardian. \\"They kind of know what seed it is, they know if [they] planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they find out as it grows.\\" The gardening style of writing clearly works well if you‚Äôre trying to create legendary characters, but I think the Architect style works better for most people. A good writer should always plan out what he‚Äôs going to say before he says it. I very much deplore the ‚Äúsoundbite‚Äù technique that corporate advertisers and political debates are premised on, and when I see it used as a writing style, I automatically assume that the writer isn‚Äôt very smart and therefore not worth listening to."},{"prompt":"What is issuing authority in a passport?

Someone told me that if we hit the proton with its antimatter, it would go away? Does it expire or turn into energy? Which one is real?","completion":"oh my - where to start? first: what is matter? most people would define matter as something, that is somehow composed of fermions - aka, particles with spin 1/2. this begs the question: how would these people categorize bosons - particles with spin 0 or 1? both are particles. what is a particle? well - on very low level you only have fields. those fields fill up all points in space and time. and yes - they overlap. if you put the right amount of energy into those fields, you can create something called a local excitation. if you think about a standing wave, you are wrong but not completely. it‚Äôs a useful analogy even if it is not correct. and yes - particles are just that - excitations of the underlying field. a packet of energy in that field, if you like. what is mass? mass is an intrinsic property of a particle. it defines how much that particle is able to resist an acceleration. therefore mass is the same as inertia. but where does that inertia come from? well - most fields can interact with a special field: the higgs field. this field is special as every point of that field has a positive energy content even if it is not excited. if one field interacts with the higgs field, it can ‚Äúborrow‚Äù some of that energy. that energy is then confined in an excitation of that field. but as einstein already showed: confined energy behaves for an outside observer just the same as inertia - you can‚Äôt distinguish between them in an experiment. therefore we define mass simply as intrinsic potential energy. and yes - that e=mc¬≤ business is exactly that: the realisation, that mass is just a special form of energy. one of the principles, that we think is universally true, is the principle of conservation of energy. you can‚Äôt create or destroy energy. you can only convert it from one form into another. if you have a proton, it is comprised of three valence quarks, various gluons and some quark-anti-quark-pairs. all of these particles are excitations of their corresponding fields. if you bring in an anti-proton, it is also comprised of quarks and gluons - but all of them have the exact opposite charge. we call quarks, we usually see in normal life, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù quarks and quarks with the opposite change ‚Äúanti-quarks‚Äù. this is just convention - you could call them left-quarks and right-quarks or whatever. it doesn‚Äôt matter. what matters is: both the quark and the anti-quark are excitations of the same field. if you bring them close enough together, they both cancel out - the excitations cease to exist. but the energy of those excitations can‚Äôt simply disappear - it must go somewhere else. the quarks inside a proton are quite light-weight: they contain relatively little energy. there are not that many other particles, that have less energy. usually, all the energy of those quarks is ‚Äútransfered‚Äù into the electromagnetic field, where it creates other excitations. we call excitations of the electromagnetic field ‚Äúphotons‚Äù. and if some of these photons hits you, we call it ‚Äúlight‚Äù. so yeah - if you define matter as stuff, that is solely comprised of fermions, then you can completely destroy matter - by transfering the energy, that is stored in those fermions into other fields, that are associeted with bosons. the easiest way is to transfer the energy into the electromagnetic field - you convert matter into light. and yes - some people would define light (aka photons/bosons) as ‚Äúpure energy‚Äù. this is of course wrong - there is nothing like ‚Äúpure energy‚Äù. there are only different forms of energy, that can be converted into another. so - what you can do is to transfer energy from one field to another. there are some rules, how this energy transfer can occur. some transfer modes are easier to achieve then others. some are ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù (aka: have never been observed in a laboratory). and yes - in a way, you could call the transfer of energy from some quark field into the electromagnetic field as destruction of matter."},{"prompt":"lost my email password.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","completion":"Put simply It all comes down to your mind set. So you may have a 150+ IQ, but that doesn't mean you‚Äôre free from some of the burdens in life like depression, lack of self worth and/or belief and/or self loathing. If one suffered from any of those thoughts IQ plays a very little part in their life. Advantages are there but you need to know how to use them. Having a 150+ IQ doesn't mean you know how to use it to your advantage without putting in the work and learning how to use it. Finding ones self, taking reflection on who you are, who you want to be and what you need to do to get there are things you need to figure out before you can use your IQ as an advantage. A 150+ IQ is someone who is thought to be a genius. This theory always makes me laugh. Yes someone may have a huge advantage in the thought processes of a particular task but that doesn't mean that they'll excel with everything they do in life. In a lot of instances people with a really high IQ find some tasks difficult that people with an IQ of 100 have no issues with. Personally I see my strengths as being analytical. Patterns, numbers even the power of foresite (Dr Emitt Brown from the Back to the Future series calls this seeing 4th dimensionally) mankind is known as being a lazy spieces. This is why we invent or create items that make the jobs we need to do easier. I'm great at making things in my life easier now days. Disadvantages are there defienity. Previously I mentioned that simple mundane tasks can be difficult, having good communication skills, Being able to communicate with others on the same level also doing this without sounding ignorant or arrogant can be difficult. Sometimes you may be seen as being insensitive or have a lack of understanding. Emotionally challenged individuals have it worse as a lot of times they're seen as being cold or heartless. Being able to analyze things is great till you over analysis it. Sometimes things works to well for their or your own good. LOL. Speaking from experience. If you are at peace with yourself and the world then yes it's so great being 150+ but they also say that igonarance is bliss so Maybe having an IQ of under 100 is that much better. Maybe if I got dementia some day I'd be able to debate. I haven't read anyone else's replies so I'm guessing a lot may be similar.

All species are probably related - so right from the start you do not understand how evolution works.If we have parallel evolution, the two species will LOOK like they have evolved the same function, but when we compare the DNA we see the same function evolved twice.For example, we now know there are two branches of ‚Äúbats‚Äù. The common ancestor of all bats was not a bat. The flying mammal species we call ‚Äúbats‚Äù today evolved twice in two different lines of inheritance.There is some similarity of human eye and octopus eye. Yet the common ancestor of both was probably a light sensitive spot on a tiny invertibrate species that could not fossilise, and we would probably not notice today if they were still around but not very numerous.The genome is statistically unlikely to evolve to become more similar. DNA evolves by both random variation and selection. Even when the same approximate function is evolved, it is much less likely it is the same protein, and almost impossible for the part of the genome for that function to be even remotely ‚Äúidentical‚Äù.The genome is for all intents and purposes impossible to ‚Äúconverge‚Äù - even if the two species of bats look exactly the same. Evolution is always about how much the genome diverges, not converges, and only sexual function can reduce the ‚Äúdivergence‚Äù by ‚Äúcorrecting‚Äù for deviations in one parent with the sequence from the other parent that did not diverge. The two species of bats that look exactly the same but have an ancestor in common that was not at bat will have a record of the divergence in their DNA. We expect the genome to diverge, even with parallel evolution making it look like they both inherited it from the common ancestor. In fact, even with human beings we see evidence that our own evolution has both divergence of genome and convergence of function. There is now some evidence that shows that the common ancestor of humans and chimps walked upright a lot more than chimps do now.Making it entirely possible that human evolution evolved bipedal locomotion TWICE, while chimpanzee evolution evolved it only once, and then evolved back again so they could not run with tools in their hands.Even before we had the DNA and fossil evidence, we already noticed that chimpanzees did not walk on two feet the way we did - suggesting that at a time in the past - presumably before the split with our line - our ancestors in common walked more than they do now, albeit a little less than australopithicines did.And blonde hair is now proved to have evolved in ‚Äúparallel evolution‚Äù - functionally identical, genetically diverse - in different human ‚Äúraces‚Äù.

I like wearing diapers, I'm a lifelong ABDL and I don't see that changing anytime soon, but diapers are never gonna be a style trend.

In reality, we use the majority of our brain, albeit not all at once. If we were somehow able to access 100% of our brain simultaneously, it is difficult to predict the exact consequences. The brain's intricate network and functional specialization suggest that using the entire brain at once could lead to overwhelming sensory input, heightened cognitive abilities, and potentially altered states of consciousness. However, it is important to note that this notion of unlocking untapped brain potential remains speculative, as our current understanding of brain function does not support the idea of dormant unused portions waiting to be awakened."},{"prompt":"Which is the best ethical hacking course?","completion":"LIVEWIRE ‚Äì A Division of CADD Centre Training Services Pvt.Ltd, is an approved Skill Development Partner of National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC).

Hotels can range from fairly cheap to very expensive, but you generally get what you pay for. The best way to reduce the cost of a hotel is to compare hotel prices. This used to be a difficult and time-consuming task, but the Internet has changed all that. Sites like Travelocity and Expedia are a great way to make a hotel deal because they can negotiate a lower price on your behalf. The problem is that there are now so many websites that offer this service that it is difficult to know which ones can offer you the best offer. Previously you had to do a hotel price comparison between hotels, now you have to do the comparison between hotel booking websites. Fortunately, the Internet has come to the rescue again. Now there are websites where you can compare prices from all the online booking sites. This is the best way to ensure you get the best deal possible. There is no secret to getting a good price on a hotel room, it's just a matter of comparing hotel prices. The Internet has greatly simplified this process, but it has also created new problems. There are now so many websites promising the best hotel rates that it can be difficult to choose just one. Fortunately, several new websites have appeared where you can compare prices across all the online booking sites and see who really has the best prices."},{"prompt":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","completion":"Tracing someone's name through a mobile number can be challenging, as personal information is generally protected and not publicly available. However, there are a few methods you can try: 1. Reverse Phone Lookup Websites: Many online platforms allow you to perform a reverse phone lookup, where you enter the mobile number and receive publicly available information associated with it. Popular websites for this purpose include Whitepages, Truecaller, and Spy Dialer. 2. Social Media Search: If the person has linked their mobile number to their social media accounts, you can try searching for the phone number on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn. If the number is associated with their account, you may find their profile. 3. Search Engines: Simply entering the mobile number into search engines like Google or Bing might provide some relevant information if the person has used that number publically on websites, directories, or forums. 4. Contact the Mobile Service Provider: In certain cases, if there is a valid reason, you may contact the mobile service provider and request information about the owner of a particular number. However, this approach may require legal authorization or a legitimate investigation. It's important to note that privacy laws and regulations vary across countries, so make sure to comply with local laws and respect the privacy of others when attempting to trace someone's name through a mobile number."},{"prompt":"w can cells be seen with the naked eye?","completion":"Yep all of them"},{"prompt":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","completion":"I though I would add some supporting information to [LINKED_TEXT: Rob Hilleary] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Rob-Hilleary]‚Äôs answer.

He wants to move out, but the property management says they will not remove him from the lease. Can property management do that?","completion":"There are many small details to consider but here are some things to look at. It might be obvious but some quick legal advice is best. Local volunteer tenant boards and associations often have legal advisors on hand who can help for no fees but small donation would be appreciated. Verify if your lease is actually with the PM company or if they are in fact assigned as the owners agent. Often a PM company only administers lease terms and collects rent but are not a ‚Äúlegal agent‚Äù or ‚Äúparty‚Äù to the lease contract. If they are not authorized to act as an agent or not a party to the lease, they may not have the authority to remove him. If this is the case you can seek an agreement with the actual owner to amend your contract and remove him. If you are agreeing to continue the lease commitment they may well agree. Having his name on the lease as an occupant is different form being a party to the contract. his name may appear as an occupant or dependant but if he did not sign, they may just wish to have more ‚Äúnames to hunt‚Äù in a default situation. If you are already ok with your son moving out and can carry the lease commitment out to the end on your own, his leaving should have little or no impact unless you default. Another simple solution is to find another room-mate with good credit and they will probably allow a substitution of co-tenant/ occupant. In some jurisdictions, if he was under 18, legally a minor or not of age to make or be party to a contract at time of entering the lease contract, it is possibly not binding.

I suddenly came across a question, which triggered in my memory a story which I heard during my childhood. I typed that story in the answer and just added one more sentence after the story.

I want every aspirating author to know that great writings are not created. They simply happen through you. What is true for my Quora answers in also true for book writing. My first book ‚ÄòPractising Spiritual Intelligence‚Äô was published in 2013. It took me almost 6 months to complete the book and another two years to edit and finally see my book on the bookshelf. It takes around one to two years to write a book, get it edited and published and I have published 7 books so far in last 7 years. However, my latest book ‚ÄòEssay and Answer Writing for UPSC Civil Services‚Äô was written with least effort and accidentally. In the month of February 2020, I got an email from Disha Publication inviting me to write a book for them for UPSC examination. I had already written a book for UPSC for ‚ÄòEthics, Integrity and Aptitude‚Äô, which was being published by Wisdom Tree.

Your writing are like your children who may be born through you, but they have the life of their own. The Lebanese poet Kahlil Gibran said this beautiful, Your children are not your children. They are sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you. And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You asked about my life experience (even if not me specifically), and I‚Äôm flattered so I want to answer. Here‚Äôs 2011 me, taken at a ukulele festival in Indiana. I poured a ton of my time and energy and what little money I had at the time into being part of the ‚Äúukulele community‚Äù (I put it in quotes, but it really is a wonderful, welcoming, and tight knit group of people) I had too much to drink and wound up embarrassing myself. My wife and I had a 1 year old daughter and lived in a two bedroom apartment in Maryland. I worked with a nonprofit to support adults who have developmental disabilities in the workplace. I was living a pretty day-to-day, hand-to-mouth existence, and I actually thought it was a good idea to be seen in public wearing a porkpie hat: And here‚Äôs 2016 me: I still like hats. This is me doing a live PA techno / ambient performance at a gaming convention. I wound up drinking far too much and leaving my headphones at the bar (though I was able to recover them the next day). I pour a ton of my time, energy, and spending money into my efforts at becoming a vaguely successful electronic musician. I‚Äôm financially stable, and I live in a 3 bedroom townhouse. I‚Äôve got two kids now, ages 6 and 4. I‚Äôm still happily married to the same woman. I‚Äôve been working as a special education teacher for about four and a half years. I‚Äôve had my left ankle replaced with an artificial joint. I look and feel quite a bit older, but someone on the outside looking in may disagree. See, it‚Äôs tough to compare 27 year old me with 32 year old me because I see 27 year old me through the lenses of nostalgia, regret, and the knowledge of how those choices turned out for me in the end. It‚Äôs impossible to look at myself now objectively, but here are my impressions of how I think I‚Äôve changed as a result of my formative experiences over the last five years: I‚Äôm a lot more comfortable with who I am these days‚ÄîI realize that just because I‚Äôm a grown ass man now I‚Äôm not immune to changing. I‚Äôve realized that when I had less money and lived in less comfortable digs, many of my life choices were made out of real or perceived urgency or necessity. Now that I have job security and financial stability, it‚Äôs easier to slow down and think through things more carefully. I‚Äôve admitted to myself that I struggle with depression and anxiety and I‚Äôve sought help. Seeking help was a helpful thing to do. My priorities have shifted from day to day survival to thinking about long term goals.

This room in the photo is of the Echo room at Abbey Road EMI studios in London England. The history of sound effects, and how they were first discovered and applied in the recording industry is a very large one, I won‚Äôt delve into this too deeply because Quora readers prefer concise, informative answers. This effect of Echo could be adjusted, but of course the expense and physical demands for this effect meant that only very well resourced, wealthy recording companies could manage to use these effects. The Digital age, of course changed all of this. It was discovered that emulation of physical space could be achieved using chips/transistors and chains of circuits -as in the Bucket-Brigade circuit which has been used to great effect to create delay effects. Reverberation, or Reverb for short, was one of the earliest sound effects to be used, reverb produces a sense of space, it is a form of delay but the reflections are very short as if the voice, or instrument is originating from a much larger room, or physical space, Delay is similar to Reverb but the differences are found in the extent, and timing of reflections. A dedicated Delay pedal can be adjusted to produce simple reverb, but you also have the option to adjust the delay parameters to produce actual repeats of the original signal, you have considerably more flexibility. Reverb by itself is a simple form of delay, and you can also adjust this to a certain extent, but with reverb you never have a repeat of the original signal, it is all about reflection of one original sound, this may be adjusted to produce a very large space, if you go to ‚Äò10‚Äô, Dick Dale was a guitar player in the ‚ÄòSurf Rock‚Äô genre and he was noted for his use of lots of Reverb from his Fender Twin amplifiers. So the essential differences between a Reverb pedal and a Delay pedal is the ‚Äòrepeat‚Äô capability of your delay device, this can give you a wide range of repeat parameters, whereas the Reverb pedal will provide a sense of spatial distance, you cannot set a repeat on the original sound."},{"prompt":"Which is the affordable bulk SMS marketing service provider in Bangalore?","completion":"They are many, you can still feel free to reach www.stridist.in"},{"prompt":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","completion":"Just don't"},{"prompt":"What is the most shocking substitution in a football match?","completion":"The year is 2006.

Out goes number 9, Fernand√£o, long time idol and the top scorer of the team in the season, and in goes Adriano Gabiru, also a striker but not more than an average player. You didn't have to be anywhere near Porto Alegre to hear people screaming, cursing and wishing the death of the gaffer. It wasn't a bold move. It was a stupid move. Ridiculously stupid. At the 81st miunte, Luiz Adriano finds Iarley moving up the field marked by the two Barcelona center backs. Iarley holds the two defenders until Gabiru passes by his left. He plays the perfect pass.

Would he have been dragged through the street like Gaddafi?","completion":"Mussolini and his mistress in Milan You raise an interesting question. From history, we know what Hitler thought would happen to him and his mistress, Eva Braun. Mussolini and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, we‚Äôre executed by Italian Parsons on April 28, 1945. Their bodies were then, after much abuse, strung up from an Esso station in the city of.Milan. News of the execution of Mussolini and his mistress reached Hitler on afternoon of April 29, 1945. On April 30, 1945, Hitler and his mistress, Eva Braun, committed suicide shortly before the city of Berlin fell to Soviet soldiers. Some historians believe that what happened to Mussolini was a factor in Hitler's decision to commit suicide and have his body burned. Alan Bullock said that news of Mussolini's fate had presumably increased Hitler's determination to avoid capture. William Shirer thought that knowledge of the events surrounding Mussolini's death may have strengthened Hitler's resolve not to risk his downfall being turned into a public humiliation. Ian Kershaw states that while it is uncertain whether Hitler was told the details of Mussolini's death: if he did learn of the full gory tale, it could have done no more than confirm his anxiety to take his own life before it was too late, and to prevent his body from being seized by his enemies There is a general agreement among most historians, however, that had Hitler and his mistress, Eva Braun, been taken alive, they would have been subject to many of the same humiliation that Mussolini and his mistress were subject to.

An alarmingly large number of ‚Äúscience demonstrations‚Äù on YouTube are faked.

It claims to be showing a perpetual motion machine. The details of how it claims to work are rather unimportant - because it‚Äôs clearly impossible. The laws of thermodynamics guarantee it‚Äôs a fake. One VERY suspicious thing happens when the presenter places the green ball onto the extreme left of the track. The ball is rolled towards the center - which would mean that with the red ball farther from the center than the green one - that the machine would stay tipped to the right - and as the green ball hits the end-stop at the center of the machine - the transfer of momentum should re-enforce the motion to the right‚Ä¶but it doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶the contraption starts to tip to the left at precisely the time it should be tipping to the right. Even without knowing much physics - it somehow feels ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. At time 0:37 - the green ball is still closer to the center than the red ball - yet the machine is tipping to the left. How is that even possible? If you watch it closely enough - the plank tips BEFORE the balls start rolling in that direction‚Ä¶which makes no sense. It‚Äôs possible though that it‚Äôs even simpler than that. Here are two screen captures from the video: Do you see a thin black line under each end of the board? CONCLUSION: This video is a fake - the presenter is a liar and a cheat - he‚Äôs clearly manipulating the motions of the board using two threads that run through the table top. 3 million YouTube views means that he‚Äôs making a lot of money from gullible people. Scientists look at something like this - and IMMEDIATELY know - for 100% sure - that it‚Äôs a fake.

However, to determine the appropriate size, you can follow these general guidelines: Measure your hand: Use a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your dominant hand just below the knuckles. Make sure to measure around the widest part of your palm.Consult the size chart: Most glove manufacturers provide size charts that correlate hand circumference measurements with glove sizes. These charts can typically be found on the product packaging or the manufacturer's website.Consider fit and preference: Weightlifting gloves should fit snugly but not be overly tight. The gloves should allow for proper finger movement and a comfortable grip on the weights. Keep in mind that different brands may have slight variations in sizing, so it's a good idea to read customer reviews or try on gloves if possible. It's worth noting that some individuals prefer not to use gloves while weightlifting, as they prefer the direct contact and improved grip with the weights. Ultimately, the choice of wearing gloves or not is a personal preference based on factors such as comfort, grip, and protection.

However, there have been concerns about the safety of cooking food in a microwave oven. In particular, some people worry that the radiation emitted by microwave ovens can be harmful to human health. The good news is that there is no evidence to suggest that microwave ovens are dangerous when used properly. The type of radiation used by microwave ovens is non-ionizing, which means that it does not have enough energy to break apart molecules or cause cellular damage. In fact, microwave ovens are considered to be one of the safest cooking methods available. That being said, there are some potential hazards associated with microwave ovens. For example, if the [LINKED_TEXT: microwave oven parts] [URL: https://www.partsips.com/amana-appliance-parts], such as the door or the seals, are damaged, then there is a risk of radiation leakage. This can be dangerous, so it is important to have your microwave oven inspected regularly to ensure that all parts are in good working order. Another concern is that microwave cooking can lead to a loss of nutrients in the food. This is because the high heat generated by the microwave oven can cause some of the vitamins and minerals in the food to break down. However, this is not unique to microwave cooking and can happen with any form of cooking that uses high heat. It is also important to note that some types of plastic containers can release harmful chemicals when heated in a microwave oven. To avoid this, use microwave-safe containers and avoid using plastic wrap or containers that are not specifically labeled as microwave-safe. In conclusion, cooking food in a microwave oven is generally considered safe, provided that the appliance parts are in good working order. While there are some potential hazards associated with microwave cooking, these can be easily avoided by using microwave-safe containers and regularly inspecting your microwave oven. So go ahead and heat up your leftovers without worry ‚Äì your microwave oven is a safe and convenient way to prepare food."},{"prompt":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","completion":"India‚Äôs First Train: Contrary to popular belief, the first train in India was the Red Hill Railway, which ran from Red Hills to Chintadripet bridge in 1837.

But suppose if one dollor is equal to one rupee then who so ever will buy the products from india same things they will buy from other country where currency rates are cheaper or else he would buy the same product from USA only. Thus our export will be lower and Import will be higher. Thus the current account deficit of our country will be no longer positive and than how we will be in the condition which we cannot even think about it.

After I graduated I got a job as far away from the Bay as I could (I moved to DC), and vowed to never come back. My reason? Everything was so obscenely expensive, especially housing. I remembered lamenting back in 2004 that with student loan debt and the rate of housing cost increase, there‚Äôs no chance for anyone in my generation to buy a house. Fast forward 10 years later, I was living in Seattle at the time, I was working at a job I hated and my fianc√© at the time got a job offer down in the Bay that would effectively more than double her salary. It was so transformative for her career that we just couldn‚Äôt pass it up. Plus I was ready for a change myself so we basically packed up and moved back to my hometown 10 years after I moved away‚Ä¶ So ya basically back in the Bay because of my now wife (who was originally from Iowa FWIW)."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between granite and marble?","completion":"Marble - Metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals is called marble stone. marble refers to metamorphosed limestone.

What do you think of when you see the picture below? A house vent for warm heat in the winter and cool air in the summers, right? Wrong! At least not in my house growing up! We called this the the Math Torture Vent. My mom used to make me kneel on it while I memorized my multiplication table up to 12x, when I was five years old. If I lost focus and didn‚Äôt rehearse quickly enough, my knee caps would start bleeding. We used to play this math game in elementary school where students would go head-to-head to see who could answer multiplication questions first. The winner would go onto the next person, like the math version of king‚Äôs court. This is literally the one game in grade school that I never lost, my mom made sure of that. My parents fled to Canada during the Vietnam war. They were poor, spoke no English and were uneducated. Their hard nosed, traditional East Asian parenting style is one of the few things they were able to take with them onto the escape boat. So it‚Äôs hard for me to blame them for it, given the hell they went through to ensure their kids were safe and had an opportunity at a fair life. Was it the best way to teach a child mathematics? Hell to the no! Was it the most loving way to teach a child? Not one bit! Would it be considered borderline abuse in 2018? Probably. The question however is, ‚ÄòWhat's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?‚Äô Was it creative? I‚Äôd say so."},{"prompt":"Are microchip implants safe for dogs?","completion":"Not if they're floating in a COVID vaccine. üòÅ Thank you for your question."},{"prompt":"What company offers good mobile application development services?","completion":"Expert Mobile App Development at Your Service!

While photography may be new, color photography is a far more recent development. Perhaps this is why B&W images are used (and often ideal) for creating a certain sense of timelessness. Experimental Photography Experimental photography uses photo manipulation to alter our perceptions as well as our expectations. Photographers often use this type of art to tell a story or create art specific to their cause (e.g. cover art, fantastical photographs, and even advertisements). Travel Photography Travel photography can be deeply personal or highly sellable, depending on the specific content. We‚Äôve all seen (and drooled over) travel blogs and websites, in which people document everything from Stonehenge to hotel rooms. In defining travel photography, it really comes down to the story; the photographer captures new sites and we get to see those sites from their perspective. Landscape Photography Landscape photography is perhaps one of the most traditional photography styles, and it‚Äôs no mystery as to why; our world has fantastic views. Capturing landscapes through photography is a powerful skill, as it often allows an honest documentation of nature. However, you may notice landscape photography does not always capture nature exclusively Fashion Photography Fashion photography is a high-end genre focused on showcasing clothing and products. This style of photography is commonly associated with magazines like Elle, Vogue, Vanity Fair, and other lifestyle features. This popular genre is growing fast across university campuses, as many young people utilize this style in their fashion/beauty blogs. Portrait Photography [LINKED_TEXT: Portrait photography] [URL: https://verveportraits.com.au/] can be useful in a variety of projects, be it commercial or political. Portrait photography gives viewers the chance to connect with the subject of a photo. Unlike advertising photography, the subject of a portrait may or may not be made to look flawless. Portraits can include headshots or full-body shots, and they can encompass a number of emotions and imagery."},{"prompt":"What are the best freelancing sites?","completion":"You can check Fiverr..its the one of the best sites for freelancers."},{"prompt":"organ similar enough to piano where a piano player that doesn‚Äôt know organ can just switch over to organ and it would be easy?","completion":"I answered [LINKED_TEXT: basically the same question] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-do-pianists-play-the-organ/answer/Barnaby-Page] recently and I hope the details in the answer to that will help you. In summary, though: The bottom line is that a pianist can easily play the organ not very well. It‚Äôs not like switching to, say, the guitar or the oboe where you won‚Äôt even know how to produce the notes. You will be able to play them, in the literal sense of putting your fingers in the right places, from day one. But they won‚Äôt necessarily sound great. Playing the organ well requires learning quite a few new things and unlearning quite a lot of old ones. The same applies to organists moving to the piano (though in reality most organists started on the piano anyway). And, of course, it‚Äôs important to consider what kind of organ playing the pianist is being called upon to do. If it‚Äôs just playing a few hymns for church, the transition isn‚Äôt going to be too demanding. For example, though it will be necessary to get used to the very different approach to articulation (especially legato) on the organ, it‚Äôs perfectly possible to play hymns well without using the pedals and without complex stop changes. On the other hand, if you want to play substantial pieces of organ repertoire, there‚Äôs a lot more to learn. As an aside: pedals are less important in most organ playing than most non-organists realise - they‚Äôre there, sure, but the pedal part is rarely the most challenging or significant thing about a piece. There is a lot of quite major organ repertoire where the role of the pedals is minimal."},{"prompt":"the NDA training the toughest?","completion":"Watch this video and you would get an idea.

That‚Äôs why DC comics has their own Thor. That‚Äôs why a movie studio I have never heard of could make a movie entitled Thor: End of Days that is as blatant a rip-off as I have ever seen.

Marvel only owns the very, very specific version of Thor that appears in its comics. Marvel‚Äôs copyright covers works it published featuring Thor. And it‚Äôs trademark applies in the most narrow possible of ways to specifically their version of Thor. Anyone can use Thor or any element of Norse mythology in any work. And as long as they can plausibly claim that it is based on the myths themselves and not the very specific version of Thor appearing in Marvel comics, then there‚Äôs nothing Disney can do about it. Now a character like the Enchantress who is original to the comics‚Ä¶ well she‚Äôs much more well protected from infringement. If anyone gets tripped up and successfully sued by Disney it would far more likely be because they used something unique to the comics, like the Enchantress or the Warriors Three, than because they used Thor himself (no matter how similar to the comic book version he is)."},{"prompt":"Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?","completion":"There are many reasons why people might stay in unhealthy or abusive relationships.

Having a strong social media presence offers numerous benefits to your business. You have a larger reach to customers outside your immediate area. Leveraging your social media marketing correctly can profit you more customers and sales. Living in the digital age, it is important to learn how to take advantage of this unique opportunity to grow your business. Firstly, different social media apps and websites combine billions of active users daily. Reaching even the smallest fraction of these users can take your business to the next level. Having engaging content, compelling designs, and promotion will attract more customers who have not found your business yet. One of the benefits of social media is the advanced tools it offers to reach a specific audience. If you are a business that sells kitchen tools, you don‚Äôt want to spend money on advertisements that will be sent to kids, teenagers, gamers, etc. You would want that ad to target someone in their mid-20s and up, a mother or grandmother, cooks, and chefs. You want your advertisement to target an audience that will be interested in your product. Being able to target your audience by interest, location, and demographics is some of the few ways to narrow your reach to your target audience. This allows you to maximize the return on your advertisement investments. Having a strong social media presence can give any business a competitive edge. Consumers that have to decide between two businesses will be more than likely to choose the business with the most recognition and strong reputation. In order to maintain this competitive edge, your business has to actively engage with your customers. Leveraging your social media correctly will set you apart from other competitors. To be a successful business, you need feedback to learn and improve on. Social media has many tools to help you with. Social media provides you with files of data and feedback from your audience. The data includes engagements, demographics, reach, and more. Using this data you can modify your product or marketing strategies to better relate with your audience. If you haven‚Äôt noticed the trend throughout this reading; relating to your customer is extremely important. Social media pushes you to build a meaningful relationship with your audience. Consistent efforts to interact and push out engaging content will build that trusting bond with your customers. Having a brand with loyal and supportive customers will create a fulfilling and long-lasting business. In conclusion, social media marketing offers numerous benefits for businesses in the digital space. Increasing social media engagements and building customer relationships are some of the few ways to thrive on social media. To create a long-lasting social media brand, you need to be fully committed and engaged in the entire process. With the correct marketing strategies and commitment, you can elevate your business to the next level.

The Jedi Council did not want Jinn to accept Skywalker as his apprentice, regardless of how powerful he was, because he was too old, but Jinn ignored them. When Jinn died, his last words were a plea to Kenobi to take Anakin as his apprentice because Jinn was sure Anakin was the Chosen One. The Council relented and allowed Kenobi to do so. The Jedi Council was not even going to allow Anakin to become a Jedi, and only because of extraordinary conditions and happenings did they finally allow it to happen.

I went to a conservative Christian college, where alcohol use was prohibited. So, being normal young people, my friends and I broke the rules now and then. During our senior year, we started collecting our empty bottles because we had the same concern that the asker had. We didn‚Äôt want to get caught disposing of the evidence of our crime. The night before our graduation, as we were gleefully creating more empty bottles, we hit on the idea of taking all our empties and covering the Dean of Students‚Äô car with them. We weren‚Äôt malicious. We liked her just fine, and she was a family friend of mine. Still, we wanted to make a statement, and under the influence of impending freedom and plentiful alcohol, having our parents show up for graduation and see the evidence of our crime seemed like a great idea. So, that‚Äôs what we did. We went to the parking lot and gently covered every available horizontal surface on her car with bottles. We never got caught and we never found out what happened as a result of our prank, but it is a glorious (if fuzzy) memory. Where can I discreetly get rid of wine bottles?"},{"prompt":"Do British people wholeheartedly agree with Suella Braverman when she said ‚ÄúBoris Johnson is one of the greatest prime ministers ever‚Äù?","completion":"Suella Braverman is so deluded, the vast majority of the British electret don't just hate Boris Johnson, they despise him like they do her.

One day, he told me that he had found a good way. It is the story about my little nephew. ‚ÄúDad, how do you do this question?‚Äù Hearing his son‚Äôs question, the father frowned. He don‚Äôt know how many times his son had asked questions. Whenever he encounters a problem, he asks his parents for help, and he doesn‚Äôt even know his own thinking. Seeing the question his son brought, Dad‚Äôs brows deepened. Such a question is not difficult for his son at all. As long as he uses his brain and thinks a little, the answer will come out. ‚ÄúYou take a good look at the question yourself, then think about it, you will know the answer.‚Äù Dad didn‚Äôt want to tell his son the answer directly, he wanted his son to try to think for himself. The son who didn‚Äôt get the answer returned to the table, frowning and looking at the question in front of him, he couldn‚Äôt do anything. Looking at his son who was thinking hard, he felt that this was useless. So, Dad put down the newspaper in his hand, came to his son and sat down. Seeing his father sitting next to him, the son thought that his father was willing to tell him the answer. However, Dad still did not say the answer, but took a pen and a piece of paper. Write down the conditions listed in the title on the paper. At first the son didn‚Äôt understand what his father was doing, so he stared at the paper closely. Slowly, he saw the answer from the paper. So he wrote the answer in his own way. During this period, the father didn‚Äôt say a word, but only used his eyes to encourage his son to find the answer by himself. From then on, when his son encountered a problem again, he no longer asked others the first time, but tried to think for himself and find the answer by himself. Einstein once said: ‚ÄúLearning to think independently and judge independently is more important than acquiring knowledge. People who do not make up their minds to cultivate the habit of thinking will lose the greatest joy in life.‚Äù If children do not have the quality of independent thinking and judgment, they may lack independence throughout their lives, let alone any breakthroughs and creations. Therefore, parents should provide children with as many independent thinking and problem-solving opportunities as possible from an early age, so that children can grow into talents who can think and judge independently. Independent thinking can enrich children‚Äôs imagination and develop children‚Äôs intelligence."},{"prompt":"Can a sociopath feel happiness or have mania/hypomania?","completion":"I‚Äôm manic right now actually.

I suppose I could tell you about the swinger party I went to a couple weeks ago. All I wanted to do actually was be a fly on the wall. For real. The whole group thing grossed me out and once that happened everything is ruined. People got annoying too. It felt like I was on a set for a porno which that was interesting.

As someone who has studied the topic of happiness extensively, I know many factors contribute to our generation's perceived unhappiness. One major factor is the increasing pressure to compare ourselves to others on social media constantly. We are bombarded with images of people living seemingly perfect lives, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with our lives. Additionally, social media can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from others, as we spend more time scrolling through our phones than engaging in meaningful face-to-face interactions. Another factor is the societal pressure to achieve success at a young age. This pressure can come from our families, peers, and even ourselves as we compare our progress. Many of us feel the need to have our lives figured out by our mid-20s, which can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety. I have experienced both of these factors in my own life. In my early 20s, I struggled with feelings of inadequacy and comparison as I saw my friends achieving seemingly great things on social media. It wasn't until I took a step back and realized that people only share their highlight reels on social media that I could break free from these negative thought patterns. Additionally, I focus more on cultivating meaningful relationships with people rather than solely relying on online interactions. In terms of the pressure to achieve success, I struggled with this as I entered the workforce. I felt like I needed to figure everything out right away, leading to stress and anxiety. However, gaining more experience and perspective, I realized that success is more than just a one-size-fits-all concept. I learned to set goals and pace myself rather than constantly comparing myself to others."},{"prompt":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn‚Äôt yours by getting a paternity test?

My youngest daughter was going to the Halloween disco at school. lots of excited 10 year olds dressing up as witches etc. I asked one mother what her daughter was wearing. She said her daughter was not allowed to go, as there was a lot of Evil around on Halloween night, and the children could be infected. ‚Ä¶.This from a physicist! How could she believe Evil was infectious? On one night of the year only!!! And surely the evidence of her own eyes would show her that these children were not infected by Evil when they were dressing up. Anyway, if there is lots of Evil around, surely it would affect everyone, not just people who are dressed up?

But I would reframe the question to ‚ÄòWhat should I choose, a dual degree or a BTech in IIST?‚Äô because one is not better than other. It is just different. Dual degree program at IIST is for people who are interested in pure science rather than engineering aspect of it. The five fields offered for a dual degree are different from Aerospace or Avionics. In a general sense you can say that if you are interested in pure research at a later stage, then you can choose a dual degree program. It helps you save an year when you decide to do a PhD later. But, it is not neccessarily the case. I did BTech in Aerospace Engineering at IIST and worked in ISRO for 3 years. But, since I was interested in fundamental research (which doesn‚Äôt seem to happen a lot in ISRO), I pursued MS in Sweden and now I am doing my PhD in Netherlands. When I took Aerospace, I didn‚Äôt know whether I wanted to research or not. You are also too young to know whether you want to do research in atmospheric science or astrophysics, or whether you want to work in ISRO and build rockets and satellites. So, in my opinion there is no wrong choice here. Whatever you choose, you can always change later. If you are very well informed as a kid and are interested specifically in Astrophysics/Astronomy or Earth sciences, then take dual degree because that will increase you chances of working in Space Physics Lab (SCL) or Physical Research Lab (PRL) which are mainly focused on fundamental research in Astronomy and Earth Sciences. If you are an engineer by heart (if you like building things and if you like Jugaad) then by all means go for BTech. I hope this helps. Send me a pm if you need more specific advice.

But how do people who follow this diet manage to not feel hungry between meals? Well, staying hydrated is key. Drink lots of water or switch things up with some herbal tea or flavored water. This can help you feel fuller and prevent hunger pangs. Additionally, when you do eat, go for nutrient-rich foods like fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins. These will help keep you feeling fuller for longer. It's also important to choose low glycemic index foods and stay away from sugary snacks and processed foods, as they can cause your blood sugar to spike and then drop, leaving you feeling hungry again soon after eating. Mindful eating is another helpful practice. Slow down and savor your food. Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues to prevent overeating. Planning is also crucial. If you know you'll only be eating once or twice a day, it's important to plan your meals ahead of time to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need. It's important to keep in mind that intermittent fasting isn't for everyone, and it's crucial to listen to your body's needs. If you're unsure, it's always a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to make sure you're meeting your nutritional needs."},{"prompt":"Scottish whisky better than American whiskey?

It's big, juicy, and comes with all the toppings you could want. But if you're in the mood for something a little different, McDonald's has a wide variety of menu items to choose from, including their famous Big Mac and McNuggets.

Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"I have attended both private and public schools at different points in my life. And while I only attended a private school for 4 years (K-3), I feel I have had enough of an experience to know for sure. When it comes to education, yes, private schools tend to be much better. Smaller class sizes allow for more personalized instruction. This, in turn, creates more success. in the students, and allows them to grow better. Some of them also offer religious classes. So, education-wise, yes, private schools are head-and-shoulders above public schools. However, in the atmosphere, private schools also have a chance to have a much more toxic environment, at least from the students. The students who are better off can feel like they have the right to do anything to the students who are less wealthy. And, if the families of the wealthier students donate enough money to the school, the administration can be too afraid of losing that funding to do anything about it. So, there are ways where private schools are better than public (such as the education), but some ways that public schools can be better than private (the enviroment/atmosphere). If you wish to get the best of both worlds, you should pick a charter school. -Allons-y!"},{"prompt":"Was Iran/Persia powerful before? Was it full of barbarians as mentioned in the movie ‚Äú300‚Äù?

You can write on whatever topic you like and you can explain things magnificently through your writings. Here are some things that aspiring writers should know about writing: ¬∑ Write regularly and read more- For being a successful writer one should practice writing routinely and should read more as the more you do so, the more innovative ideas you will get and the better you will become. ¬∑ Select your niche- Select the genre on which you would like to construct the story or writings. There are aspects like fiction, mystery, non-fiction, romance, biography, short stories, etc. By selecting your niche, it will be easy for you to focus on that specific area and build on it further. ¬∑ Understand your audience group and their requirements- Be mindful of which audience group is mainly targeting and what are their requirements. For instance, you are writing a self-help book then your main audience group targets are the youth and the adults, so you need to understand their requirements and write down your views and ideas in such a manner that it captures the interest of the audience and increases their curiosity and interest to read more of what you have written. ¬∑ Check that your texts are free from plagiarism- One should always check that what he/she has written is original and not someone else‚Äôs idea.

However, I can tell you that the overwhelming majority of scientists, scientific organizations, and governments around the world agree that climate change is real, and that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are causing the Earth's temperature to rise and the climate to change in ways that will have severe consequences if not addressed. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. They have stated that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. There is also a consensus among scientists that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, the world will warm by several degrees by the end of this century, leading to increased heat waves, sea level rise, ocean acidification, and more severe weather events. It's worth noting that, though Climate change is a complex issue with many different factors, with a great number of scientific studies, data analysis and evidence-based research that support the scientific consensus on climate change.

Sometimes she goes out with friends but comes home late, getting dropped off around the corner and walking the rest of the way. I once picked up the extension while she was on the phone and she got very angry. A buddy of mine plays guitar in a band. He told me that my wife and some guy have been to his gigs. He wanted to borrow my guitar amp. That's when I got the idea to find out for myself what was really happening. I said, \\"Sure, you can use my amp but I want to hide behind it at the gig and see if she comes into the venue, and who she comes in with\\". He agreed. Saturday night came and I slipped behind my Marshall JCM800 half stack to get a good view. It wasn't long before I saw my wife come in with another guy. He bought them drinks and they sat down, conversing flirtatiously with each other. Then, after a while, he got up to go to the bathroom, and she started flirting with the bartender!

With a dedicated ministry and budget in its name, railways help large portions of the country‚Äôs population in running their daily businesses successfully. However, there are a few things you probably don‚Äôt know about our trains and how the entire system works. Read on, and maybe you can remember them; or simply be awed every-time you pass by something even remotely related to the railways. 1. Indian Railways is the largest railways network to be operated by a single government and is the world‚Äôs third largest network with a total length of 127,760 kms. 2. Indian Railways owned the longest railway platform in the world at Kharagpur with a length of 2,733 feet. Now, breaking the record, Gorakhpur station has recently taken its place with a span of 4,430 feet. 3. Two historical railway elements are included in the UNESCO‚Äô World Heritage site list ‚Äì the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, and the Indian Mountain Railways. The Indian Mountain Railways includes three railways ‚Äì the Darjeeling Himalayan Railways, Nilgiri Mountain Railways and Kalka Shimla Railway. All three trains have been functional for some 100 years. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is a classic fusion of Gothic art with Indian architecture. 4. Indian Railways has five luxury trains. These are: Royal Rajasthan on Wheels,Palace on Wheels (Rajasthan),The Golden Chariot (Karnataka and Goa),The Maharajas‚Äô Express (begins in Delhi but the itinerary differs) andThe Deccan Odyssey (begins in Maharashtra but itinerary differs). They are the pride of Indian Railways as they hold an eminent position among the luxury trains of the world. Palace on Wheels is the oldest one of them. 5. The Vivek Express (Dibrugarh to Kanyakumari) travels a distance of 4273 km, which is the longest run in the railways. The shortest run is taken by a few scheduled services between Nagpur and Ajni ‚Äì a total of 3 kms. 6. Srirampur and Belapur are two different stations in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. They are both situated at the same point on the railway route, but are located on opposite sides of the track. 7. Mathura junction has the maximum number of routes emerging from it. 7 of them include ‚Äì Broad Gauge (BG) line to Agra Cantt, BG line to Bharatpur, BG line to Alwar, BG line to Delhi, Metre Gauge (MG) line to Achnera, MG line to Vrindavan and MG line to Hathras. 8. The resonance frequency of the suspension for the coaches is kept as close as possible to 72 bpm or 1.2 Hz while designing. The human body is most comfortable at 1.2 Hz frequency as it‚Äôs one of the most fundamental frequencies of our bodies (normal heartbeat) ‚Äì which is why people sleep soundly in trains. 9. The railways functions on an operating ratio of 94%, that is, it spends 94 paisa on every rupee that it earns. The amount of Rs. 4 saved from every Rs. 100 earned is minuscule and the revenues of the railways have been suffering because of the negligible revision of prices. 10. The diamond crossing (dubbed so by railways themselves), in Nagpur, is one-of-its-kind, from where trains go East, West, North and South. 11. The Indian Railways is constructing the world‚Äôs highest rail bridge over Chenab. The bridge will be 1,315 meters long and will use up to 25,000 tonnes of steel. The idea was initially conceived in 2008 but the project was paused due to safety concerns. The work, however, began in 2010 and it is expected to be completed this year. 12. The longest tunnel in the country is Pir Panjal Railway tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir which is 11.25 kms long. 13. The busiest junction in the country is Howrah junction in Kolkata with as many as 974 trains stopping there daily. 14. All the electric appliances (fans, lights) in rail coaches function at 110 volts instead of the Indian standard 220 volts. It is a very effective counter-measure against thieves! 15. The mascot for Indian Railways is Bholu, or Bholu the guard elephant, which was designed by National Institute of Design. It was unveiled on 16th April 2002. 16. The oldest working Indian locomotive still in use is the Fairy Queen, which worked with a steam engine. It was built in 1855. After retiring in 1909, it was relaunched in 1997 and operates as a tourist train between Delhi and Alwar. It travels at a speed 40 km/h. 17. The Indian Railways is the world‚Äôs eighth largest employer with a total of 1.4 million employees 18. Computerized reservations began in New Delhi in 1986. 19. Indian Railways launched an awareness campaign train on World AIDS Day, December 1, 2007, called the Red Ribbon Express. 20. India has eight Railway Museums ‚Äì in Delhi, Pune, Kanpur, Mysore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ghum and Tiruchirappalli. Out of these, the National Railway Museum in Delhi is the largest rail museum in Asia. 21. Indian Railways, a mode of transport that connects the whole nation, is the largest rail network in Asia and second largest in the world. 22.The New Delhi Railway Station has the world's largest Route Relay Interlocking System, an achievement that has won the station a place in the Guinness Book of Records. 23.Indian Railways (IR) carries over 25 million passengers daily which is perhaps more than the entire population of Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania put together. Annually Indian Railways ferries 7.2 billion passengers (nearly 6x India's current population). 24.The Indian Railways Catering & Tourism Corporation website is rather busy for it gets close to 12 lakh hits each minute. 25.The toilets found in Indian trains have always been a rather talked about feature but did you know that our trains got toilets only after Indian Railways completed about 50 years! 26. Indian Railways have always been the backbone of our country‚Äôs public transport system with 16 zones which cover a route of 65,808 km with 7,112 stations. 27.The Darjeeling toy train is still running on a steam engine that was made all the way back in 1881. 28.Longest station name: Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta on the Arakkonam-Renigunta section near Chennai. 29.Shortest station name: Ib, near Jharsuguda in Odisha and Od, near Anand in Gujarat. 30.The railway station of Navapur is built in two states; one half of it is in Maharashtra and the other half is in Gujarat. Even a train which halts at Navapur Railway station is stationed half in Maharashtra and half in Gujarat."},{"prompt":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","completion":"To tell you the truth I haven‚Äôt seen anything too horrible.

As opposed to, say, DU or maybe IISER?","completion":"Well B.Sc Mathematics both at Ashoka University and IISER Mohali is more or less the same and if a Student is coming from outside NCR or Punjab then he can go for either one as distance and locations would not matter much to him and the course structure and standards are also more or less the same. As for comparing DU with Ashoka or maybe IISER then these two institutes can never be near the top 3 colleges of DU ‚Äì Stephens, SRCC and LSR. These are similar in Brand & educational quality to Harvard & Stanford of USA and Oxford, Cambridge of UK. Ashoka or IISER will never ever be able to provide that same Brand & Students profile (even if they provide Academic rigor). Other than these 3 top colleges of DU Ashoka is better than any other DU college. Of course the fees still would be of some concern but if money is not the primary consideration then Ashoka would be a clear choice of preference. Multidisciplinary course curriculum in Ashoka and IISER give them an edge over DU especially in the professional courses. Also the faculty at Ashoka would be a notch better than the DU. Ashoka and IISER being private institutions have a reputation to be taken care of and take the placements very seriously. Special care is being given to groom the students for the final event ‚Äì the Placements. So from the trio of Ashoka, IISER and DU ‚Äì Ashoka and IISER have the edge on DU, of course the top 3 of DU (Stephens, SRCC & LSR) are not taken into consideration. But if someone asks me for my honest opinion about doing a B.Sc Maths in NCR then Ashoka and IISER are topped by Shiv Nadar (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be University). Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence (Deemed to be University) also located at Greater Noida is perhaps one of the best institutes offering world class professional courses in streams of Management, Engineering, Science with Maths. Some of the differentiating features of B.Sc Mathematics course at Shiv Nadar IoE are: The B.Sc Mathematics (research) program here is of international standards and very popular among the students aspiring to take up mathematical studies to become learned and qualified mathematicians.Shiv Nadar IoE offers a unique multidisciplinary B.Sc course offering foundation and major subjects at initial and later stages respectively, in the course curriculum.Faculty is top class and drawn from top universities across the globe.Shiv Nadar IoE also has excellent facilities both for learning and staying which are the best in the industry.Placements at Shiv Nadar IoE have always been very impressive being almost 100% in every placement drive. However, the placements in B.Sc Maths have been very few with most of the passing out students opting for higher studies.Students take pride in calling themselves as scholars of Shiv Nadar IoE. So, in my personal opinion Shiv Nadar IoE is a much better choice than Ashoka, IISER and DU for doing a B.Sc Maths."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function U(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"ü§îprompts chatüß†")])],-1)),t("div",C,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ‚úï ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(o(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,y)=>(o(),k(p,{key:y,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),a("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
