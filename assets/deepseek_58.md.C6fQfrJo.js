Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Source Code Movie plot: U.S. Army pilot Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), last aware of being on a mission in Afghanistan, wakes up on a commuter train[6] to Chicago, at 7:40 am. To the world around him â including his traveling partner Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) and the bathroom mirror â he appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard. Stevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit, leaking oil. Communicating through a video screen, Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) verifies Stevens' identity, and insists he stay \\"on mission\\" to find the bomber before a large \\"dirty bomb\\" hits downtown Chicago in six hours. Inside the \\"Source Code\\" experimental device designed by scientist Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person's life within an alternative timeline.[a] Stevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bomber's identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times he cannot locate or disarm the bomb and dies on the train. But Rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real. It is revealed that he has been \\"with them\\" for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan. He is comatose and missing most of his body, hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is in his imagination, his brain's way of making sense of a missing environment. A confused and frustrated Stevens asks, \\"As one soldier to another, am I dead?\\" Angry to learn that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission. Rutledge agrees. Stevens catches the bomber Derek Frost (Michael Arden), who leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death, and gets off at the last stop before Chicago. In one run-through, Frost kills both Fentress and Christina, and flees in a rented white van. Stevens remembers the license...

The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea. Answer:","completion":"The name of the person who was ill for several weeks in the article is Leopold Mozart, the father of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He was experiencing throat inflammation and other worrisome symptoms after a private performance at the Earl of Thanet's home in Grosvenor Square. The Mozart family relocated from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside at 180 Ebury Street, Chelsea, for the sake of Leopold's health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Andy Marles, of South Wales Fire Service, said slower 999 response times were likely within three or four years of next month's UK spending review. \\"It will get extremely difficult,\\" Mr Marles told BBC Radio Wales. The Welsh Assembly Government said that it was consulting with frontline workers to protect essential public services. Mr Marles explained that as 82% of the fire service's ??70m budget went on staffing costs, any significant reduction in budget would mean reducing the workforce. He said that in the event of cuts amounting to 3% year-on-year, the service would probably be able to manage for the first and second years by being \\"a bit smarter\\" in some of its processes and procedures. \\"But ultimately,\\" he added, \\"if this goes on into the third, fourth, fifth year, it'll be very, very difficult to maintain the number of fire engines and the resource and the community safety activity that we undertake now. \\"If the cuts are 25%, it will be impossible to maintain the service we do today in the third, fourth, year from now.\\" Mr Marles said the difference would not be dramatic in terms of how that would affect the service offered to someone dialling 999. \\"We'll still have fire engines,\\" he said. \\"We're not going to take all our fire engines out of the system. But there might be less fire engines. \\"We might be able to put one station where two exist now to be able to maintain the service to the public, but it may mean that attendance times are increased slightly. \\"But it will mean an increase, and every time we talk about changing fire stations, inevitably the public get quite upset about that and understandably so. \\"They expect the response they get now, which is minutes to house fires for the majority of our area.\\" The Welsh Assembly Government said it had been \\"pushing the UK Government hard\\" to recognise the vital importance of protecting essential front line services ahead of the Comprehensive Spending Review on 20 October. \\"We have made prudent assumptions in starting to prepare next year's draft budget, but it would be inappropriate to speculate on any impact the UK government's review may have on public services in Wales,\\" it said in a statement. The outcome of the review would be profoundly important for Wales, it added. \\"We are continuing to consult closely, openly and seriously with frontline workers and engaging with communities the length and breadth of Wales to ensure we work together to protect essential public services\\" said the statement. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Slower 999 response times might occur within three to four years after the UK spending review next month, according to Andy Marles of the South Wales Fire Service. He said that budget reductions would likely result in workforce reductions, as 82% of the fire service's £70m budget goes towards staffing costs. Although the service could potentially manage minor cuts by improving processes and procedures, more substantial cuts could make it difficult to maintain the current level of fire engines and community safety activities.

The Spanish sentence is also structured similarly to the original text, maintaining coherence and readability in the translation. Let's go through the translation step by step to better understand the choices made: 1. \\"Some politicians and people\\" is translated as \\"Algunos políticos y personas\\" – this maintains the subject of the sentence and the idea that not all politicians and people hold this opinion. 2. \\"have wanted\\" is translated as \\"han querido\\" – using the present perfect tense (\\"han\\") and the past participle of \\"querer\\" (\\"querido\\") to convey the idea of an ongoing desire or action in the past. 3. \\"to undermine us\\" is translated as \\"debilitarnos\\" – using the verb \\"debilitar\\" (to weaken, undermine) and the pronoun \\"nos\\" attached to it, indicating the action is being done to \\"us\\". 4. \\"calling us\\" is translated as \\"llamándonos\\" – using the gerund form of \\"llamar\\" (to call) and the pronoun \\"nos\\" attached to it, showing that \\"us\\" are being called something. 5. \\"warlike and violent\\" is translated as \\"belicosos y violentos\\" – using two adjectives that closely match the meaning of \\"warlike\\" (belicoso) and \\"violent\\" (violento) in Spanish.

John Rzeznik is the founder of the Music is Art Foundation . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"The two sentences are not direct paraphrases of each other, as they contain different information about John Rzeznik and Robby Takac's affiliations with their respective foundations. However, they are related in that both sentences discuss these musicians' involvement in charitable organizations. In the first sentence, you mentioned that John Rzeznik is an ambassador for the Save the Music Foundation of VH1, while Robby Takac is the founder of the Music is Art Foundation. This sentence highlights John Rzeznik's role as an ambassador which involves promoting and representing the Save the Music Foundation, an organization focused on restoring music programs in America's public schools. On the other hand, Robby Takac is presented as the founder of the Music is Art Foundation, meaning he established this organization that supports and promotes the importance of music and arts education. The second sentence flips the roles of these two artists, stating that Robby Takac is an ambassador for VH1's Save the Music Foundation and John Rzeznik is the founder of the Music is Art Foundation. This change in their roles is significant because it reshuffles the responsibilities and the level of involvement that John Rzeznik and Robby Takac have in these organizations. In conclusion, the two sentences are not strict paraphrases of each other since they convey different information about the roles of John Rzeznik and Robby Takac in their respective foundations.

Sentence 1: Iran says ready for fresh round of nuclear talks Sentence 2: Iran's Khamenei renews support for nuclear talks From 0 to 5 (0=\\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5=\\"means the same thing\\"), how similar are the two sentences?","completion":"The two sentences share a significant degree of similarity and contextual overlap. They are both about Iran's stance on nuclear talks. However, they are not identical either. The first sentence, \\"Iran says ready for fresh round of nuclear talks,\\" indicates a general readiness of Iran as a nation to participate in a new series of discussions about their nuclear program. This suggests an open and possibly proactive approach taken by the Iranian government towards international dialogue about its controversial nuclear enrichment activities. This statement could have been issued by any representative of the Iran government. The second sentence, \\"Iran's Khamenei renews support for nuclear talks,\\" goes more specific into identifying a key figure within the country, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, showing his individual support for such nuclear negotiations. This is important because as per the country's political structure, Khamenei's stances have significant influence over the country's international policies and initiatives. Therefore, while these sentences do not mean \\"the same thing\\" verbatim, they have substantial overlap of significance as they both convey Iran's openness towards nuclear talks. The difference lies in who, specifically, in Iran is expressing the readiness for these discussions. Hence, on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 signifying that both sentences mean exactly the same thing, and 0 indicating no overlap in meaning, these two sentences could potentially be rated around 3.5 to 4 due to the shared context of Iran's receptiveness to nuclear negotiations but shifting focus from general to specific authoritative figure's stance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Heathrow Airport, which is the busiest airport in the United Kingdom and one of the busiest in the world, is served by the London Underground network. Specifically, it is located on the Piccadilly Line. The Piccadilly Line is one of the 11 lines in the London Underground system, and it is recognized by its dark blue color on the tube maps. The Piccadilly Line connects Heathrow Airport to Central London and other important stations in the city, providing convenient and cost-effective transport for passengers traveling to and from the airport. The line includes three stations within the Heathrow complex: Heathrow Terminal 5, Heathrow Terminal 4, and Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3. Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 station serves both Terminal 2, which is Heathrow's Queen's Terminal, and Terminal 3, which is known for its shopping facilities. Heathrow Terminal 4 station serves Terminal 4, which mainly caters to long-haul and European flights. Finally, Heathrow Terminal 5 station is located in Terminal 5, which is the newest terminal, primarily used by British Airways and its partner airlines. A journey from Heathrow Airport to Central London on the Piccadilly Line takes approximately 45-60 minutes, depending on the destination and the time of day. Travelers can expect trains to run approximately every 3-10 minutes, with more frequent service during peak hours and less frequent service during off-peak hours or late in the evening. In addition to the London Underground, Heathrow Airport is also served by other transport options such as the Heathrow Express, an airport train service that connects the airport to Paddington Station in just 15 minutes, and the Heathrow Connect, which stops at local stations between Heathrow and Paddington. Furthermore, passengers can take advantage of buses, taxis, and private car services to get to and from the airport. It is important to note that, when taking the London Underground to reach Heathrow Airport, passengers should allow for sufficient travel time due to potential delays and to consider factors such as luggage, connection times, and walking distances within the airport terminals. Overall, the Piccadilly Line remains a convenient, affordable, and widely-used means of transport for travelers using Heathrow Airport."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Polyps usually reproduce asexually.

The almighty and above-the-law organization is called FRAT and guess what? they've got a kick-ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects, girlfriends, you name it.

Context: Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

However, the surface of each piece is very rough and can give you a splinter or two while assembling it or lifting the piece to move it. The overall appearance is good, but close up one can see that the wood stain is very inconsistant. For this price, however, I still recommend it. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review can be characterized as mixed, with both positive and negative elements. On one hand, the reviewer appreciates the aesthetics and functionality of the lounge, mentioning its nice appearance, comfort, and the convenience of the slide-out side table. These aspects of the review project a positive tone towards the product. On the other hand, the reviewer also points out several negative aspects. They mention the rough surface which can cause splinters during assembly or when moving the piece, and the inconsistency in the wood stain affecting the lounge's appearance upon closer inspection. These criticisms reflect a negative tone towards certain aspects of the product. However, it is important to note that despite these negative aspects, the reviewer still recommends the product due to its comparatively lower price. This suggests that the reviewer believes that the positive features outweigh the negative ones, or at least that the negatives are tolerable given the product's overall value for money. Therefore, while the review has both positive and negative elements, the overall tone can be considered slightly more positive since the reviewer ultimately recommends the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Part #1: Identifying the presence of two dialogues. Usage: Dialogue 1: 'from here don't you mean from there to here get ur fuckin ass otta here'. Dialogue 2: 'u awake yes why c im feeling low '. Here, we can see that there are two dialogues mentioned in the task. The task is to determine if they have the same underlying emotion. Part #2: Recognizing the possible emotions. Usage: The possible emotions are happy, sad, angry, or other. This part informs us that we have to consider four emotions when comparing the two dialogues. This provides a context to evaluate the emotional aspects of the given dialogues. Part #3: Evaluating the emotions of both dialogues. Usage: Dialogue 1: 'from here don't you mean from there to here get ur fuckin ass otta here'. (Angry emotion due to aggressive language) In this dialogue, the speaker seems to be angry and frustrated, using strong language to express their dissatisfaction. The emotional component of this dialogue matches the 'angry' emotion. Part #4: Comparing the emotions of both dialogues. Usage: Dialogue 1: Angry emotion, Dialogue 2: 'u awake yes why c im feeling low '. (Sad emotion due to feeling low) Dialogue 2 contains an expression of sadness or feeling low. By comparing the emotions from both dialogues, we can determine if they have the same underlying emotion. Part #5: Providing the final output. Usage: Do the dialogues have the same underlying emotion? 'Angry' and 'Sad' are different emotions, so the answer is 'no'. The final part of the task requires providing a 'yes' or 'no' answer based on whether both dialogues have the same underlying emotion. In this case, the emotions between the two dialogues are different – one is angry, and the other is sad – so the output is 'no'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(b). No. Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"cells are organized into tissues to what?\\" is \\"allow growth\\", given that cells are organized into tissues become functional units? A:","completion":"Based on the options provided, it would not be accurate to simply answer \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" in this case. Rather, the question requires a more in-depth explanation and understanding of the topic of cellular organization. So, do I think that the right answer to the question \\"cells are organized into tissues to what?\\" is \\"allow growth\\", given that cells are organized into tissues become functional units? Here is a detailed response: In multicellular organisms, cells are indeed organized into tissues. This organization offers a higher level of structure and function that could not be accomplished by individual cells alone. Tissues can be defined as groups of cells that work together to perform a specific function. They exhibit a close-knit structure and often engage in cooperative interactions. While growth is an essential aspect of the organization of cells into tissues, it is not the sole purpose. Cells are organized into tissues for several reasons, which can be discussed under the following headings: 1. Structural support: Tissues provide the structural framework necessary for the organism's body. They hold and cement various organs and body parts together—for instance, connective tissue like cartilage, bones, and tendons. These tissues contribute to maintaining the overall shape and integrity of the organism. 2. Facilitating specialized functions: The organization of cells into tissues allows for the performance of specialized functions. For example, muscle tissue is made up of muscle cells that contract and relax, enabling movement. Similarly, neural tissue comprises nerve cells (neurons), allowing for the transmission of nerve impulses throughout the body. 3. Efficient resource allocation and distribution: By organizing cells into tissues, multicellular organisms can effectively allocate, distribute, and share resources, such as nutrients and oxygen. This organization also aids in waste removal and helps maintain the internal environment of the organism. 4. Enhanced communication and coordination: The organization of cells into tissues allows for better communication and coordination between cells. This organization is crucial for the proper functioning of the organism's systems. For instance, the heart muscle cells must contract in sync to support an appropriate blood flow. 5. Growth and development: The organization of cells into tissues does, indeed, contribute to growth, as cells can now replicate and specialize in a coordinated manner to support the development and maturation of multicellular organisms. This process enables an organism to grow and repair damaged tissue as needed. In conclusion, while growth is an important aspect of the organization of cells into tissues, it does not solely define the purpose of this phenomenon. Cells are organized into tissues for diverse reasons, including structural support, specialized functions, enhanced coordination, and efficient resource management."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If everyone has a car and drives anywhere they want to go, there will be serious traffic problems on the road. Luckily, trains are a good form of public transport. British people use trains a lot. This is especially so for people who are travelling from London to Paris. Every day about 20 trains leave London. They travel at a very high speed and people feel glad that the trains take only 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach Paris. It's much faster to travel by train than by bus or by car. This is because people have to drive cars or buses very carefully and lowly for many reasons, such as speed limits and traffic jams. However, when you are travelling by train, the speed is almost the same and there is no traffic jam for a train. Besides, Londoners think taking a train is one of the safest ways of travelling on the ground. Trains take quite a number of quality tests while they are made. More importantly, they have to take many safety checks before they are used on the rail track. What's more, trains in Britain are comfortable and provide fine services for their users. When you are on a London train, you will find that the train has comfortable tables and seats where people can sit. They also provide food services and power plugs for personal computers or mobile phone. A:","completion":"Which of the following statements about train travel between London and Paris is true?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The energy minister rejected claims she had embellished details of her 25-year career in finance. She also said she was \\"disappointed\\" at attempts by opponents to block her from the final ballot. \\"I just want an honourable campaign,\\" she told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Mrs Leadsom is up against Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Michael Gove, with the result on 9 September. One of them will be forced to drop out when the result is announced later, with the remaining two to go forward to a vote of the membership. The winner will become Britain's next prime minister. Mrs Leadsom's team has published a summary of her CV, after it was claimed - including by a former colleague - that her previous jobs were not as she had described them. \\"I have not changed my CV,\\" she told the BBC as MPs voted in their final ballot of the leadership contest. There have been claims of underhand tactics in the Tory leadership contest, after it emerged that Justice Secretary Michael Gove's campaign manager had appealed to Mrs May's supporters to unite in an effort to block Mrs Leadsom's chances of getting on to the final ballot. Nick Boles sent a text message to a number of MPs who support Mrs May, urging them to switch sides and back Mr Gove. He said that although he thought it \\"overwhelmingly likely\\" the home secretary would win the contest, he was \\"seriously frightened about the risk\\" of Mrs Leadsom ending up in the run-off. \\"What if Theresa stumbles? Are we really confident that the membership won't vote for a fresh face who shares their attitudes about much of modern life, like they did with IDS?\\" he wrote, referring to Iain Duncan Smith's election as Conservative leader in 2001. He later issued an apology and said Mr Gove had been unaware of the plot. Mrs May's campaign said MPs who wanted her as prime minister had to vote for her, adding: \\"There can be no space for tactical voting - this contest is simply too important to be playing games about who goes forward to the membership.\\" In her BBC interview, Mrs Leadsom said: \\"I am really not interested in other people's tactics, or whatever. \\"I just want an honourable campaign.\\" She said Mr Boles's text message did not bother her, because it was \\"not honourable\\", adding: \\"One of the things I would hope to do as prime minister is to change that from the top by setting an example.\\" Setting out her vision for the country in a speech earlier, Mrs Leadsom said she wanted to \\"spread prosperity to every corner of our country\\". And she told BBC Radio 4's World at One that on becoming prime minister she would act quickly to \\"take back control of immigration\\". Although other EU nationals would still be able to move to live and work in the UK until the UK leaves the EU, she said only those who were already in the UK at around the time she became PM would have the right to stay after Brexit. The leadership ballot takes place between 09:00 and 16:00 BST, with the results to be announced shortly afterwards. A growing group of Conservative MPs are calling for the contest to be accelerated with a result before 9 September. By John Pienaar, deputy political editor By tonight, there'll be two contenders left. Theresa May's the bookies' favourite. She's been called a \\"bloody difficult woman\\" but also good at her job. That's an insult she can live with, but they'll likely get harsher. Michael Gove's hindered by his new-found notoriety as the best-mannered assassin at Westminster, after backing, then burying, Boris Johnson's dreams. Last night, it emerged Mr Gove's campaign manager had appealed - unsubtly - to Theresa May's supporters to unite in an effort to kill off his fellow EU Leave campaigner Andrea Leadsom's chances. He later apologised. Devoid of top-level political experience, she's already having to overcome doubts about her claim to have been a financial high-flyer. A former colleague at investment firm Invesco Perpetual, Robert Stephens, has said \\"she didn't manage any teams, large or small and certainly did not manage any funds.\\" That was after a friendly MP, Bernard Jenkin, spoke of her history managing \\"hundreds of people and billions of pounds\\". A CV listing the post Financial Institutions Director at Barclays later added the word \\"deputy\\". An innocent error, according to Team Leadsom - and the MP who'd boasted of her high-powered background had merely been \\"bigging her up\\". Maybe so, but the contest will be merciless. The fight for the top job in politics always is. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - who is supporting Mrs Leadsom - warned colleagues against spending \\"the whole time stabbing each other in the back\\". At a hustings on Wednesday night, Mrs Leadsom restated that she would not publish her tax return - unlike Mrs May and Mr Gove - unless she made the final two, saying she did not want to set a \\"precedent\\". But Mrs Leadsom told MPs they could come to see a summary of her tax affairs personally if they wanted to. Despite Mrs May's clear lead in Tuesday's first round vote - she got 165 votes of 329 cast - the home secretary has said she does not want the contest to be a \\"coronation\\". The leadership contest has been sparked by David Cameron's decision to step down as leader and prime minister after the UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU. 1984 - 85 Canadian / Chinese Corporate Finance Company: Junior Support 1985 - 87 EF Hutton: Trainee Broker, London Metals Exchange 1997 - 99 - De Putron Fund Management: Managing director 1999 - 2009 - Invesco Perpetual: Senior investment officer and head of corporate governance Summary:","completion":"Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom is up against Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Michael Gove to become Britain's next Prime Minister, with one of them forced to drop out when the result gets announced later, leaving the remaining two to go to the final vote."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the questions at the end based on the text. Washington (CNN) -- The Virginia governor's race has often been looked to as an off-year barometer of national political sentiment. This year's grind-it-out race, an acrimonious spitball contest between two candidates only slightly more likeable than Walter White, is anything but. In a lesser-of-two-evils campaign, Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Democratic fundraiser and confidante to former President Bill Clinton, is clinging to a modest but sturdy lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general. Republicans have pilloried McAuliffe as a sleazy political operator and failed businessman who exploited his Washington connections to help his sputtering car company, GreenTech Automotive. Cuccinelli has been targeted as a far-right social crusader who would curb abortion rights and access to contraception. Democrats on Twitter are fond of calling him #creepyken. McAuliffe is leading Cuccinelli among likely voters by an eight-point margin, 47% to 39%, according to a Washington Post poll out this week. McAuliffe is hardly bulletproof: A federal investigation into GreenTech has sullied his reputation, and only two-thirds of Democrats -- his own party -- consider him \\"honest and trustworthy.\\" But Cuccinelli is on much shakier ground. While Republicans are slightly more fired up about voting for him than Democrats are for McAuliffe, Cuccinelli's favorable ratings are next-to-toxic: More than half of likely voters view him unfavorably. Enter Robert Sarvis. As public dismay with the two main candidates calcifies, the baby-faced 37-year old Libertarian candidate from Fairfax has quietly crept northward in the polls, reaching 10% in the Post poll. That's not nearly enough to win in November -- with just five weeks until Election Day, even Sarvis admits \\"we have to get a lot higher\\" -- but he looks increasingly likely to play the role of spoiler by siphoning conservative votes away from Cuccinelli. 1.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. What does Buhari think about Trump?

A spray tan is like a magic mist that makes our skin look like we have been playing in the sun. But we need to know how to look after it, so our skin stays nice and pretty. Here are some easy steps to follow: 1. Let the spray dry: After getting a spray tan, we need to wait for it to dry completely on our skin. Think of it like paint that needs to dry - if you touch it too soon, you might smudge it! 2. No showering or sweaty activities for 8 hours: Just like waiting for paint to dry, we should avoid getting our skin wet by showering or playing games that make us sweat a lot. This will keep our spray tan looking perfect! 3. Take your first shower: After waiting 8 hours, we can take our first shower. This will help wash off any extra spray tan that didn't stick to our skin. 4. Moisturize your skin: Our skin needs to stay soft and smooth. We can do this by using a lotion or cream to keep it moisturized. This also helps our spray tan last longer! 5. Say no to chlorine: We might want to swim in a pool, but the water has something called chlorine that can make our spray tan fade quickly. It's best to avoid pools with chlorine for a few days. 6. Exercise in moderation: Working out is good for us, but if we do too much after getting a spray tan, we might sweat too much. This can also make the spray tan fade. Let's exercise just enough to stay healthy, but not too much! 7. Avoid spa treatments and products: Spa treatments, like fancy lotions and scrubs, can also make our spray tan fade. So, try not to use those while your spray tan is still fresh. 8. Apply self-tanner: If you want to keep your skin looking sun-kissed and pretty, you can use something called a self-tanner. It's like a magic lotion that helps us keep the pretty color longer. So, those are the steps to take care of our skin after using a spray tan! Just follow them, and you'll keep your skin looking lovely and sun-kissed. Remember to always be gentle with your skin, because it is very precious.

The Sultan, a doting father, is obsessed with ensuring her safety, installing the highest precautions to prevent her honor from being compromised. One fateful day, the prince of a neighboring kingdom, Prince Hamza arrives in Andalus for a diplomatic visit. He spends his days feasting and attending important meetings to establish an alliance between their nations. While exploring the bustling palace, he happens upon a secret passageway hidden behind a wall tapestry. Intrigued, he ventures into the darkness and follows the dimly lit tunnel, which eventually leads to the Sultan's royal bathing house. Prince Hamza is amazed by the sight that unfolds in front of him: sunlight streaming through an aperture in the ceiling, casting its rays on the clear waters of the bathing pool below. Among the sweet fragrances of scented oils and the gentle splashing of water, he becomes bewitched by the sight of the beautiful Princess Yasmine, completely unaware of her identity and the gravity of the situation.

When the two young royals meet face-to-face, they see an undeniable spark between them, though they dare not mention it out loud.

The Sultan, who cares deeply for his daughter, proposes a challenge to Prince Hamza: if he can complete three impossible tasks within one moon cycle, he will be granted his life and allowed to marry Yasmine to solidify their realms' alliance.

Google, one of the biggest U.S. companies, is trying to find it out. The company has already found \\"a close connection between color and satisfaction with a person's work area\\". That's according to its spokeswoman named Meghan Casserly. \\"Color is a silent salesperson,\\" said Elyria Kemp. She is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of New Orleans. Kemp is following color trends in business. She is studying the connection between feelings and color. According to Kemp, when people make an evaluation of a product, usually they do this within 90 seconds or less. Besides, more than half of their first evaluation is based on (......) color alone. That's why so many companies are researching their color choices. They are spending thousands of dollars on the research, too. Just think of UPS's Pullman brown, Home Depot's orange and Tiffany & Co.'s blue. Joclyn Benedetto is a spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. She said the success of the company's jewelry was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap every product. She said the color was chosen by the founder Charles Lewis Tiffany for the cover of Blue Book, Tiffany's annual collection of beautifully hand-made jewels, which first came out in 1845. Coca-Cola's red color also dates back more than 100 years. The soft drink was shipped in barrels painted red. A spokesperson for Home Depot said research showed that the first thing people thought of was orange when they heard the name of the company. Smaller companies are also realizing the importance of color. But picking the right color is important. \\"You know when something is right because you get a feeling of safety, and it's not something that you think about. It just will hit you,\\" said Emil Hagopian, a distributor for Mar Plast Color Building Accessories in Ann Arbor, Mich. \\"And sometimes, if it's done wrong, that also hits you.\\" Question: What do we know about Tiffany & Co. according to the passage? - It only sells women's clothes. - Blue is its owner's favorite color. - Its products are wrapped in blue. - Its red color dates back over 100 years.

I’m dorky and like to use little proverbs all the time. One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats.

Why is Ram Gopal Verma casting her again and again ? 5) Mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie. 7) Legendry role played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some Gangu Mummy.

He is an aspiring writer, constantly searching for captivating stories to write about. The setting is primarily focused on the apartment building and its laundry room. Step 2: Introduce supporting characters LaRoche, a mysterious character found in the laundry room, will play a significant role in the plot. Additionally, we have Amy, the apartment building's manager, and a group of neighbors who reside in the same building as Charles, including an eccentric elderly woman named Mrs. Thompson. Step 3: Establish the initial incident One gloomy Friday evening, Charles heads down to the laundry room to do his weekly laundry. As he enters, he unexpectedly discovers a tall man, LaRoche, silently standing in the corner staring at the washing machines. Charles senses something odd about the situation and decides to investigate further. Step 4: Develop the plot twist As Charles begins to engage LaRoche in conversation, he realizes that the man claims to be from a secret government agency investigating the disappearance of multiple residents within the apartment building. Furthermore, LaRoche divulges that the laundry room potentially holds a hidden entrance to an underground facility involved in nefarious activities. Step 5: Rising action Charles and LaRoche decide to join forces and attempt to uncover the truth about the mysterious underground facility while trying to maintain their cover among the residents of the apartment building. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they garner information from various neighbors, such as pieces of conversation from Mrs. Thompson about odd occurrences and strange noises coming from the laundry room.

The troubled starlet joined friends -- including actor Emile Hirsch -- at Lexington Social House by 11:00pm local time Wednesday.

DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse.

What is the solution?","completion":"Alright, let's break down this math problem step-by-step, as if I'm explaining it to a five-year-old. We have a math problem that looks like this: 7575 * i = -7563 * i + 15155 * i + 1445 First, let's look at the problem. We are trying to find the value of \\"i\\". Do you see the letter \\"i\\" in the problem? Now, let's gather all the \\"i\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, we need to add 7563 * i to both sides of the equation. When we do that, the problem will look like this: (7575 + 7563) * i = 15155 * i + 1445 Now let's add 7575 and 7563 together. Can you do that? That's right! When we add them, we get 15138. So the problem becomes: 15138 * i = 15155 * i + 1445 Next, we want to get rid of the \\"i\\" terms on the right side. To do that, we can subtract 15138 * i from both sides of the equation. When we do that, it will look like this: 0 = (15155 - 15138) * i + 1445 Now, let's subtract 15138 from 15155. Can you do that? Great! When we subtract those two numbers, we get 17. So our problem becomes: 0 = 17 * i + 1445 Now, we want to get \\"i\\" by itself. So, we need to subtract 1445 from both sides. It will look like this: -1445 = 17 * i Now, to find \\"i\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by 17. When we do that, we get: i = -85 So, the solution to the problem is i = -85.

The over-heated plot of \\"Bonjour tristesse\\" is taken from a juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan, which became a best-seller, though God knows why. For teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal. Don't be taken in by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr the step-mother-in- prospect. Unfortunately, too much rests on the frail shoulders of Jean Seberg. She's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's St. Joan -- Seberg's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film. This movie, also by Preminger, fulfills the \\"promise\\" of the first. It was her second movie; she was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of acting capacity? Not a chance?

It didn't take me long to figure out where I had made the wrong turn. I had tried following my memory instead of Luna's directions and wound up about eighty miles off course. My gas tank was pushing 'E' but fortunately the service station was open. When I stepped out of my Jeep, I could feel the soles of my boots melt on the asphalt. The heat coming off the cracked and pitted cement peeled off in waves that rolled out in every endless direction. The barren mountains in the distance looked unstable, like I was looking at them through a window pane slicked with olive oil. I slogged my way over to the gas pump and wrapped my shirt around the handle to keep my skin from burning against the desert-baked metal. The heat was so great I worried the fumes would ignite. A dirty round man stood in the shadowy doorway of the ramshackle service station and stared at me while he rubbed his hands inside an oily red rag. The oval name-patch stitched to his coveralls was loose at one end and curled like a leaf in the heat. His name was Jack. I topped off the tank and then walked over to him. \\"You work here?\\" I knew it was a stupid question the second it left my mouth. He and I were the only living things for fifty miles in any direction. Who the hell else would be working here? \\"Who the hell else would be working here?\\" he said. I shrugged my shoulders and pulled out my wallet. Jack wobbled inside behind a glass counter filled with everything from belt buckles to oil funnels. \\"That your momma's car?\\" he asked. It's impossible to tell what kind of psychological impact this heat would have on a man who lived out here alone, but I was sure it wasn't positive. Question: Where is the narrator?

In other words, while we know where he wrote his first book, the exact age at which he wrote it is not stated. The statement in question specifically asks if Paolini wrote his first book when he was 20 years old. As the paragraph does not give precise timing or age at which he wrote his first book, we cannot conclusively verify or refute this statement. For context, looking at Paolini's biography, we find that \\"Eragon\\", his first book, was published when he was 19 years old.

Daily Mail Reporter. Jobless people are being offered a course on how to 'design your own tattoo' - paid for by taxpayers. The free sessions on tattoo art paid for by the Labour-run Welsh Government's anti-poverty programme was yesterday blasted as a 'waste of public money'. The skin ink sessions for the unemployed are described a 'free fun interactive course that will develop your artistic skills to be able to design tattoos for yourself and others'. Scroll down for video. A free course for the unemployed on tattoo design has been attacked as a waste of public money (pictured a tattoo artist at work at the London Tattoo Convention on model Lexy Hell) The six-hour course is being run at a series of venues around Bridgend, South Wales, as part of a publicly-funded Communities First scheme to help people get back to work. But leading Lib-Dem Welsh Assembly member Peter Black hit out at the tattoo courses - and said it shows the job-creation scheme is a flop. He said: 'It is difficult to see how this venture can be justified. 'This important regeneration programme is not delivering what is expected of it and now we see it being reduced to fun tattoo design classes.' The Labour Welsh Government has spent around more than £200million on the Communities First scheme over the last ten years - but did not disclose how much is spent on the tattoo course. Mr Black said: 'Tens of millions of pounds have been spent on Communities First over the last decade or so but what indicators that are available show that in employment, health and education terms this money has had little impact. 'The Government needs to revisit how they are spending this money so as to deliver the results we need in helping deprived communities back to work.' The tattoo sessions are being held for free at community centres in Caerau, Cornelly and Sarn areas of Bridgend later this month. The six-hour course is part of a publicly-funded Communities First scheme to help get people back to work. It is aimed to 'support people to acquire the appropriate skills to become job-ready and gain sustainable employment.' A spokesman for Communities and Tackling Poverty Minister Jeff Cuthbert hit back by dubbing the attack as 'snobbish and grossly misleading'. He said: 'The Work Programme publicises the fact that it has found work for young people in this growing industry - is Mr Black complaining about these jobs?' 'The truth is he has seen one advert about one small project in one Communities First area and run to the press without first making proper enquiries about the facts of the matter.' A spokesman for Bridgend council said: 'The \\"Design your own tattoo\\" session should not be taken at face value. 'It is carefully structured to help people develop confidence and important skills in areas such as communication, creative thinking and working with others.'

Pick from: (I) Drink grape juice to get rid f the cough.. (II) Drink pineapple juice to get rid f the cough.....I think the answer is","completion":"To determine the most effective method for getting rid of coughs, we need to analyze the potential benefits of each option and the available supporting evidence. Step 1: Research potential benefits of grape juice for coughs Upon researching, grape juice does not show any significant properties that may specifically help with cough reduction. It contains vitamins and antioxidants, which can support overall health, but does not appear to be a direct cough remedy. Step 2: Research potential benefits of pineapple juice for coughs Pineapple juice contains bromelain, an enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce the severity of coughs and potentially break down mucus. Bromelain is not found in other commonly consumed fruits, making pineapple juice a unique choice for this task. Step 3: Compare the options and draw a conclusion Comparing the two options, it seems that pineapple juice is more likely to be effective at getting rid of coughs than grape juice. Pineapple juice contains bromelain, which has specific anti-inflammatory properties that can help with coughs, while grape juice does not have any specific properties that target coughs directly. So, the more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of using something more effective at getting rid of coughs than cough syrup is: (II) Drink pineapple juice to get rid of the cough."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US.

We have: 3260 * h + 1995 = 683 * h - 77892 Now, to find h, we must isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by subtracting 683 * h from both sides. This will remove h from the right side: (3260 * h - 683 * h) + 1995 = -77892 Now, subtract 683 from 3260: 2577 * h + 1995 = -77892 Next, we need to move 1995 to the other side by subtracting 1995 from both sides: 2577 * h = -77892 - 1995 Now, subtract 1995 from -77892: 2577 * h = -79887 Finally, we must divide by 2577 on both sides to find h: h = -79887 / 2577 Now, when we do that calculation: h ≈ -30.997 So h is approximately -30.997!

Q: Passage: The Panthers looked to stay hot and undefeated as they traveled to MetLife Stadium to take on the Giants, led by two-time Super Bowl winning QB Eli Manning and star WR Odell Beckham Jr., who both had strong performances in a Monday Night shootout at Miami a week earlier. Much of the game was overshadowed by Beckham's and Josh Norman's melees throughout the game, which would lead to Beckham being suspended the following week and both players receiving fines. Carolina led 35-7 late in the third quarter, but the Manning-led Giants stormed back with four touchdowns (the last of which was a pass to Beckham) to tie the game with just under two minutes remaining. Carolina responded by putting together a quick drive that concluded with a game-winning field goal on the final play of regulation. With the last-second win, the Panthers moved to 14-0 and set a new record for the most wins to start a season by an NFC team.

Question: Newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell is forced to attend college by whom? Movie title: Pitch Perfect Movie plot: At a 2011 national a cappella competition, Barden University's all-female a cappella group, the Barden Bellas, perform well until Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp) vomits on stage during her solo. They are publicly humiliated, losing the competition. Four months later, newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick) has no desire to attend college, but she is forced to do so by her father (John Benjamin Hickey), a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship. Wishing she could instead pursue a career as a music producer in Los Angeles, Beca spends her time making mash-up mixes of songs and takes up an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson (Skylar Astin). When Beca's father discovers she has not been attending classes, he comes to her with a proposition: if she joins a club and still does not want to remain at college after one year, he will allow her to leave college, and he will pay for Beca to move to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. After some persuasion from Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow) the co-leader of the Bellas along with Aubrey, she reluctantly joins the Barden Bellas. Aubrey does not initially approve of recruiting Beca, but yields nonetheless due to a desperate need for members and Beca's talent. Beca joins alongside a group of other women who do not fit the Bellas' typical mold: Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean), Stacie Conrad (Alexis Knapp), Lilly Onakuramara (Hana Mae Lee), and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Jesse is also revealed to have joined the Bellas' all-male rival group, the Treblemakers, but his roommate Benji was rejected after being called \\"weird\\" by Bumper. The Bellas participate in the southeastern regional competition at Carolina University where, at Aubrey's insistence, they perform the same medley that helped the Bellas advance to the finals the previous year. In spite of their old set list, the group manages to place second, which sends them to the semi-finals. Unfortunately, disaster strikes for Beca...

Two football players, Skip (Nicolas de Toth) and Ronny (Rawley Valverde) are amongst the partygoers for the week-long festivities. While Spring Break is occurring, a mysterious biker appears and begins to dispatch people. The back of his bike has a lever that when pulled (combined with a button pushed by the biker) causes the victim to undergo a treatment similar to the electric chair. When Ronny ends up a victim of the mysterious killer, Skip attempts to find Ronny with the help of Gail, who works as a bartender during Spring Break. The duo soon find Ronny and learn that local police chief Strycher (John Saxon) and physician Doc Willet (Michael Parks) have covered up Ronny's death in order for the partygoers not to worry. However, as the body count rises, Gail and Skip begin to wonder if Diablo made good on his promise to return from the dead or is someone else responsible. A confrontation at a local tire yard between Gail and the biker reveals that the killer is Reverend Bates (Lance Le Gault), who thinks Spring Break is nothing more than an excuse for sins.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. I am facing a new situation today: After working out in the yard for the day doing various chores, Karen comes back inside to prepare for a shower. While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which arm's blood vessels are more dilated? Answer:","completion":"The blood vessels in Karen's right arm are more dilated. Justification: In the provided context, the cut on Karen's right arm is described as red and easy to see, whereas the cut on her left arm is hardly noticeable. According to the background information, redness and visibility of a cut or injury are the results of inflammation which causes dilation, or expansion, of blood vessels. It specifically mentions that \\"The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm.\\" Therefore, based on these observations and the information provided, it can be inferred that the blood vessels in Karen's right arm, around the area of the noticeable cut, are more dilated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When Erin sneezed they used a handkerchief to cover their nose but Jennifer didn't ,so dad praised Choices: * Erin highly.. * Jennifer highly..","completion":"When Erin sneezed, they used a handkerchief to cover their nose, but Jennifer didn't, so dad praised Erin highly. In this scenario, it is evident that Erin demonstrates responsible and hygienic behavior by using a handkerchief when they sneezed, which helps prevent the spread of germs and viruses. This act of consideration towards their surroundings and the people around them is something worthy of praise. On the other hand, Jennifer failed to follow a similar practice, as she didn't cover her nose when she sneezed. This is considered inconsiderate and could potentially lead to the spread of germs and viruses. The father, in this situation, acknowledges Erin's responsible behavior by praising them highly. This could serve a dual purpose — not only does it reward Erin for exhibiting good manners and adhering to hygienic practices, but it also acts as an indirect reminder or lesson for Jennifer to follow suit and adapt her behavior accordingly. The scenario described in the sentence portrays the importance of teaching children about basic hygiene practices, as well as the significance of acknowledging and appreciating their efforts.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose family had strong left-wing political commitments? is inside the article: Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan..., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"The first name of the person whose family had strong left-wing political commitments is Suze. Suze Rotolo was Bob Dylan's girlfriend at the time, and her family's political commitments influenced Dylan's songwriting. Both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party, and Suze's beliefs and ideals inspired Dylan to explore and incorporate political themes in his lyrics.

In the first quarter, the Bears scored first on a Robbie Gould 32-yard field goal, though Jacksonville would respond in the next quarter on Josh Scobee's 31-yard kick. In the second half, the Bears broke the deadlock by kicking another field goal and cornerback Charles Tillman returning a Blaine Gabbert interception 36 yards for a touchdown, breaking former Bears safety Mike Brown's franchise record for the most pick-sixes in a career. Tillman also tied Donnell Woolford for the most interceptions by a cornerback in team history. In the fourth quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 10-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Chicago would then extend their lead on Cutler's 24-yard pass to Brandon Marshall to increase the lead to 27-3. Bears linebacker Lance Briggs would then intercept Gabbert and score on a 36-yard return. Briggs and Tillman would become the first pair in league history to return interceptions for touchdowns in consecutive games, and the Bears became the first team in NFL history to return five interceptions for touchdowns in the first five games of a season. The Bears would close out the game with backup running back Armando Allen scoring on a 46-yard touchdown run. The victory improved the team's record to 4-1. The victory is the most lopsided win for the Bears since their 1985 44-0 victory over the Cowboys, and the 38 points scored in the second half are the most since the team scoring 49 second half points in the 1941 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

As technology advances and consumer behavior shifts, advertisers adapt and grow their strategies to stay relevant. While some have gone as far as claiming that advertising is dying amidst this constant change, this statement couldn't be further from the truth. Advertising is far from dead, but the market is changing in unprecedented ways. Here, we explore the current state of advertising and its trajectory in the ever-evolving digital landscape. The Prominence of Digital Advertising Step 1 - Highlight the growth of digital advertising To illustrate the changing landscape, one must first look at the rapid growth of digital advertising. With the arrival of smartphones, social media, and online video platforms, a significant portion of advertising budgets have shifted towards digital channels. Not only does digital advertising offer more targeted and personalized experiences, but it also provides richer data and analytics for advertisers to develop even more effective campaigns. The Rise of Native Advertising and Sponsored Content Step 2 - Discuss the rise of native advertising and sponsored content In the current digital landscape, consumers are increasingly resistant to traditional display ads. As a result, the rise of native advertising and sponsored content has taken center stage. By blending into a publisher's content feed and providing value to users through engaging stories, these non-intrusive ads effectively reach target audiences. The Importance of Influencer Marketing Step 3 - Talk about the role of influencer marketing in the advertising landscape Influencer marketing is an increasingly important pillar in the advertising industry. This trend leverages the popularity and credibility of individuals, such as celebrities, YouTube stars, or bloggers, to promote products or services through their social media channels. The modern consumer values authenticity, and influencer marketing enables brands to connect with customers on a more personal level. The Shift Towards Programmatic Advertising Step 4 - Expound on the shift towards programmatic advertising The automation of media buying and selling through programmatic advertising is changing the game for advertisers. This technology-driven approach provides better targeting, real-time analytics, and cost efficiency. The flexibility it offers allows advertisers to take a more sophisticated approach to reach specific audience segments. The Prevalence of Ad Blockers and the Fight for Attention Step 5 - Address the challenge of ad blockers and strategies to overcome them With ad blockers becoming more prevalent, advertisers face the difficult challenge of reaching audiences while respecting their preferences. It has given rise to new methods of ad delivery, incentive-based models, and greater focus on creating engaging, non-intrusive content. This shift further underscores the need for advertisers to be innovative and adapt to the changing environment. Conclusion As the world shifts towards a more digital-heavy landscape, the advertising industry is undergoing a metamorphosis. Digital advertising, native ads, influencer marketing, programmatic advertising, and the rise of ad blockers are just a few examples of how the market is changing. In the face of these challenges and opportunities, advertisers must be agile and innovative, constantly adapting their strategies to stay ahead. Advertising may be evolving, but it is far from dead. In fact, the market is alive and thriving, with new opportunities emerging throughout every corner of the digital landscape."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period. The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500–1400) and the Renaissance (1400–1600) eras; the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820), and Romantic eras (1804–1910); and the 20th century (1901–2000) which includes the modern (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary or postmodern (1975–2015) eras.[citation needed] What time period is known at the common practice period?

Q:Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells. This abnormality is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, which is a very serious condition. Pete and Mike were two brothers. Pete had no health problems, while Mike inherited the sickle cell trait. Mike had adjacent health problems. Which brother didn't have molecules of hemoglobin that aggregate? A:","completion":"The brother who did not have molecules of hemoglobin that aggregate was Pete. In the given information, it was mentioned that Pete had no health problems. This implies that Pete did not inherit the gene for sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease from his parents, thus resulting in the normal functioning of his hemoglobin. Hemoglobin, a protein molecule located in red blood cells, is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. In its normal form, it does not aggregate or clump together. On the other hand, Mike, who inherited the sickle cell trait, had some of his hemoglobin functioning as Hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin S is an abnormal form of hemoglobin, caused by a genetic mutation, that tends to aggregate under certain conditions such as low oxygen levels. This aggregation deforms the red blood cells into a sickle or crescent shape, which can cause a variety of health problems. Sickle cell trait is when a person inherits the gene for hemoglobin S from one parent, while the other parent provides a gene for normal hemoglobin. So, while a percentage of Mike's hemoglobin is Hemoglobin S and can aggregate, not all his hemoglobin is abnormal. This usually results in fewer symptoms compared to sickle cell disease, which occurs when a person inherits two genes for Hemoglobin S. However, it's mentioned that Mike had adjacent health problems, which could possibly be linked to this trait, depending on their nature and severity. But in direct answer to the question, the brother whose hemoglobin did not aggregate was Pete since only normal hemoglobin was mentioned, implying no sickling or abnormal shape changes in his red blood cells. Therefore, Pete did not have the condition of sickle cell trait or disease."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Apology: BBC director-general George Entwistle expressed 'deep regret' over 'these awful allegations' as he announced his U-turn on Radio 4, having previously insisted that no BBC inquiry was necessary Investigations: Detectives are to probe whether Sir OPTIONS: - BBC ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - BBC Radio 4 ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - George Entwistle ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - Newsnight Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - Radio 4 ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - Sam Greenhill ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice - Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice","completion":"In this ending, investigators discover that Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women came forward naming a former corporation employee as being his accomplice. With this new information, the BBC is forced to confront the shocking reality of a dark and hidden past involving not only the late Sir Jimmy Savile but also other employees within the organization. As a result of this revelation, George Entwistle, the BBC director-general, is compelled to take swift action to address the abuse scandal. He launches a comprehensive internal investigation, hiring outside experts to examine the BBC's workplace culture, policies, and procedures to ensure that the organization is doing everything possible to prevent any further abuse from happening. The investigation ultimately uncovers a series of coverups that took place over several decades, allowing the abuse to continue. Several high-profile employees, including some on-air personalities, are implicated in these coverups, leading to numerous resignations and dismissals within the organization. Entwistle personally apologizes to the victims of the abuse and pledges to make significant changes within the BBC to ensure that such abuse never happens again. In response to the scandal, the British government establishes a new public inquiry, examining not only the actions of the BBC but also those of other major media institutions to ensure they are doing all they can to prevent abuse and protect vulnerable individuals. This inquiry, known as the Independent Public Commission, becomes a long-term watchdog committed to ensuring that the media industry maintains high standards for employee safety and well-being. The brutal revelations about Savile and the wider sex ring begin a cultural shift within the media industry and British society as a whole. As awareness of the abuse grows, more and more victims come forward, inspiring others to share their experiences and seek justice. Through the inquiry, the government and the media are forced to confront their complicity in silencing the voices of victims and allowing powerful abusers to act with impunity. In time, the BBC emerges as a more transparent and accountable organization, with stronger safeguards to protect its employees and the people who interact with them. Workplace cultures change for the better, and the Savile scandal becomes a pivotal moment in history, leading to significant progress in addressing and preventing abuse not only within the BBC but throughout the media industry and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Again, start with about 5 strips of each and then cut as many as needed to create a full-looking mum. Be sure to use a hot glue gun to fasten charms and other heavier objects to the ribbons. To make a military braid, begin by stapling the ends of two different colored ribbons together at a right angle. Next, fold a colored ribbon towards you, forming a loop as long as the ribbon is wide and staple the ribbons together where they intersect. Take a loop of your second ribbon and bring it through the original loop of the first ribbon. Continue to bring a loop of the first ribbon through the second ribbon and pull the second ribbon tight around the first ribbon. Remember to alternate ribbon colors as you continue to do this until you reach the end of the ribbons. You will use your middle backer with the streamers for this step. Cut several pieces of curling ribbon each 36 inches (91.4 cm) long and tie a small bell to the end of each piece. Attach to the middle backer using hot glue. Staple the loop to the top center of the third, unused backer. This will serve as the base for your safety pin.

Question: What is El Greco's largest adversary? Movie title: El Greco Movie plot: The film tells the story of Domenicos Theotokopoulos, better known as El Greco, a great Greek artist of the 16th century with an uncompromising character, who sets off from his homeland Crete and goes to Venice and finally Toledo, in search of freedom and love. There he is confronted by his greatest adversary, the Spanish Inquisition, but his creative consciousness and power make him stand out and overcome barbarity and ignorance. Being imprisoned and awaiting execution by the Spanish Inquisition, Domenicos (Nick Ashdon) writes out his story, thus parts of his life play out in extended flashbacks. Born on the island of Crete, which was at the time part of the Republic of Venice, he falls in love with Francesca (Dimitra Matsouka), daughter of the Venetian governor of Crete. But his father is preparing a political rebellion and as a result Domenicos leaves the island and moves to Venice, away from the young woman. There he meets the famous painter Titian (Sotiris Moustakas) and the Spanish priest Fernando NiÃ±o de Guevara (Juan Diego Botto).

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" and the situation: Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation. Answer the following question: Who is more likely to die after this event? A:","completion":"Michael is more likely to die after this event due to his exposure to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. This acute exposure to ionizing radiation can lead to Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), which is characterized by symptoms such as skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and even death depending on the severity of exposure. On the other hand, Robert was in the adjacent room and was exposed to a significantly lower dose of radiation. While any radiation exposure poses a risk, individuals exposed to low doses of radiation are at a comparatively lower probability of experiencing immediate health effects. The primary concern for Robert would be the potential long-term risk of developing cancer or experiencing genetic damage due to the radiation exposure. However, it is important to note that calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation remains a challenging and uncertain task. Current estimates are generally based on population data from historical events such as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as reactor accidents like Chernobyl. Nonetheless, given the known dangers associated with high doses of radiation exposure, it is clear that Michael's situation is more immediately life-threatening and, as a result, he is more likely to die following this event compared to Robert."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Meditation was an aspect of the practice of the yogis in the centuries preceding the Buddha. The Buddha built upon the yogis' concern with introspection and developed their meditative techniques, but rejected their theories of liberation. In Buddhism, mindfulness and clear awareness are to be developed at all times; in pre-Buddhist yogic practices there is no such injunction. A yogi in the Brahmanical tradition is not to practice while defecating, for example, while a Buddhist monastic should do so. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The most important development for Buddha was his enhancement of the yogis' meditative techniques and his introduction of the concept of mindfulness and clear awareness to be developed at all times. While he built upon the introspective aspect of yogic practices, he notably rejected their theories of liberation, marking a key distinction in Buddhist philosophy and practice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: Wal-Mart's Sharp Fall Drags Dow Jones Index Lower Introduction: Retail giant Wal-Mart's recent tumble in share prices is affecting the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than many investors initially anticipated. As a pervasive component of the index, Wal-Mart's decline has caused a ripple effect on a broader scale. This article will explore the potential reasons behind Wal-Mart's nosedive and its implications on the Dow Jones index. Reasons Behind Wal-Mart's Fall: Over the past few years, Wal-Mart has faced increasing competition from e-commerce behemoth Amazon. The emergence of Amazon's presence in the retail sector has impacted brick-and-mortar establishments, including Wal-Mart, as consumers have shifted their buying habits from in-store to online shopping. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of e-commerce, further accentuating the gap between online and physical retail. Wal-Mart's attempt to compete directly with Amazon through its subscription service, Walmart+, has had a tumultuous start. Despite offering perks such as free shipping and discounts on groceries and fuel, the service has not gained the traction that its Amazon counterpart, Amazon Prime, has enjoyed. Moreover, the retail giant has struggled to replicate its domestic success on a global scale. While it remains one of the largest retailers in terms of global presence, it has faced difficulties adapting to local market trends and consumer preferences. Recent divestitures in regions such as the United Kingdom and Japan signify challenges that Wal-Mart has encountered in global expansion. Impact on the Dow Jones Industrial Average: As an indicator of overall economic conditions, the Dow Jones index draws its value from the collective performance of its 30 component companies, including Wal-Mart. Given that the shares of these companies are weighted by price, fluctuations in any component can significantly affect the index. In this case, the decline in Wal-Mart's shares has impacted the Dow Jones index substantially. Investors are acutely aware that changes to Wal-Mart’s stock can have broader ramifications when it comes to the health of the Dow Jones. Wal-Mart's significant role in the U.S. economy as one of the largest private employers and retail organisations means that its financial performance has a direct impact on the nation's economic health. As a result, the slump in Wal-Mart shares may be viewed as a leading indicator of underlying economic vulnerabilities, particularly in the retail sector. The Future Outlook: Retail analysts have offered diverse opinions regarding the future prospects of Wal-Mart. Some argue that the company's vast resources and deeply entrenched supply chain give it a competitive edge that should not be underestimated. Others, however, have expressed concerns that the company is overly reliant on its domestic operations, leaving it vulnerable to competitive pressures from Amazon and other e-commerce competitors. In response to changing consumer trends, Wal-Mart has continually adapted its business model in a bid to weather the storm. This has included a focus on sustainability, an increased emphasis on e-commerce, and a commitment to elevate employee benefits. Despite setbacks and ongoing challenges, the company remains a force to be reckoned with in the retail landscape. Conclusion: Wal-Mart's sharp fall in shares has indeed dragged the Dow Jones index lower, reflecting the ongoing challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retail establishments. The implications of this serve as a reminder of the interconnected nature of our global economy and the importance of adaptability in an ever-evolving business landscape. The retail titan's efforts to streamline its operations and stay relevant in an increasingly digital world underscore the importance of innovation in response to shifting consumer demands. As the retail industry continues to evolve in the face of digital disruption, the fortunes of Wal-Mart and the Dow Jones index will likely remain closely connected."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cold can affect other parts of the body.The expression \\"get cold feet\\" has nothing to do with cold or your feet.The expression means being afraid to do something you have decided to do.For example, you agree to be president of an organization.But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned, and all the work of the organizations will be your responsibility.You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation. The expression \\"give someone the cold shoulder\\" probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face to face.You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you.Or, to someone who has lied about you to others. A cold fish is not a fish.It is a person.But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth.A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone.Someone who is a cold fish could be cold-hearted.Now a cold-hearted person is someone who has no sympathy.Several popular songs in recent years were about cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feelings, broke the hearts of their lovers. \\"Out in the cold\\" means not getting something that everybody else got.A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise----he was left out in the cold.And it is not a pleasant place to be.

Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

Here is a detailed and long answer providing information about the Treaty of Lisbon, Lithuania's involvement, and its relation to the ECHR: The Treaty of Lisbon, signed on December 13, 2007, was an international agreement that amended the two treaties establishing the constitutional basis for the European Union (EU). The main objective of the Treaty of Lisbon was to streamline the EU institutions and improve their functioning, ensuring a more stable and efficient way for the organization to operate. Lithuania was one of the 27 member states of the European Union that signed this treaty. As a member state, Lithuania agreed to the terms and changes proposed by the Treaty of Lisbon, which increased the power and influence of the European Parliament and introduced the European Council's permanent presidency. Additionally, the treaty created the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, while also removing the pillar structure of the EU. Furthermore, by signing the Treaty of Lisbon, Lithuania also became a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR is a regional human rights treaty, drafted in 1950 by the Council of Europe, to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms within its member states. The European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, France, plays a crucial role in enforcing the provisions of the ECHR.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. Question: \\"How much are lawyers paying for their registration fees now?\\" Response: \\"90\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Possible answers: a). no. b). yes.","completion":"a). no. The response \\"90\\" is incorrect because that fee only applies to lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive. According to the text, the base fee for active attorneys was raised to 180 from 140. So, the correct registration fee for active lawyers is 180, not 90."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . - Robert Bernard Altman (February 20, 1925 November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and film producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a \\"maverick\\" in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema. - Assassination is the murder of a prominent person, often a political leader or ruler, usually for political reasons or payment. - An underground film is a film that is out of the mainstream either in its style, genre, or financing. - John Joseph Travolta (born February 18, 1954) is an American actor, producer, dancer, and singer. Travolta first became known in the 1970s, after appearing on the television series \\"Welcome Back, Kotter\\" (19751979) and starring in the box office successes \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977) and \\"Grease\\" (1978). His acting career declined through the 1980s, but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s with his role in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (1994), and he has since starred in films such as \\"Face/Off\\" (1997), \\"Swordfish\\" (2001), \\"Wild Hogs\\", and \\"Hairspray\\" (both 2007). - A cult following is a group of fans who are highly dedicated to a work of culture. A film, book, musical artist, television series or video game, among other things, will be said to have a cult following when it has a small but very passionate fanbase. A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a community. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or subversive to be appreciated by the general public or to be a commercial success. Many cult fans express a certain irony about their devotion. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings. Fans may become involved in a subculture of fandom, either via conventions, online communities or through activities such as writing series-related fiction, costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters. - Alicia Christian \\"Jodie\\" Foster (born November 19, 1962) is an American actress and filmmaker who has worked in films and on television.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she worked in several primetime television series and starred in children's films. Foster's breakthrough came in Martin Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver\\" (1976), in which she played a teenage prostitute; the role garnered her a nomination for an Academy Award. Her other critically acclaimed roles as a teenager were in the musical \\"Bugsy Malone\\" (1976) and the thriller \\"The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane\\" (1976), and she became a popular teen idol by starring in Disney's \\"Freaky Friday\\" (1976), \\"Candleshoe\\" (1977) and \\"Foxes\\" (1980). - Blow Out is a 1981 American thriller film written and directed by Brian De Palma.

Nancy Allen stars as Sally Bedina, a young woman involved in the crime. The supporting cast includes John Lithgow and Dennis Franz. The film's tagline in advertisements was, \\"Murder has a sound all of its own\\". - Slasher films are a subgenre of horror films, typically involving a violent psychopath stalking and murdering several people, usually with bladed tools. Although the term \\"slasher\\" is sometimes used informally as a generic term for any horror movie involving murder, analysts of the genre cite an established set of characteristics which set these films apart from other horror subgenres, such as splatter films and psychological horror films. - Art historians and philosophers of art have long had classificatory disputes about art regarding whether a particular cultural form or piece of work should be classified as art. Disputes about what does and does not count as art continue to occur today. - A talent agent, or booking agent, is a person who finds jobs for actors, authors, film directors, musicians, models, professional athletes, writers, screenwriters, broadcast journalists, and other people in various entertainment or broadcast businesses. In addition, an agent defends, supports and promotes the interest of their clients. Talent agencies specialize, either by creating departments within the agency or developing entire agencies that primarily or wholly represent one specialty. For example, there are modeling agencies, commercial talent agencies, literary agencies, voice-over agencies, broadcast journalist agencies, sports agencies, music agencies and many more. - In the motion picture industry, a \\"box office bomb\\" or \\"box office flop\\" is a film that is viewed as highly unsuccessful or unprofitable during its theatrical run, sometimes preceding hype regarding its cost, production, or marketing efforts. Generally, any film for which the production and marketing costs exceed the combined revenue recovered after release is considered to have \\"bombed\\". - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - Brian Russell De Palma (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter. He is considered part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking. - Jonathan Kaplan (born November 25, 1947) is an American film producer and director. His film \\"The Accused\\" (1988) earned actress Jodie Foster her first Oscar for Best Actress and was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival. Kaplan received five Emmy nominations for his roles directing and producing \\"ER\\". - The Golden Bear is the highest prize awarded for the best film at the Berlin International Film Festival. The bear is the heraldic animal of Berlin, featured on both the coat of arms and flag of Berlin. - Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the \\"discovery stage\\", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material. Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter. - George Litto is an American film producer and talent agent . His production credits include Robert Altman 's Thieves Like Us ( 1974 ) , Jonathan Kaplan 's cult film Over the Edge ( 1979 ) , and three Brian De Palma thrillers , Obsession ( 1976 ) , Dressed to Kill ( 1980 ) and Blow Out ( 1981 ) . - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - John Arthur Lithgow (; born , 1945) is an American actor, musician, singer, and author. He has received two Tony Awards, five Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, an American Comedy Award, four Drama Desk Awards and has also been nominated for two Academy Awards and four Grammy Awards. Lithgow has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and has been inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. - A cult film, also commonly referred to as a cult classic, is a film that has acquired a cult following. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation. Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art. The term \\"cult film\\" itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though \\"cult\\" was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that. - The Academy Award for Best Director (officially known as the Academy Award for Best Directing) is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. - New Hollywood, sometimes referred to as the \\"American New Wave\\", refers to a period in American film history from the mid-to-late 1960s (\\"Bonnie and Clyde\\", \\"The Graduate\\") to the early 1980s (\\"Heaven's Gate\\", \\"One from the Heart\\") when a new generation of young filmmakers came to prominence in United States, influencing the types of films produced, their production and marketing, and the way major studios approached film-making. In New Hollywood films, the film director, rather than the studio, took on a key authorial role. \\"New Hollywood\\" usually refers to a period of film-making rather than a style of film-making, though it can be referred to as a movement. The films made in this era are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often strongly deviated from classical norms. - Dennis Franz Schlachta (born October 28, 1944), known professionally as Dennis Franz, is an American actor best known for his role as hard-boiled NYPD Detective Andy Sipowicz in the 19932005 ABC television series \\"NYPD Blue\\", and Lt.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of less food being put into the mouth and resulting in less food traveling to the small intestine would be considered as directly impacting a step of the process. This is because the alteration in the quantity of food consumed directly affects the subsequent steps in the process of digestion and nutrient absorption. When less food is ingested, the amount of food that is chewed, mixed with saliva, and swallowed is also reduced. Consequently, this directly impacts the amount of food that enters the stomach, the amount of acid produced for digestion, and eventually, the food that travels to the small intestine. The direct impact on the process can be observed in the following ways: 1. Chewing and saliva mixing: Since less food is put into the mouth, the amount of food that needs to be chewed and mixed with saliva is also reduced. This can lead to faster completion of this step, giving the person more time to savor each bite and also potentially enhancing the overall digestion process. 2. Swallowing and esophageal movement: With less food to swallow, the esophagus has to perform fewer contractions to push the food into the stomach. This might result in a quicker and potentially more comfortable swallowing experience. 3. Stomach digestion: As there is less food entering the stomach, the organ is not as full, which can lead to quicker breakdown and processing of the food by stomach acid. This can also have an impact on the possible sensation of fullness or discomfort that one might feel during digestion. 4. Nutrient absorption in the small intestine: With the reduced amount of food passing into the small intestine from the stomach, the absorption of nutrients will also decrease proportionately. This could potentially lead to faster passage of the food through the small intestine. 5. Waste elimination from the large intestine: Since the body processes and absorbs nutrients from less food, the amount of waste generated would also be less. This can affect the bowel movement frequency and might lead to quicker elimination of waste from the large intestine or changes in the overall bowel movement experience. In conclusion, the perturbation of consuming less food directly impacts the process of digestion and nutrient absorption. The ramifications of this change may bear influence on the experience of chewing, swallowing, digestion, and waste elimination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Photo: Larry Busacca/Getty Images Theranos Inc. withdrew its request for emergency clearance of a Zika-virus blood test after federal regulators found that the company didn’t include proper patient safeguards in a study of the new test, said people familiar with the matter. The move is another setback for the Palo Alto, Calif., company as it tries to recover from crippling regulatory sanctions that followed revelations by The Wall Street Journal of shortcomings in Theranos’s technology and operations. Theranos has said it is appealing. Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes announced Aug. 1 a new blood-testing device called miniLab that she said was designed for use outside a clinical laboratory and could run accurate tests from a few drops of blood. Ms. Holmes also said Theranos was seeking clearance for its Zika test, and a company news release said Theranos had collected finger-stick blood samples from patients, including in the Dominican Republic, and run the tests on the new miniLab device, which showed that the Zika test worked. But during an inspection by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this month, regulators concluded that Theranos had collected some data supporting the accuracy of the Zika test without implementing a patient-safety protocol approved by an institutional review board, according to the people familiar with the matter. Institutional review boards ensure that patients are treated safely and ethically during medical studies. “We hope that our decision to withdraw the Zika submission voluntarily is further evidence of our commitment to engage positively with the agency,” said Dave Wurtz, Theranos’s vice president of regulatory, quality and clinical affairs. An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the inspection, citing the agency’s policy on pending product applications. It isn’t clear if the problem affected any patients. Some data in the submission was collected under review-board-approved protocols, the people said. Theranos didn’t contest the agency’s findings and withdrew its submission for authorization of the new Zika test, according to people familiar with the matter. Theranos executives told employees about the setback during a staff meeting last week, one person familiar with the meeting said. In an email to Theranos investors Saturday, the company said it plans to collect additional data requested by the FDA under properly reviewed protocols and resubmit the Zika application. The letter said Theranos would handle a submission for an Ebola test “in the same manner.” The miniLab that Ms. Holmes, Theranos’s chief executive, unveiled to laboratory scientists in Philadelphia signaled a potential shift in the closely held company’s business model and a new source of revenue. FDA approval of the miniLab would allow Theranos to sell the device for outside use even if she is banned from owning or running a lab for at least two years. The federal agency that oversees labs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, imposed the ban and other penalties in July because of problems it found at a Theranos lab. The agency said the deficiencies affected test accuracy and put patients at risk. Theranos is appealing the lab’s closing, Ms. Holmes’s ban and other sanctions imposed by CMS and is continuing to negotiate a possible settlement. Theranos also has said it is doing no patient testing at the lab where the deficiencies were found. In its investor email Saturday, Theranos said its appeal will argue that CMS hasn’t “fully accounted for the progress we have made toward correcting” problems. A CMS spokesman said Tuesday the agency is “reviewing a copy of Theranos’s appeal.” He declined further comment. Theranos has pursued a manufacturing-focused business model before. An initial agreement with former retail partner Walgreens, now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., WBA 0.14 % called for Theranos to sell blood-testing devices directly to the drugstore giant and have Walgreens perform the tests, according to a 2010 contract between the two companies. The arrangement later shifted as Theranos sought tighter control over its proprietary technology and operations, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Michael Polzin, a Walgreens spokesman, declined to comment. The FDA’s inspection in August was triggered by Theranos’s request for “emergency-use authorization” to sell its new Zika test, a person familiar with the matter said. The FDA has cleared Zika tests from several other companies since invoking a rule allowing the agency to lower hurdles for new medical products during emergencies. An epidemic of the mosquito-borne Zika virus has swept through parts of South and Central America and reached into South Florida in recent months. The virus can cause serious birth defects in developing fetuses, including distinctively undersized heads and brain abnormalities. Theranos’s news release on Aug. 1 as Ms. Holmes spoke at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry’s annual meeting said the company believed no other test for Zika that uses tiny blood samples collected by finger sticks was available. “Theranos scientists conducted the tests reflected in the AACC presentation in 2016 under IRB-approved protocols,” the company added, referring to the review-board process. Theranos told investors that company officials “recognized” during the FDA’s inspection that some patient data was collected before the review-board protocols were in place. After an inspection in August 2015, the FDA declared Theranos’s finger-stick collection device, called the “nanotainer,” an uncleared medical device, and the company said it stopped using it on patients in the U.S. The agency earlier approved the use of nanotainers for a herpes test. Theranos said in its news release that it used the nanotainer as part of its blood-collection system for the Zika study, which included the Dominican patients. Separately, Theranos’s general counsel, Heather King, is leaving the company to return to law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, according to the email sent to investors. Theranos announced Ms. King’s hiring in May 2015, and she led the company’s legal response to accusations of technological snags. Boies Schiller Chairman David Boies is a Theranos director. “We appreciate Heather’s leadership and we wish her the very best,” Theranos said in its email to investors Saturday. In a sign that the blows to Theranos’s credibility during the past year continue to hang over the company, leaders of the University of Washington’s medical laboratory division balked when a Theranos manager approached the lab in late July about working with Theranos on research. “This is a disgraced company that has not responded to the sanctions in an honorable way,” the lab’s compliance officer wrote in an email to the University of Washington technician who fielded the inquiry from Theranos. “As such, do not set up a client account for this company,” according to the email, which was reviewed by the Journal. Write to John Carreyrou at john.carreyrou@wsj.com and Christopher Weaver at christopher.weaver@wsj.com ||||| The embattled blood testing firm's move comes after regulators found Theranos failed to implement proper patient safeguards in its study. (Reuters) It was supposed to be the beginning of a new era when Elizabeth Holmes, the chief executive of the beleaguered blood-testing company Theranos, took the stage at a major scientific conference earlier this month and presented a new technology and data on a Zika test. The company, Holmes told thousands of scientists, had already submitted the test to federal regulators for emergency-use authorization. But federal inspectors visited Theranos soon after and found that some of the Zika data collection had gone forward without an essential safeguard to prevent patient harm, according to a Wall Street Journal report published late Tuesday. The company confirmed that it has withdrawn its Zika test from consideration. The setback comes as a separate agency — the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — considers Theranos's appeal of harsh sanctions that included a two-year ban on Holmes owning or operating a laboratory after numerous deficiencies were found at its Newark, Calif. laboratory. \\"It's unfortunate for Theranos to be caught in another compliance issue so soon after the major issues were reported with their clinical testing laboratory,\\" Stephen Master, director of the central lab at Weill Cornell Medical College, wrote in an email. \\"Given the amount of scrutiny they're under, I would have expected them to be particularly careful about the regulatory issues surrounding research on human subjects.\\" [How Theranos’s reboot could backfire] Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported that inspectors found that some of Theranos's Zika data was collected without approval by an institutional review board, a committee that performs a critical stopgap function in medicine — overseeing and monitoring research, to make sure it doesn't pose a threat to patient safety. \\"The FDA cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any current/pending product applications,\\" agency spokeswoman Tara Goodin wrote in an email. According to the company's earlier news release about the Zika test, finger-stick blood samples were collected from patients in the Dominican Republic and shipped to Palo Alto, Calif., where the company is headquartered. That release also specified that the data that were presented in its scientific presentation in early August were conducted under protocols that had been approved by an institutional review board. The company plans to resubmit the test for approval. “In my mind, this was a positive interaction with the FDA, and I’m grateful for its collaborative approach,\\" Dave Wurtz, Theranos's vice president of regulatory, quality and clinical affairs said in a statement. \\"We hope that our decision to withdraw the Zika submission voluntarily is further evidence of our commitment to engage positively with the agency. We are confident in the Zika tests and will resubmit it.” Theranos also announced last week that it was appealing sanctions imposed by regulators. Since the announcement of the sanctions, \\"Theranos has made substantial progress toward correcting the deficiencies CMS identified, including appointing new laboratory leadership; enhancing Theranos’ clinical policies and procedures; and revamping training programs,\\" the company said in a statement. CMS spokesman Tony Salters said the appeal is under review and that as with any ongoing enforcement issue, the agency would not comment further. Here's what you need to know about Theranos, a biotech company founded in 2003 by Stanford dropout Elizabeth Holmes. (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) Read More: What happened when I tried the new blood test that was promised to change the world The sobering thing doctors do when they die Emails reveal that concerns about Theranos’s FDA compliance date back years ||||| That didn't take long. Theranos pulled the emergency request for its Zika-testing miniLab following an FDA inspection that revealed shortcomings with patient protocol, according to The Wall Street Journal . WSJ's sources say that while the blood-testing company had data showing that the testing methods worked, the evidence collected was done without \\"implementing a patient-safety protocol approved by an institutional review board.\\" Meaning, the experiments didn't have the type of oversight necessary to ensure that they were performed in stringent, controlled ways that would consistently provide accurate results and wouldn't harm the test subjects. The company says that it \\"recognized\\" that some of its data was gleaned before the needed protocols were in place. Theranos plans to appeal the Food and Drug Administration's ruling, of course, and collect the extra information requested by the FDA before trying the certification process again. Same goes for when the company attempts certification for its Ebola test as well. The miniLab itself was a way to sidestep founder Elizabeth Holmes' two-year ban from owning or running a lab or her own, precisely because the device was made for outside use. All of this raises the question of how long Jennifer Lawrence will have to wait for a final script for Theranos: The Movie. Seriously, this saga just keeps getting better. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Blood testing firm Theranos voluntarily withdrew its request for emergency clearance of a blood test for the Zika virus after federal regulators found that it failed to include proper patient safeguards in a study, representing another setback for the firm, which is trying to recover from crippling regulatory sanctions following revelations by The Wall Street Journal of shortcomings in its technology and operations.

A:","completion":"A full moon occurs when the Earth is positioned exactly or nearly directly between the sun and the moon. This means both celestial bodies lie opposite to each other in the Earth's sky, causing the moon's full face illuminated by the sun to become visible from the Earth's perspective. In more detailed terms, the moon orbits the Earth once every 27.3 days, an interval called the sidereal month, but due to the Earth's own movement around the sun, the so-called Synodic month, the time from one full moon to another, actually takes about 29.5 days. Throughout its orbit, the moon passes through different stages known as phases, and these phases correspond to the amount of sunlight reflecting from the moon to our eyes. A full moon is one of these phases and it occurs when the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun. Due to its position, the sun illuminates the side of the moon facing the Earth completely, giving it a circular appearance. From sunrise to sunset, the full moon sits low in the sky and begins to rise higher as the sun sets because they are on opposite sides of the earth. However, it's important to note that during most full moons, the alignment is not absolutely perfect. If it were, the Earth's shadow would darken the full moon, causing a lunar eclipse. Lunar eclipses only happen a few times a year because the moon's orbit is tilted about 5 degrees relative to Earth's orbit around the sun, preventing perfect alignment most of the time. During a full moon, the gravitational forces from the Earth and sun pull the moon from different directions, causing tides to be somewhat higher than at other times. This phenomenon is known as a spring tide, which has nothing to do with the season but refers to the action of jumping or springing up. Culturally, the full moon has been symbolically significant to humans from time immemorial. It appears in various forms in art, literature, mythology, and even influences agricultural schedules in many cultures. Each full moon has different names based on certain cultures too, like the Harvest Moon, the Hunter's Moon, or the Blue Moon, each with its unique folklore and symbolism."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Step 2: Isolate the term containing p 270 * p = -1350 Step 3: Divide both sides by 270 to solve for p p = -1350 / 270 Step 4: Simplify the fraction p = -5 So, the solution for the equation -22167*p + 22437*p + 1350 = 0 is p = -5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Bears, seeking to avoid going 0-3 at home for the first time in ten years, hosted the Miami Dolphins in week seven, trailing the all-time series 4-7, though the Bears won the most recent game in 2010, 16-0. The Bears had struggled at home during the season, scoring a total of 37 points and a -4 turnover differential; in contrast, the Bears had an average score of 26.5 and a +6 turnover difference on the road. In addition, Jay Cutler had nine passing touchdowns, two interceptions and a 104.6 passer rating in away games, while having four touchdowns, four interceptions (three of which occurred in the second half) and a rating of 84.7 at home, with a rating of 58.1 after halftime. Chicago had to protect Cutler from the defensive line duo of Cameron Wake and Olivier Vernon, both recording 1.5 sacks each in the previous week against the Packers. In addition, the Dolphins were ranked second in the league in sacks on third and fourth downs with 10. However, the Bears' receivers posed a size threat to the Miami secondary, though Miami was ranked third in yards per pass attempt allowed with 6.09, one of only eight teams allowing less than seven yards in 2014. The Dolphins also allowed only 3.8 yards per carry and yards allowed per play with 4.7 yards. On defense, the Bears would have to prepare for a Ryan Tannehill-led zone-read option offense, which has an average drive length of 3:08, third-fastest in the league. However, Tannehill could make mistakes, as he had thrown 35 interceptions in 37 career starts. The Dolphins also had the second-fewest completions of at least 20 yards with 11. The Bears would also have to watch the run game, which ranked third in the NFL with 4.97 yards per carry. Entering the game, the Bears' defense was tied for the fourth-most sacks (15), third-most interceptions (eight), and third in points recorded off turnovers (49). The Bears were the favorite by -3. Terrance Mitchell, Ahmad Dixon, Chris Conte, Lance Briggs, Jon Bostic, Charles Leno, Jr., and Trevor Scott were scratches for the game, while Jermon Bushrod, Brandon Marshall, Robbie Gould, Ryan Mundy and Jeremiah Ratliff were team captains. The Dolphins won the toss, and elected to receive. On the first play from scrimmage, Tannehill was sacked by Ratliff for a loss of five yards; Ratliff would finish the game with a career-high 3.5 sacks. After both teams punted on their first drives, the Dolphins scored first on Tannehill's 13-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay. On the Bears' next drive, Cutler fumbled on his own 38-yard line, but Ka'Deem Carey recovered the ball; the Bears would punt three plays later. Miami's eventual drive lasted into the second quarter, but ended with Caleb Sturgis missing a 50-yard field goal wide right. The Bears would reach the Dolphins' 37-yard line, but Cutler's pass for Martellus Bennett was intercepted by Reshad Jones, who returned the pick to the Bears' 29-yard line, and was stripped by Brandon Marshall, Koa Misi recovering at the 23-yard line. The fumble was subsequently challenged, but was upheld. Miami would drive to the Bears' eight-yard line, and two plays later, Tannehill threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace. Both teams would exchange punts at the end of the half, Miami leading 14-0. On their first drive of the second half, the Bears scored their first points of the game with Cutler's ten-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, though the Dolphins retaliated on their next possession with Lamar Miller's two-yard touchdown run. The Bears' drive lasted into the fourth quarter, but ended at their own 24-yard line when Wake strip-sacked Cutler, recovering it at Chicago's 16. The Dolphins would go three-and-out on the drive, resorting to Sturgis' 33-yard field goal. On the Bears' next drive, Cutler threw a pass to Dante Rosario, who fumbled after being stripped by Cortland Finnegan, Randy Starks recovering at the Bears' 35-yard line. However, the Dolphins failed to take advantage of the takeaway, Sturgis' 37-yard field goal being blocked by Lamarr Houston. Starting from their own 27, the Bears reached the Dolphins' 44, and a defensive pass interference penalty on Jason Taylor brought the Bears to the five-yard line. Three plays later, Forte scored on a one-yard run. The Dolphins would score on their next drive via Miller's four-yard run, but was nullified by holding penalty on Clay; Sturgis would kick a 19-yard field goal to make the score 27-14. Chicago's final drive reached Miami's 15-yard line, but the offense failed to gain ground, Cutler first throwing an incomplete pass, then fumbling but recovering, and finally throwing two more incomplete passes. Tannehill would kneel twice to end the game. The Bears fell to 0-4 in games where Cutler throws an interception. After the game, in the Bears' locker room, there were reports of shouting and players being pulled out of the room, with Marshall calling out Cutler, and Kyle Long criticizing the fans. Former Bears linebacker Blake Costanzo was also critical, stating Marc Trestman had \\"made the Bears soft\\". In an interview, Gould stated, \\"Everyone's trying to make this a story out of something that really wasn't that big of a deal. Obviously everyone's frustrated. Everyone wants to win.

Would Kenya have less or more organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania? In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Kenya would have less organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: One student started packing up at the beginning of a lab exercise. I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said. Next class he moved from the seat at the edge of my peripheral vision, to the middle, started working his ass off, and he passed.

Chrome includes no options to display a sidebar or status bar, or any other toolbar.\\" In this sentence, the author discusses different elements of a web browser's user interface. These elements are categorized into three primary sections: the address bar, the toolbar icons, and the tab bar. Let's explore each of these interface elements in detail. 1. Address Bar: The address bar is the text box at the top of a web browser window, typically used for entering website URLs or performing a search query. In many modern browsers like Google Chrome, the address bar also functions as a search bar, allowing users to type in keywords or phrases to quickly perform a search without having to navigate to a specific search engine website. 2. Toolbar Icons: These are the icons that typically appear on a browser's toolbar, which is the horizontal strip located either at the top or bottom of a browser window. Toolbar icons represent different functionalities and can be used to access features and settings within the browser. Some common toolbar icons include bookmarks, history, downloads, and settings. Users can also customize their toolbar by adding or removing icons that better suit their browsing needs. 3. Tab Bar: The tab bar is the horizontal strip near the top of a web browser window that displays a series of tabs, each representing a different open webpage. Tabs provide a means for users to easily switch between multiple web pages without having to open multiple browser windows. Some browsers, like Chrome, also allow users to group tabs together, making it easier to manage and navigate a large number of open tabs simultaneously. Interestingly, the author also points out that Google Chrome, a popular web browser, does not provide options to display other interface elements, such as a sidebar, a status bar, or any other additional toolbars. These features are present in some web browsers, and their functionalities are briefly described below. - Sidebar: A sidebar is a vertical panel that resides on one side of a browser window, usually the left side. It can be used to display various content, such as bookmarks, history, or other tools and features. Sidebars can be particularly useful for those who prefer an organized approach to browsing or utilizing browser features, as it provides quick access to commonly used tools. - Status Bar: A status bar is a horizontal strip, often located at the bottom of a browser window, that displays information about the webpage being viewed or the progress of a page loading. Some browsers also allow extensions or add-ons to display content in the status bar, offering users additional information or features. - Additional Toolbars: Some browsers offer the option to add custom toolbars to their interface. These can be created by the user or installed through extensions or add-ons. Custom toolbars can be used to provide quick access to specific functionalities or features that a user frequently uses, tailoring the browsing experience to individual needs and preferences. In conclusion, the interface elements discussed in the sentence include the address bar, toolbar icons, and the tab bar, which are essential components of a web browser's user interface. While Google Chrome does not offer options for sidebars or status bars, other browsers may provide these additional elements to enhance and personalize the browsing experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a text based on \\"new york set to allow people to change gender on birth certificate\\" Text:","completion":"Title: New York: Set to Empower Individuals with New Gender Change Policy on Birth Certificates Introduction: New York City is known for its progressiveness, open-mindedness, and being a frontrunner for change, constantly pushing the boundaries of conventional norms. The city that never sleeps has always been at the vanguard of social and political demonstrations, consistently voicing concerns for the rights and well-being of minorities. Keeping its tradition of being a leader in ensuring civil rights, New York is set to make another groundbreaking move, allowing people to change their gender on their birth certificates. The New Paradigm Shift: In an unprecedented decision aimed at supporting the transgender and non-binary community, New York City officials have proposed legislation that will make it permissible for individuals to change their gender on their birth certificate without necessarily undergoing gender reassignment surgery. This development marks a crucial milestone for the transgender community as it removes the barriers posed by conventional methods, allowing people to assume an identity that aligns with their true selves. The Road to Equality: The journey to achieving this milestone has been a long, arduous one. As with any civil rights movement, the battle for transgender rights and identity recognition has its roots in a series of protests, rallies, and well-organized movements led by activists and community members. This new legislation emphasizes the needs and rights of a community that has been largely marginalized, persecuted, and stigmatized. It is an opportunity to create new pathways that validate their existence and experiences. The Ripple Effect: This move holds the potential to create a ripple effect across the United States. Other states may follow suit and take similar legislative steps to support the transgender and non-binary community. Such a response is paramount in ensuring a future that values equal rights regardless of one's gender identity. This decision emphasizes the importance of self-identification, acknowledging that every individual has the right to assert and affirm their gender identity without restriction. Support and Resources: Enabling people to change their gender on their birth certificate requires support from various quarters. It is essential for healthcare providers, educators, and social service agencies to be knowledgeable about this new legislation and how it impacts transgender people who seek these services. Healthcare professionals need to ensure there is adequate psychological, medical, and emotional support for those exploring the possibility of gender change, ensuring that they receive accurate information and best practices. Educators play a crucial role in fostering a nurturing environment that empowers individuals while promoting understanding among their peers. Critics and Challenges: Despite this progressive move, there are those who argue against the idea of allowing people to change their gender on their birth certificates, citing moral, religious, and political concerns. However, such opposition predominately stems from ignorance and misunderstanding. It is essential for the transgender and non-binary community to engage in dialogue and debunk these misconceptions to create an environment of understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity. Conclusion: New York City's decision to allow individuals to change their gender on their birth certificates is a monumental step in advancing transgender rights. It recognizes the importance of self-identification, paves the way for greater gender equality, and, most importantly, offers opportunities for transgender individuals to lead their lives true to their identities. This legislation serves as a testament to New York City's commitment to ensuring equal rights for all, regardless of gender identity. And as the city takes these strides, it provides a shining example of empathy, understanding, and inclusion for the rest of the nation to follow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The New York Yankees are known for their distinctive uniform, which has a white jersey with dark, navy blue pinstripes, so this detail aligns with the information provided. However, let's analyze the first statement to see if we can conclude its accuracy with the given information: \\"A baseball player in a white uniform with dark stripes is partially on the ground, poised to catch a ball in his left hand as the ball quickly approaches.\\" 1. \\"A baseball player in a white uniform with dark stripes\\": As mentioned earlier, the Yankees' uniform colors match this description. However, there is no information provided about the specific player or game situation, so we cannot definitively conclude that the player in question is in this particular uniform at the time of the proposed scene. 2. \\"partially on the ground\\": Being \\"partially on the ground\\" could indicate that the player is diving, sliding, or has fallen while attempting to catch the ball. Although baseball players often find themselves in these positions, we cannot conclude that this player is partially on the ground based solely on the fact that he plays for the New York Yankees. 3. \\"poised to catch a ball in his left hand\\": Since the player is described as attempting to catch a ball, we know he is either an outfielder or an infielder. However, without further information, we cannot conclude that this player, specifically, would be in a position to catch the ball with his left hand. 4. \\"as the ball quickly approaches\\": This detail suggests that the ball is still in the air and has not yet been caught or landed near the player. Although the baseball player in question is a member of the New York Yankees, we do not have enough information to determine if he would find himself in this specific situation on the field. In summary, while the uniform description correlates with the information provided about the player's team affiliation, we cannot definitively conclude that a New York Yankees baseball player is \\"partially on the ground, poised to catch a ball in his left hand as the ball quickly approaches.\\" Additional information about the specific game situation, player position, and details surrounding the play would be necessary to support the conclusion of this statement confidently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: social, anti social, unfriendly A:","completion":"Kai can be described as a social person. The context illustrates that he enjoys spending time with his friends and actively seeks out their company. This suggests that he is outgoing, friendly, and comfortable in social situations. Showing an interest in others, engaging in conversations, and maintaining healthy friendships are all indicators of a social individual. Being described as social is often associated with positive traits such as being communicative, confident, and empathetic. It is clear that Kai values social interactions and establishing connections with people around him. This not only enriches his own life but also positively affects the lives of his friends by fostering a sense of belonging and camaraderie. On the contrary, an anti-social person might avoid social gatherings, have difficulty forming relationships, and feel uncomfortable in group settings. Such a person may prefer solitude and may not show an interest in connecting with others. Similarly, an unfriendly person would demonstrate a lack of warmth or friendliness and might be regarded as unapproachable or distant.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What are the places that people now go to exercise which was one of the places only Greeks were allowed in?\\" Context: \\"Throughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native \\"barbarians\\" and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid empire for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The places that people now go to exercise, which were once exclusive to Greeks in the Hellenistic world, are largely the remnants of ancient gymnasiums and other locations associated with physical fitness and Greek culture. Gymnasiums in the Hellenistic period were not just venues for physical exercise, but also served as centers for education, cultural gatherings, and social events for the Greek elite. They played a critical role in the preservation and dissemination of Greek culture, offering spaces for various athletic, philosophical, and artistic pursuits. These gymnasiums were exclusive to Greeks, as a way to maintain their cultural identity and uphold the social hierarchy imposed on the native populations. Today, the concept of a gymnasium has evolved significantly, and the modern-day gym has become a popular destination for people from various cultural backgrounds to engage in physical exercise. This shift towards inclusiveness can be attributed to significant changes in societal attitudes, breaking down the barriers that once prevented non-Greeks from participating in these spaces. However, there are still a few places where traces of the ancient Greek gymnasium influence can be found. Some sites of ancient gymnasiums have been repurposed over time as public parks, sports complexes, or recreational areas, promoting physical activity within the communities while preserving the historical legacy of the ancient Greeks. Examples of these sites include: 1. The Ancient Agora of Athens (Greece): This site contains the remains of an ancient gymnasium known as the Palaestra, which dates back to the 4th century BCE. As a space for wrestling and other combat sports, the Palaestra was an integral part of the Athenian gymnasium complex. 2. Olympia (Greece): This archaeological site, once the location of the ancient Olympic Games, features the ruins of a gymnasium and a palaestra. Visitors to Olympia can still witness the remnants of these historic athletic venues while learning about their cultural significance. 3. Priene (Turkey): The ancient city of Priene, located in modern-day Turkey, was once a center of Hellenistic culture. The ruins of its gymnasium can still be seen today, including a large courtyard and a complex of baths. 4. Ephesus (Turkey): This ancient Greek city also contains the remains of a gymnasium and a palaestra. Today, Ephesus serves as an open-air museum, showcasing various historical artifacts and structures, including the gymnasium site. In conclusion, while the concept of exclusive gymnasiums for Greeks has long been abandoned, the influence of these ancient spaces can still be found in the ruins of historic sites like those mentioned above. These locations remind us of the cultural legacy and uniqueness of the Hellenistic period and its impact on our modern understanding of physical fitness and well-being. However, it is important to recognize that today's gyms and fitness centers have evolved as inclusive spaces, open to people of all backgrounds, breaking down the barriers that once perpetuated inequality and cultural division in the ancient world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select from: I. plant is taller.. II. roof is taller.. Complete the following sentence. The plant is stopping the sun from reaching the top of the roof because the","completion":"The plant is stopping the sun from reaching the top of the roof because the plant is taller than the roof itself. This unusual situation occurs when the particular plant species or tree has an exceptionally rapid growth rate and has been allowed to grow unchecked for an extended period of time. The height of the plant creates an expansive canopy that effectively blocks the sunlight from reaching the roof's surface, leading to an overall reduction in the amount of sunlight the roof receives. Several factors may contribute to the plant exceeding the height of the roof. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Plant species: Certain plant species, such as bamboo or some species of eucalyptus, are known for their rapid growth and towering height. When left uncontrolled, these plants can quickly grow to overshadow nearby structures. 2. Soil quality: The richness of the soil can have a significant impact on a plant's growth rate. Nutrient-dense soil may encourage more rapid growth in certain species, leading to a taller and more robust plant. 3. Environmental conditions: The climate and weather conditions in the area may contribute to the plant's accelerated growth. Adequate rainfall, favorable temperatures, and extended sunlight hours can result in a more lush and taller plant. 4. Lack of maintenance: In some cases, property owners may be unaware of the plant's rapid growth or may not have the resources to maintain the plant's height. This absence of pruning and trimming allows the plant to continue growing unchecked, ultimately reaching heights that surpass the roof. The tall plant's ability to block sunlight from reaching the roof can have a range of consequences. For instance, the lack of sunlight can lead to a buildup of moss and algae on the roof, causing potential damage and shortening the roof's lifespan. Additionally, the shadow cast over the roof may create a cold and damp environment that affects the livability and energy efficiency of the building itself. In order to remedy this situation, it is recommended that property owners either prune or trim the plant to a safe height, where it no longer obstructs sunlight from reaching the roof. Alternatively, they may consider removing the plant altogether and replacing it with a species that has a more manageable growth pattern. By addressing the issue, they can help maintain the integrity of the roof, enhance energy efficiency, and improve the overall appearance of the property."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Blood Monkey Movie plot: Blood Monkey is a horror / jungle suspense thriller set in modern day Thailand. The film centers around anthropological professor Conrad Hamilton (F. Murray Abraham) attempting to study a new species of primate, possibly the missing link between humanity and the great ape, found in a hidden valley deep within the jungles of Thailand. The movie opens into action with Hamilton's initial research team trying to capture one of these new (and very large) primates, but fails and is apparently wiped out. Hamilton and his assistant Chenne (Prapimporn Karnchanda) survive and scour the camp site looking for clues and remains of their team. Meanwhile, another research team is inbound, this one a motley crew of incredibly naive college anthropology students with no idea of what they're in for. The students Seth, Amy, Greg, Sydney, Josh, and Dani are flown into a remote region of the Thai jungle, and picked up by a guide who drives them deeper into bush. He drops them off in a panic at the edge of trail/road, which leads further still into the foliage, claiming \\"bad things\\" are in there and won't go any further. He high-tails it back the way he came, leaving the students to march forth into the unknown. They walk until they reach the end of trail and set up camp. As evening sets in, noises from the jungle raise suspicion until a set of glowing green eyes can be seen close by, watching. Just before the unknown creature attacks, Chenne arrives with a flare that scares off the unseen menace. Chenne escorts the students to the relative safety of Professor Hamilton's camp, and the following day they meet the obsessed man and learn of his mission and their purpose...sort of. Hamilton professes of dream findings in a uncharted region of the jungle and their potential for career-launching documentation.

Do you know what a gang is? A gang is a group of people who come together and sometimes do bad things. There are a lot of gangs in New York City. In fact, people think there are more than 300 gangs! That's a lot, isn't it? Now, some of these gangs are very famous, like the Bloods and Crips. They have been around for a long time, but most gangs in New York City are small. These smaller gangs are like little teams, with only a few people in them. About 40% of the time when someone uses a gun in a bad way, it is done by these small gangs. One of these little teams is called the Very Crispy Gangsters. This gang has kids in it who are about the same age as your big brothers and sisters, from 12 to 20 years old. Now, sometimes people in gangs get mad at each other. This is called \\"disrespect.\\" It can happen when they see each other on the street or even online, where people talk and post pictures. This disrespect can lead to more bad things called violence. But did you know that New York City has had gangs for a very long time? Like even as far back as the 1800s! That's more than 100 years ago! Back then, there were gangsters too, and they were a lot different from the gangs we see today. A famous movie director named Martin Scorsese made a movie about these old-time gangsters called \\"Gangs of New York.\\" So now you know that there are many gangs in New York City, and they can sometimes do bad things.

The vote in the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, came the same day as the ECHR ruled against Russia's Federal Security Service over spying. The European court said Russia had violated privacy rights with a system to secretly intercept mobile phone communications. The Russian constitution takes precedence under the new Duma law. The measure was fast-tracked, giving the constitutional court the right to declare international court orders unenforceable in Russia if they contradict the constitution. It specifically aims to \\"protect the interests of Russia\\" in the face of decisions by international bodies responsible for ruling on human rights, according to Tass news agency. Also on Friday, the ECHR ordered Russia to pay Roman Zakharov, editor-in-chief of a publishing company, €40,000 (£29,000) in expenses in a case over state spying. It agreed with Mr Zakharov that Russia's FSB security service had violated his rights to privacy by installing secret surveillance systems, and denying him the ability to resist potential monitoring. Russia ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1998, and is one of 47 member states in the Council of Europe, which monitors compliance with the convention. This year Russia contributed nearly €33m to the CoE's €306m budget. But Russia has often taken issue with rulings against it, including one by the ECHR last year ordering Moscow to pay more than 2bn (£1.3bn; €1.8bn) in compensation to shareholders in the defunct Russian oil firm, Yukos. In a separate development on Friday, Hungarian prosecutors said they had questioned a Hungarian MEP suspected of spying on EU institutions for Russia. Chief Prosecutor Imre Keresztes said Bela Kovacs, a member of Hungary's far-right Jobbik party, denied the spying allegations and made a case for his defence. The European Parliament lifted Mr Kovacs' immunity in October, which Jobbik said would help clear the MEP's name. Investigators have until 20 December to bring charges, according to reports.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers? , can you please find it? Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers is William Bruce. He was a Scottish architect and an Episcopalian, who faced conflicts with his Protestant rulers during the reigns of James VII and William of Orange. He was imprisoned multiple times for refusing to appear before the Privy Council and for being considered a potential Jacobite threat.

Участник, который задал мне этот вопрос, был первопроходцем и самым активным сторонником идеи обсуждения этой темы. В его вопросе звучала некая озабоченность и любопытство относительно моего мнения об этом фундаментальном аспекте, который напрямую влияет на представление и развитие каждого народа и государства. Обсуждение национальной идеи открывает основные аспекты сущности и самобытности народа, его исторического опыта, преемственности традиций и ценностей. Важность этой идеи заключается в том, что она предлагает моменты сплочения и объединения нации вокруг общих идей, целей и представлений о будущем и настоящем. Более того, национальная идея имеет свои корни в глубоких культурных кодах и символах, а потому ее изучение и осмысление позволяет отслеживать насыщенный контекст и налаживать эффективный культурный диалог между разными поколениями.

Context: The Treaty of Sèvres was signed by the Ottoman Empire and was followed by the occupation of Artvin by Georgian forces on 25 July. The Treaty of Alexandropol was the first treaty signed by the Turkish revolutionaries. It nullified the Armenian activities on the eastern border, which was reflected in the Treaty of Sèvres as a succession of regions named Wilsonian Armenia. The 10th item in the Treaty of Alexandropol stated that Armenia renounced the Treaty of Sèvres, which stipulated Wilsonian Armenia. After the peace agreement with the Turkish nationalists, in late November, a Soviet-backed Communist uprising took place in Armenia. On 28 November 1920, the 11th Red Army under the command of Anatoliy Gekker crossed over into Armenia from Soviet Azerbaijan. The second Soviet-Armenian war lasted only a week. After their defeat by the Turkish revolutionaries the Armenians were no longer a threat to the Nationalist cause. It is also possible to claim that had the ADR been content with the boundaries as of 1919, it could have shown more resistance to the Bolshevik conquest, both internally and externally, but that was not how things happened. On 16 March 1921, the Bolsheviks and Turkey signed a more comprehensive agreement, the Treaty of Kars, which involved representatives of Soviet Armenia, Soviet Azerbaijan, and Soviet Georgia. The arms left by the defeated ADR forces were sent to the west for use against the Greeks. Question: Which treaty came first the Treaty of Sevres or the Treaty of Alexandropol? Answer:","completion":"The Treaty of Sèvres came first, signed on August 10, 1920, between the Ottoman Empire and the Allied Powers, including the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. It was aimed at the partition of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and addressed various territorial issues. However, the treaty was never ratified due to the rise of the Turkish War of Independence led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, which resulted in the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. The Treaty of Alexandropol was signed later on December 2-3, 1920, between the Turkish revolutionaries, represented by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, and the Democratic Republic of Armenia. This treaty nullified the provisions concerning Armenia in the Treaty of Sèvres and helped establish new borders between Armenia and Turkey. The Treaty of Alexandropol, however, was later superseded by the Treaty of Kars, signed on October 13, 1921, between Turkey and the Soviet Republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, which finalized the borders and political agreements in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, we have the equation: 0 = -79*a - 110*a + 636 + 1254 We have two \\"a\\" terms: -79a and -110a. We can add them together, just like you combine apples with apples. So, -79a - 110a becomes -189a. Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -189*a + 636 + 1254 Next, we add the numbers 636 and 1254 just like any other numbers. When we do that, we get 1890. Now, our equation looks like: 0 = -189*a + 1890 Now we simply have to find the value of \\"a\\" that makes the equation true. So, let's rearrange the equation to solve for \\"a\\": -189*a = -1890 Next, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -189 so that we are left with only \\"a\\" on the left side: a = -1890 / -189 Now, we just need to find the result of that division: a = 10 So, the value of \\"a\\" that makes the equation true is 10."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Children aged 5 to 12 are advised to sleep 10 to 11 hours every night, but most of them can't sleep that long. A study found that about 41 million American workers got less than six hours of sleep every night. Scientists worry that parents are passing their bad sleeping habits down to their children. In the study, Reut Gruber and some other scientists either added or reduced on hour of sleep for healthy children aged 7 to 11. They watched the children for five nights. They wanted to know if the amount of sleep can affect a child's behavior. Before the study began, students were asked to sleep the same amount of hours as usual. Their teachers were asked to record their behavior. After five nights of the records, scientists found that those who slept one hour less behaved worse than those who slept one hour more. Students with less sleep were more likely to feel sad and had more problems paying attention. The scientists chose to study children in their homes instead of in a laboratory, because they wanted to find out how everyday changes might affect children's behavior at school. \\"In the study, nobody became a talent, and nobody became crazy.

Plot title: Bashu, the Little Stranger Movie plot: The film opens in the midst of an Iraqi air raid in the state of Khuzestan in Southern Iran. Beizaei films Bashu (Adan Afravian) caught between bombs exploding, a scene of a Muslim woman (his Mother) burning, and a young girl (his sister) running lost in the smoke. He needs to escape and so he jumps into the back of a truck heading North out of the war. From this point on Bashu enters another reality in a remote farming village Gilan near the Russian border where the people are lighter skinned and speak a different language. There Bashu meets Naii (Susan Taslimi) and her children. By accepting him into her family as one of her own children, Naii poses the fundamental question we hear from the film - \\"Aren't we all children of Iran?\\" From out of war torn trauma, Bashu finds hope and trust with Naii's family.Parallels are drawn throughout the film between Bashu and Naii as culturally repressed figures in Iran. Bashu is a dark-skinned, Arab speaking boy, which at the time defied the Persian nationalism thought to unify the country. And, Naii being an uneducated woman who could not read or write would normally not be able to manage on the farm without her husband. Yet, these differences are what bring Bashu and Naii to depend on each other for support and their own sense of family and belonging. This bond is seal at the end of the film when the husband returns with a missing arm and therefore becomes grateful and accepting of Bashus role as his son on the farm.Although Naii and Bashu are culturally repressed characters due to their gender and race, Beizaei lifts them up as strong and successful characters able to survive on their own, care for each other, and thus defy the racial and sexist stereotypes against them.

The JNA formed a battlegroup to counterattack the next day. The JNA battlegroup, augmented by elements of the 9th Military Police Battalion, deployed at 5:50 a.m. and clashed with the HV force in Nos Kalik. However, the JNA counterattack failed. The HV captured 21 RSK troops in Nos Kalik, intent on exchanging the prisoners for Croats held under arrest in Knin. Following negotiations, the HV agreed to pull back on 11 April, but later declined to do so, claiming deteriorating security at the battlefield in general prevented the withdrawal. Several Serb-owned houses in Nos Kalik were torched after the HV captured the village. The HV clashed with units subordinated to the 180th Motorised Brigade of the JNA in a pink zone near Zadar on 17-22 May.

Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power.

This approach also does not efficiently open the box for full access to its contents. Option 2: Use a box cutter to cut the tape off the top of the box and pull open. This approach allows safe and full access to the contents inside the box. The risk of damaging the contents is minimal as long as the box cutter is used cautiously only to cut the tape. 2. **Selecting the best approach based on evaluation:** Considering the evaluation, the best approach to accomplish this goal is Option 2: Use a box cutter to cut the tape off the top of the box and pull open. This option minimizes potential damage to the contents and provides full access to the inside of the box. It is also a commonly adopted method to open boxes, so the user may already be familiar with this process. Moreover, it ensures safety as the person would be cutting away from themselves and not deep into the box."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Despite the user's satisfaction with the customer service at Handspring, they are appalled that they would have to pay 85 to fix the broken glass, which they believe to be a result of poor manufacturing or packaging. The reviewer is considering purchasing a different brand, such as Palm, as an alternative to paying the repair fee – this shows their lack of confidence in the product's longevity and resilience.

In Victorian London, an unseen criminal begins masterminding his \\"perfect plot on paper\\" which starts with a robbery taking place and three cats stealing a pink diamond. Three constables spot them and give chase, but the cats escape to the rooftops and glide off into the night, giving the stolen diamond to a mysterious horseman. The next day, Dr. Watson rushes to 221B in Baker Street and informs his colleague Sherlock Holmes of the robbery. Holmes then calls his pet mouse Jerry to bring him a copy of the Times. Jerry heads out to buy it while encountering Tom on the way, who also has something for Holmes. Jerry returns to Holmes' flat and hands him the paper or what was left of it after the chase. Reading a letter Tom had given to them for the night, Holmes and Watson decide to go to the Bruce Nigel Theatre where a performer named Red is seen. Holmes is told that she is being blackmailed and Holmes suggests who the perpetrator might be – Professor Moriarty. Holmes deduces that the Star of Punjab, a diamond that is light sensitive to the light of a solar eclipse which was to happen the following day, is to be stolen by the mastermind of the blackmail. At the Punjab Embassy, Spike and Tyke are assigned to guard the Star of Punjab. Spike begins to teach Tyke how to be a good dog guard, but the three cats from the previous night steal the diamond while an unfocused Spike is not looking. The three cats then leave a small button and retreat. They climb out through a hole in Red's home that leads to the tunnel and escape before Holmes, Tom and Jerry arrive. Upon arriving, Jerry tricks Tom into stepping into a broken board and the trio check the tunnel. Finding sawdust, they retreat after hearing Tyke sounding the alarm.

(CNN) -- As one of the most anticipated games of 2011, \\"Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds\\" (Capcom) doesn't disappoint with new characters, a story line with uber-villain Galactus and a new mode designed to make it easy to get involved in the action. After a 10-year hiatus, the popular fighting game brings the battle zones into the third dimension. While action remains in two dimensions, the characters are generated in 3-D and provide for a more robust visual image of the fighting. Each fight can be one-on-one or tag-team, with three characters on each side. One of the biggest question marks as the game's release neared was who would be in and who would be left off of the Marvel and Capcom casts. OPTIONS: - 3-D characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - CNN characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Capcom characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Galactus characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Marvel characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Marvel vs. Capcom characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Marvel vs. Capcom 3 characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers. - Two Worlds characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers.","completion":"Capcom characters are defined by their moves, he said, while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers.

Why other answers are wrong: 1. 3-D characters, Galactus characters, Marvel vs. Capcom characters, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 characters, and Two Worlds characters are not relevant descriptions and don't clearly differentiate between the characters from the two different franchises. 2. CNN characters are not relevant to the game and, as a news outlet, CNN doesn't have any characters to be included in the game. 3.

Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice.

Kick all mex out. To H. with any of them. - This sentence shows disrespect towards Mexicans, which is targeting a specific ethnicity. Therefore, this falls under the identity-attack category. 2. They argue, jail and execute the works. - This sentence is vague and not directed at a specific group or identity, so I would classify it as non-identity-attack. 3. It's time the White Male sticks up for himself, family and country. - This sentence mentions a specific race and gender (White Male), although it doesn't necessarily attack other identities, it suggests that white males should stand up against other groups. I would consider this as identity-attack. 4.

While it does not directly attack an identity, it supports such actions, so I would also classify it as identity-attack.

The BBQ chef tried to put the grill fork in the drawer but it wouldn't fit; the","completion":"drawer was too small and cluttered with other utensils, so he decided to find a more suitable place to store his grill fork. He began by carefully examining the kitchen, and realized that there were many potential storage solutions in the space. First, he considered hanging the grill fork on a wall-mounted utensil rack. This would provide easy access to the tool while also keeping it out of the way when not in use. However, the existing rack was already full of other essential cooking implements, leaving no available space for the long-tined fork. He knew he had to be more resourceful to find a solution for his storage problem. The chef then thought about utilizing the unused space above the cabinets in the kitchen. Although the area was a bit difficult to reach, it could accommodate larger tools such as the grill fork. Still, he hesitated to place it there, as the effort required to retrieve the fork each time he needed it might be inconvenient in the long run. Another idea that came to mind was repurposing a nearby empty vase as a storage container for his larger utensils. The vase was large enough to hold the grill fork and could also be used to store other bulky items like spatulas and tongs. This would not only solve his storage issue, but also give the vase a renewed purpose. However, the chef was still not fully satisfied with this solution, as he wanted the fork to be in a more practical and accessible spot. As he continued to contemplate on the matter, he realized that he had completely overlooked a magnetic strip on one of his cabinet doors, designed specifically for holding metal kitchen tools. He tested to see if the grill fork would be secure on the strip, and it held up effortlessly. Excited by this discovery, he rearranged some of the items on the magnetic strip to accommodate the grill fork. The chef finally felt contented with his found solution, as the grill fork was now easily accessible and stored safely away from potential hazards in the kitchen. He cleaned up the cluttered drawer that initially posed the problem, making a mental note to regularly organize his kitchen tools in the future. With the issue resolved, the BBQ chef could now focus on his culinary creations, knowing he had found an efficient and practical storage solution for his beloved grill fork."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who returned to Australia in 1917? , can you please find it? Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

Question: Given the following context: Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with services from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500 V DC overhead line. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.Altrincham Interchange is one of the Metrolink's termini. The interchange was refurbished (2015–16), and now includes a brand new footbridge, with 3 lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, a larger scale ticket office, and modern bus interchange. The new Interchange is a modern design building that looks fantastic and is helping to regenerate Altrincham city centre as the new building has helped to transform the surrounding area. The Interchange connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury. The service also includes Navigation Road station. Metrolink services leave around every six minutes, between 07:15 and 19:30 on weekdays, and less frequently at other times. National Rail services link the Altrincham and Navigation Road stations with Chester via Northwich, and with Manchester via Stockport. Altrincham Interchange, next to the railway station, is a hub for local bus routes. Manchester Airport, the largest in the UK outside London, is 5 miles (8 km) to the southeast of the town, and is connected via the Manchester Picadilly – Crewe line. There are plans in the future to create a new link between Manchester Airport and the Mid Cheshire Line, which Altrincham Interchange is a station on. Recently the Metrolink completed connections... answer the following question: What is the name of the new building that has helped to transform the surrounding area?

La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time. Two of the surviving members, including Jean L'Archeveque, joined the Caddo. The remaining six men, led by Henri Joutel, made their way to Illinois Country. During their journey through...

Which country experienced an increase in government revenue? The country of Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would mean more money for government spending. On the other hand, Silvania, a southern country increased taxation hoping they would increase collection amounts. The problem was that Silvanian people increased taxation above the critical rate. Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.","completion":"Hinland experienced an increase in government revenue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: where is the mole fraction of the i-th component in the total mixture of n components . Question: What were the problems with Dalton's original laws? The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the provided answer does not address the question about the problems with Dalton's original laws. To answer the question regarding the problems with Dalton's original laws, we need to understand the basics of Dalton's Atomic Theory and the issues that were later discovered. Dalton's Atomic Theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, had the following postulates: 1. Elements are made of extremely small particles called atoms. 2. Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and other properties; atoms of different elements differ in size, mass, and other properties. 3. Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed. 4. Atoms of different elements combine in simple whole-number ratios to form chemical compounds. 5. In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearranged. As scientific knowledge advanced, several problems with the original laws or postulates were discovered: 1. Atoms can be subdivided: Dalton proposed that atoms cannot be subdivided; however, later discoveries in the field of atomic particles showed that atoms consist of subatomic particles, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons. 2. Isotopes: According to Dalton, atoms of a given element had the same mass and properties, but researchers later found isotopes of elements that have the same chemical properties but different masses due to differing numbers of neutrons. 3. Incorrect representation of compounds: Although Dalton proposed that atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios, later discoveries revealed that compounds are formed with specific arrangements and structures, not just in simple ratios. 4. Incorrect mass ratios: Dalton believed that when elements combined, the mass ratios were as simple as possible, such as 1:1. However, researchers found that many compounds did not adhere to these guidelines, and the actual mass ratios were more complicated. In conclusion, although Dalton's Atomic Theory was groundbreaking for its time, subsequent scientific research has revealed several inaccuracies and problems with the original theory. However, it is important to acknowledge that Dalton's work laid the foundation for our modern understanding of atomic structures and chemical reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed.

Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time they had a similar problem. They often accept the opinions or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without thinking. They try to find a solution by trial and error. However, when all these methods fail, the person with a problem has to start analyzing. There are six stages in analyzing a problem. First the person must recognize that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot read it to class as he usually does. Sam must see that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the thinker must define the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must find out the reason why it does not work. For instance, he must determine if the problem is with the gears, the brakes, or the frame. He must make his problem more specific. Now the person must look for information that will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For instance, suppose Sam decided that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the gear wheels. At this time, he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about gears. He can talk to his friends at the bike shop. He can look at his gears carefully. After studying the problem, the person should have several suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an illustration. His suggestions might be: put oil on the gear wheels; buy new gear wheels and replace the old ones; tighten or loosen the gear wheels. Eventually one suggestion seems to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes very suddenly because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a new way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees that there is a piece of chewing gum between the gear wheels. He immediately realizes the solution to his problem: he must clean the gear wheels. Finally the solution is tested. Sam cleans the gear wheels and finds that afterwards his bicycle works perfectly. he has solved the problem.

Her music incorporates elements of pop, rock, country and blues. She has released ten studio albums, four compilations, a live album, and has contributed to a number of film soundtracks. Her songs include \\"All I Wanna Do\\" and \\"If It Makes You Happy.\\" In 2011, Crow separated from her label, A&M Records. The singer followed Nashville neighbor Brad Paisley's advice and, after being introduced to producer Justin Niebank and several Nashville-based songwriters such as Chris DuBois, Luke Laird and Chris Stapleton, started her first country music project. In 2013, Crow signed a recording contract with Warner Music Nashville and, a few months later, released \\"Easy,\\" the first single from the upcoming album, which became her first top twenty country radio hit and her highest charting lead single since 2005. Feels Like Home was released on September 10, 2013, and debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over 36,000 copies, becoming Crow's ninth top ten album. Crow was one of the opening acts for George Strait's 2014 leg of The Cowboy Rides Away Tour. Along with Stevie Nicks, Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris and Carrie Underwood, she made an appearance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, paying tribute to Linda Ronstadt, who was one of the inductees of 2014. Crow, along with country band Gloriana, joined Rascal Flatts on their Rewind Tour, which kicked off May 16, 2014. The 40th anniversary celebration benefit concert of the Austin City Limits Festival was held June 26, 2014. Crow hosted the event along with Jeff Bridges and performed with Kris Kristofferson, Gary Clark Jr, Alabama Shakes, as well her former guitarist Doyle Bramhall II.

The town's inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism, which is later codenamed Andromeda by the Army. A team is sent from the Army's bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. The video footage recorded by the retrieval team and their strange deaths capture the attention of General George Mancheck, the head of the bio-defense department, who activates \\"Wildfire,\\" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the United States. The team, headed by its creator, Dr. Jeremy Stone, investigates Piedmont. They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year-old man and a colicky baby who have survived the Andromeda outbreak. In an isolated underground laboratory, the Wildfire team begins their examination of the downed satellite and the two survivors. The laboratory is powered by a small water-cooled nuclear reactor.

Given the question: - A group of people work to design a satellite capable of accomplishing the need - A team designs the physical structure of the satellite - A crew builds the physical satellite - The satellite is packed into a capsule - The satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket - The rocket is launched into space. What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The first step of the process is to identify the specific needs and objectives that the satellite is meant to accomplish. This involves a comprehensive evaluation of the purpose, requirements, and desired outcomes associated with the satellite mission. To begin with, a group of experts – typically composed of scientists, engineers, and project managers – will gather to discuss and outline the goals of the satellite. These objectives could range from earth observation, weather monitoring, communication, navigation, scientific research, or military purposes. Once the mission has been defined, the team will then proceed to conduct a thorough analysis of the various constraints and challenges that could arise during the satellite development. This may include budgetary constraints, technological limitations, or regulatory and legal requirements. A thorough assessment of the potential risks and hazards that may be encountered during the satellite's life cycle, including launch, orbit, and operational stages, is also essential. After these preliminary discussions and analyses have been conducted, the project team will move on to establish the satellite's functional, performance, and environmental criteria. These include orbital parameters, payload capacities, transmission capabilities, power requirements, thermal control, and other mission-specific criteria that will guide the design process. With this foundation in place, the team can now proceed to the next step, which is to design the physical structure of the satellite. This phase will involve selecting appropriate materials, determining the structural layout, and incorporating essential subsystems such as power, propulsion, communication, and guidance systems. Once the physical structure of the satellite has been designed, the project will move on to the next stages, which include building, testing, packing into a capsule, and eventually launching the satellite into space. In summary, the first step in the process of designing, building, and launching a satellite is to identify the satellite's purpose, establish the objectives and requirements associated with the mission, and conduct a thorough analysis of the various constraints, challenges, and risks that may arise during the development process. This crucial groundwork sets the stage for all subsequent phases of the project, ensuring that the satellite will ultimately be capable of accomplishing its intended goals and objectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the background: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. and the situation: Terry and Jake are currently at a dinner party of a mutual friend. They are having a conversation while enjoying a glass of wine when suddenly on the TV there is a commercial about a new disease. This prompts Terry to mention that he actually has sickle cell anemia.

You argue that the court would be wielding ''legislative power'' in restructuring Bell and letting ''the antitrust tail wag the telecommunications dog.'' Congress used its legislative authority in outlawing the deliberate abuse of monopoly power and in providing the courts the remedies, including restructuring. The issue in U.S. v. A.T.& T. is the application of the law, not the attitude of Congress toward technology. We should no more have Congress take over this case, and turn it into a ''telecommunications policy'' debate, than we should drop murder cases in favor of a gun-control bill. You point to the expertise required of the court to restructure A.T.& T. Think of the expertise that can be developed by a judge attending to the evidence, as contrasted with that available to legislators with a thousand other fish to fry.

Use evidence from the fact that an ecosystem contains nonliving things to answer this question: \\"What is part of an ecological system?\\"","completion":"In order to utilize evidence from the fact that an ecosystem contains nonliving things to answer the question \\"What is part of an ecological system?\\", let's consider the various components that make up an ecosystem, specifically focusing on nonliving elements. Step 1: Define an ecosystem An ecosystem is a community of living organisms (plants, animals, and microorganisms) interacting with each other and their environment (nonliving factors), which work together to create a stable system. Step 2: Identify nonliving components of an ecosystem Nonliving components, also called abiotic factors, include aspects like the climate, sunlight, water, air, soil, and nutrients. These factors influence how the living organisms in the ecosystem function, grow, and interact. Step 3: Provide examples and evidence of nonliving components in an ecosystem - Climate: The temperature, precipitation, and humidity in an area influence which types of plants and animals can survive in that environment. For example, a desert ecosystem has a hot and dry climate, which determines the types of plants (like cacti) and animals (such as snakes) that can live there. - Sunlight: Sunlight provides energy for photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants produce their food. This energy then flows through the ecosystem as different organisms consume the plants and are, in turn, consumed by other organisms. - Water: All living organisms need water to survive. The availability of water in an ecosystem affects the types of organisms that can live there and the ways in which they interact. - Soil: Soil composition, fertility, and pH affect the types of plants that can grow in an ecosystem. Soil also contains nutrients that are essential for plant growth and support populations of microorganisms that help break down organic materials, recycling nutrients into the ecosystem. - Nutrients: Elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium cycle through ecosystems and are critical for plant growth. These nutrients are taken up from the soil by plants and pass through the food chain as animals consume the plants and each other. Step 4: Wrap up the answer In conclusion, an ecological system comprises various living and nonliving components that interact with each other to support life. The nonliving components, or abiotic factors, include elements like climate, sunlight, water, air, soil, and nutrients. These factors play an essential role in determining the types of organisms that can inhabit an ecosystem, as well as their growth, functioning, and interactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Separated from the Iberian peninsula by the Strait of Gibraltar, Ceuta lies along the boundary between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Ceuta, along with the Spanish exclave Melilla, is one of nine populated Spanish territories in Africa and one of two populated territories on mainland Africa. It was part of Cádiz province until 14 March 1995 when the city's Statute of Autonomy was passed. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - Celestial mechanics is the branch of astronomy that deals with the motions of celestial objects. Historically, celestial mechanics applies principles of physics (classical mechanics) to astronomical objects, such as stars and planets, to produce ephemeris data. As an astronomical field of study, celestial mechanics includes the sub-fields of Orbital mechanics (astrodynamics), which deals with the orbit of an artificial satellite, and Lunar theory, which deals with the orbit of the Moon. - Jurisprudence is the science, study, and theory of law. It includes principles behind law that make the law. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as jurists or legal theorists (including legal philosophers and social theorists of law), hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems, and of legal institutions. Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems in two rough groups: - Melilla ( \\"Maliliyyah\\") is a Spanish autonomous city located on the north coast of Africa, sharing a border with Morocco with an area of . Melilla, along with Ceuta, is one of two permanently inhabited Spanish cities in mainland Africa.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - A (', , \\"doctrine\\"; pl. ') is a school of thought within \\"fiqh\\" (Islamic jurisprudence). In the first 150 years of Islam, there were numerous \\"madhahib\\", most of which have become extinct or merged with other schools.

It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris. It is difficult to define the date at which they became true universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe are a useful guide, held by the Catholic Church and its various religious orders. - Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula.

Earth and the Moon orbit about their barycentre (common center of mass), which lies about from Earth's center (about of the radius of Earth). On average, the Moon is at a distance of about from Earth's centre, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii. With a mean orbital velocity of , the Moon appears to move relative to the stars each hour by an amount roughly equal to its angular diameter, or by about half a degree. The Moon differs from most satellites of other planets in that its orbit is close to the plane of the ecliptic, and not to Earth's equatorial plane. The plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by about 5°, whereas the Moon's equatorial plane is inclined by only 1.5° to the ecliptic. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - JURIST is an online legal news service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, powered by a staff of more than 60 law students working in Pittsburgh and other US locations under the direction of founding Publisher & Editor-in-Chief Professor Bernard Hibbitts, Acting Executive Director Andrew Morgan, Research Director Jaclyn Belczyk, Technical Director Jeremiah Lee, Managing Editor Joseph Macklin and Chief of Staff Steven Wildberger.

Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been President since 1999. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation.

Select the topic that this about: AP - The Cleveland Indians called up right-hander Kyle Denney to start Tuesday night against Detroit.","completion":"The topic of this discussion is the Cleveland Indians' decision to call up right-handed pitcher Kyle Denney to start on Tuesday night against the Detroit Tigers in an American League (AL) game. This move signifies an important milestone for the prospect Denney, as well as a strategic decision for the organization. Here, we will provide a detailed explanation of the factors behind this move, an overview of Kyle Denney's background and abilities, and what this means for both the Cleveland Indians and the Detroit Tigers. First, let us provide some background on Kyle Denney. A right-hander from Paragould, Arkansas, Denney was drafted in the 26th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft by the Cleveland Indians. Prior to his MLB career, Denney played college baseball at the University of Oklahoma, where he showed great potential as a starting pitcher. Known for his solid fastball, which can reach velocities up to 95 mph, Denney also possesses a good changeup and a decent curveball in his pitching arsenal. With his skillset and strong work ethic, he has steadily worked his way through the Indians' minor league system, earning a reputation as a promising prospect. The decision to call up Denney to make his MLB debut against the Detroit Tigers can be attributed to several factors. First and foremost, it provides the opportunity for the Cleveland Indians to evaluate Denney's performance at the highest level of competition. By gauging how well he can perform against a major league lineup, the Indians can better understand his true potential and make informed decisions about his role in the organization moving forward. Furthermore, considering that the Indians have contended for playoff positions in the AL, it is critical to explore all available pitching options to bolster their rotation and improve the team's odds of success. Another factor behind this move is the need to rest established pitchers on the roster. Over the course of a long 162-game season, starting pitchers are susceptible to fatigue and potential injuries. By promoting Denney, the Indians can provide some respite to their regular starters, ensuring that they remain fresh and effective for the rest of the season and any potential postseason play. This strategic decision could lead to better overall team performance, thereby increasing the likelihood of a deep playoff run. For the Detroit Tigers, facing a relatively unknown quantity such as Denney presents challenges in terms of preparation and game strategy. Without an established scouting report on the right-hander, the Tigers' hitters may have difficulties adjusting to his pitching repertoire and tendencies. Consequently, it can be said that the element of surprise may work to both Denney's and the Indians' advantage in this matchup, forcing the Tigers' lineup to adapt on the fly. In conclusion, the Cleveland Indians' decision to call up right-handed pitcher Kyle Denney to make his MLB debut against the Detroit Tigers is a multifaceted move influenced by multiple factors. These factors include evaluating Denney's potential, providing rest to established starters, and exploiting the element of surprise against the opposing lineup. Ultimately, this strategic move could play a key role in shaping the remainder of the Indians' season and determining their playoff fate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the Levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was to him as one of his sons Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"The passage you have provided reads, \\"And the Levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was to him as one of his sons\\". It is a little hard to understand due to the lack of commas and proper punctuation. A clearer version might be: \\"And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man was to him as one of his sons.\\" In the revised sentence, the comma after \\"man\\" serves to separate the two independent clauses: \\"the Levite was content to dwell with the man\\" and \\"the young man was to him as one of his sons\\". However, we can still add a semicolon to provide a more sensible division between the two ideas. Here's how it would look: \\"And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; the young man was to him as one of his sons.\\" The semicolon here indicates a closer relationship between the two independent clauses than a period would. The ideas in the two clauses are clearly connected—the first part speaks about the Levite living with a man, and the second further elaborates on the relationship the Levite had with a particular young man, presumably living in the same dwelling. This version both reads better and gives more insight into the depth of the relationship between the Levite, the man, and the young man. Of course, the interpretation and punctuation can vary based on more context from the source text. It is quite possible if it's from a religious or historical document – the sentence structure and punctuation rules can be different from modern English as we know it. Nonetheless, according to the modern English grammatical standards, my proposed versions with the comma or semicolon would enhance the readability and understanding of the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Could we survive if we jumped inside a free-falling lift just before hitting the ground? What happens to us if we are inside a free falling lift and jump just before it hits the ground? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"1. Could we survive if we jumped inside a free-falling lift just before hitting the ground? To answer this question accurately, we need to understand physics, particularly the principles of momentum and kinetic energy. To put it simply, in a free-falling lift (or elevator), you along with the lift are falling under the force of gravity. This means both you and the lift are accelerating downwards at the same rate, which is roughly 9.8m/s². Now, the conjecture is that if you jump just before the lift hits the ground, you would be able to cancel out the downward velocity and, therefore, survive the impact. But practically, that's not possible for a human. The speed at which you would need to jump upwards to cancel out the downward velocity is unrealistic for a human to achieve, particularly given that the lift could be falling at tens or even hundreds of mph depending on the height of the fall. Consider this: a high-speed runner clocks in at roughly 20-30 mph and that's in forward momentum, not against gravity. The faster the elevator falls, the faster you would need to jump, and at some point, it becomes an impossible feat. Moreover, even if you somehow managed to jump up at the exact right moment and at the exact velocity, you're still in a confined space which would be disastrously crumpling around you due to the impact. Thus, if the fall is from a significant height, the chances of survival by jumping right before the impact are extremely slim to none. 2. What happens to us if we are inside a free-falling lift and jump just before it hits the ground? Similar to the question above, when you're in a free-falling lift that is falling under the force of gravity, you're also falling at the same rate. Thus, when the lift hits the ground, the sudden deceleration would result in you experiencing a force equivalent to a high-speed car crash, making survival very unlikely. Despite the popular idea that jumping might help, it wouldn't significantly change the outcome for the reasons explained in the previous question: it's impossible for a human to jump with sufficient speed to cancel out the downward velocity in a free-falling lift. Furthermore, even if you could and did jump, the lift would still crash around you, most likely causing fatal injuries. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Though these two questions are asking about related situations, their core focus differs slightly. The first question, \\"Could we survive if we jumped inside a free-falling lift just before hitting the ground?\\" is asking about the possibility of survival in such a situation, focusing on the hypothetical actions a person might take to affect the outcome. The second question, \\"What happens to us if we are inside a free-falling lift and jump just before it hits the ground?\\" is asking for a description or explanation of the physical events that would occur in such a scenario, not necessarily focusing only on the survival aspect but on the overall situation. So while both are dealing with the same circumstance, the intent and focus of each question is slightly different."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The mortality can be divided into two types: Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Lettuce has been eaten for over 4,500 years, and was known to the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Now, people in some countries start the meal with lettuce as part of a salad. There are hundreds of kinds of lettuce. The main ones include head lettuce, such as iceberg, leaf lettuce,Boston, bibb and romaine. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. The best time to plant the seeds is during cool weather. The University of Illinois Extension advises that the best planting temperature is 150C. Lettuce seeds are small, so do not place them too deep in the ground. If you plant some seeds every week or two, you will have crops ready to eat one after another. To start the seeds inside, you can use a seed tray in your home or other shelter. This container should be deep enough to hold at least three centimeters of soil or more. There should be about one centimeter of space between the soil and the top of the container. The container should have holes in the bottom so the extra water can flow out. Drop the seeds over the surface and cover them lightly with soil. If the soil is not already a little wet, give it some water. But do not drown the seeds. Next, cover the seed tray with paper. When the seedlings have come up far enough to touch the paper, take it off. You can transplant the seedlings into the garden when they are about two to three centimeters tall. Do this when the weather is not too hot and not too cold. Take out as much soil as you can with the seedlings, Then dig a hole in the ground bigger thanthe lettuce roots. Water the plants but not too heavily. Harvest leaf lettuces when the leaves are big enough to eat. Pull the leaves from the outside of the planting so the inside leaves will keep growing. Or, you can cut off the whole plant. Leave about two or three centimeters above the ground so the plant will re-grow. Cut off head lettuces at ground level.

Please briefly summarize this news article: MH17 plane crash site: sunhats, sweets … and stakes marking body parts Passengers' belongings at the site of the Malaysia Airlines plane crash in east Ukraine. Photograph: Dominique Faget/AFP For miles around, you can see them, strips of white cotton attached to wooden stakes in the fields of eastern Ukraine. Each stake marks a victim from flight MH17, or at least a body part. There are a lot of stakes. But then there is a lot of debris, a vast wash of metal, charred remnants, and the surreal paraphernalia of international long-haul travel, smeared over a ruined 15-square mile area. Handbags. Footwear. Passports amid the sunflowers. You can tell some of the passengers had been on holiday. Scattered across the crash site was the unmistakable jetsam of vacation: sunhats and suntan lotion, summer clothing, duty free shopping, the occasional poolside novel. You could also tell that children were here from the unopened packets of Haribo sweets, the fistful of playing cards, a first-year drawing scrawled in a notebook, a small black-and-white stuffed monkey abandoned in the grass. Some of the bodies are perfectly intact, some ruined beyond recognition, some partly disrobed by the G-force of falling to earth. One woman lies partly burned, a hand raised above her head, stripped of all but her undergarments. It was not just the human passengers that died. An unlikely menagerie of dead pets lay strewn across the scene in the grass, bright blue and yellow macaws, a cockatoo, a random giant St Bernard dog curled peacefully where he fell. The sticky Ukrainian summer will not be kind to the bodies. Warm sunshine gave way to rain and humidity on Friday. By late afternoon, the sharp tang of kerosene had been overpowered by something altogether more macabre: the cloying smell of death. They're getting used to death here. This is a de facto war zone. Explosions rang out every few minutes as a reminder. And when the separatist rebels first saw the debris falling on Thursday afternoon, their initial thought was that they might be under attack from paratroopers. \\"Initially I thought it was a paratrooper descending from the plane but then realized that there were people falling from the sky in the passenger seats,\\" said one of the rebels Vladimir, 45, holding a Kalashnikov in his hands. Rescue workers were overwhelmed by the scene. Volunteer miners combed the long grass for bodies; some of the first emergency workers on the scene bizarrely happened to be a unit trained in scuba diving search and rescue. \\"This isn't our area of expertise,\\" said Boris, 41, an experienced diver who drove his unit to the scene in a Soviet-era Gaz military vehicle. \\"We have no idea where anything is, we have a huge task ahead of us. We've not experienced anything like this, nothing on this scale.\\" Additional reporting by Oksana Grytsenko","completion":"There was a really sad thing that happened when a big airplane called MH17 crashed in a place called eastern Ukraine.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Jack William Nicklaus (born January 21, 1940), nicknamed The Golden Bear, is an American retired professional golfer. He is widely regarded as the greatest golfer of all time, winning a record 18 career major championships, while producing 19 second-place and 9 third-place finishes, over a span of 25 years. Nicklaus focused on the major championships--Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship--and played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (79). In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff. These victories and placements more than justified the work Nicklaus put in toward his game during the off-season. Nicklaus set a new scoring record for the 1980 U.S. Open with an aggregate of 272, eclipsing his earlier record of 275 from 1967 over the same golf course. That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open. This was Nicklaus's second major win at Baltusrol Golf Club. Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki. Entering the final round, Aoki had caught Nicklaus after three consecutive rounds of 68, but over the course of the last day, Nicklaus pulled away by two shots. Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish. Aoki's aggregate of 274 was the lowest score for a U.S. Open runner-up. Nicklaus' win was his fourth and final victory in the championship, tying him with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan. Nicklaus referred to this win as \\"by far the most emotional and warmest reaction to any of my wins in my own country\\". In the 1980 PGA Championship, Nicklaus set another record in winning the championship by seven shots over Andy Bean at the Oak Hill Country Club, largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 in the first round followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and was the only player to break par for the 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus' fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with Walter Hagen for the most wins overall, since Hagen's victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus' seven-shot winning margin remained the largest for the stroke-play version of the championship until Rory's McIroy's 2012 victory.

Earth Day is April 22.But on all other days,we must also remember it.The water we use is the most important natural resource on the earth. Water covers 70% of the earth's surface .But most of that is sea water.We can't use it for many things.Fresh water covers only 1% of the earth's surface. You probably feel lucky that your life isn't as hard as Napoga's.But that doesn't mean you don't have to worry about water.We all face serious water problems.One of them is water pollution.All kinds of things from cars,factories,farms and homes make our rivers,lakes,and oceans dirty.Polluted water is very bad for people to drink.And dirty water is bad for fish,too.Now,34% of all kinds of fish are dying out. How do cars and factories make our water dirty?First,they pollute the air.Then,when it rains,the rain water comes down and makes our drinking water dirty.Dirty rain,called acid rain ,is also bad for plants,animals and buildings. Scientists say that in 30 years,more than half of the people in the world won't have enough clean water.We have to learn how to save more water for ourselves and our children.Here is some advice for saving water: * Turn off the water while you brush your teeth.You can save as much as 450 liters each month. * Leaky taps waste a lot of water.Fix them right away! * You can easily cut your 10-minute showers in half--and you'll be just as clean. * When you wash dishes,don't let the water run. * Only wash clothes when you have a lot to wash.If your washing machine isn't full,you're wasting water!

Question: Faith in a high power is said to provide solace in times of what? Options: A. move mountains B. despair C. uneducated D. disbelief E. knowledge Answer:","completion":"Option B. despair Faith in a higher power is typically referred to as a source of comfort and solace during times of hardship, pain, and distress, when people feel their weakest or most vulnerable, thus the correct option in line with common sense is \\"despair\\". Despair often signifies a state of hopelessness or loss, and during such times, faith can be a vital coping mechanism. Belief in an omnipotent entity provides a sense of assurance that there is a divine plan or a bigger picture that we might not understand during times of despair. It offers hope, where perhaps there seems to be none, and gives people the strength to face challenges head-on, trusting that they are not alone in their struggle. This faith often provides a framework for understanding and processing the experience of suffering, changing the perspective on the situation and making it more bearable. This is why, during times of crisis or despair, many people seek refuge in their faith. In contrast, the other options do not align with the context. Option A, \\"move mountains\\", is metaphorical, it signifies achieving difficult or seemingly impossible tasks, not conditions under which people might seek solace. Options C, \\"uneducated\\", and E, \\"knowledge\\", do not connect to the notion of seeking comfort or solace during hard times. Option D, \\"disbelief\\", pertains more directly to a crisis of faith, or doubting the existence of a higher power, which is the exact opposite of drawing comfort from belief in it.

Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes, while working to save civilisations and help people in need. The show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite. The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot, in the form of a television film. The programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T Davies, who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. The first series of the 21st century featured Christopher Eccleston in the title role and was produced by the BBC. Doctor Who also spawned spin-offs in multiple media, including Torchwood (2006–2011) and The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007–2011), both created by Russell T Davies; K-9 (2009–2010); and a single pilot episode of K-9 and Company (1981).

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: His eyes were open and his head bobbed around at an impossible angle. He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?' Winslow shook his head. He'd gained weight in his face recently and his jowls vibrated with the gesture. According to the above context, answer the following question.

We can combine them by adding the coefficients together: -20*m + (-52*m) = -72*m So the equation now becomes: -72*m = 792 Step 2: Isolate the variable m To isolate m, we need to cancel out the coefficient -72, which is currently being multiplied by m.

Vivien Leigh (born Vivian Mary Hartley, and also known as Lady Olivier after 1947; 5 November 1913 - 8 July 1967) was an English stage and film actress. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress, for her iconic performances as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949. She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of Tovarich (1963). After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). Leigh next sought the role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage production of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and was cast after Williams and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in The School for Scandal and Antigone; Olivier was contracted to direct. The play contained a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, and was destined to be controversial; the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work. When the West End production of Streetcar opened in October 1949, J. B. Priestley denounced the play and Leigh's performance; and the critic Kenneth Tynan, who was to make a habit of dismissing her stage performances, commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were \\"too well-bred to emote effectively on stage\\". Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious story, rather than the Greek tragedy that they envisioned. The play also had strong supporters, among them Noel Coward, who described Leigh as \\"magnificent\\". After 326 performances, Leigh finished her run, and she was soon assigned to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in the film version of the play. Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with Brando, but she had an initial difficulty in working with director Elia Kazan, who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche. Kazan had favoured Jessica Tandy and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche. He later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress, believing that \\"she had a small talent.\\" As work progressed, however, he became \\"full of admiration\\" for \\"the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance.\\" Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the Los Angeles Times, \\"I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me.\\" Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with Jennifer Jones in William Wyler's Carrie (1952). Leigh's performance in A Streetcar Named Desire won glowing reviews, as well as a second Academy Award for Best Actress, a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best British Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role \\"everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of\\". Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois \\"tipped me over into madness\\".

Output:","completion":"General Charles Cornwallis was a British military leader who played a significant role in the American Revolution. He was born on December 31, 1738, in London, England, and came from an aristocratic family. Cornwallis joined the British Army at the age of 18 and quickly rose through the ranks. He was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the 12th Foot Regiment in 1766 and eventually attained the rank of Lieutenant General in 1775. During the American Revolution, Cornwallis was appointed as second-in-command to General Sir Henry Clinton. He arrived in America in 1776 and was involved in several key battles, including the Battle of Long Island, the Battle of Brandywine, and the Battle of Germantown. In 1780, he took over command of British forces in the southern colonies, where he was tasked with consolidating British control and bolstering Loyalist support. Despite initial successes, Cornwallis' army faced challenges such as supply shortages and growing resistance from the American Continental Army and local militia. His forces experienced a major defeat at the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781. He later regrouped and marched north to Virginia, where he hoped to cut off American supply lines and isolate the southern states. However, in October 1781, French and American forces led by General George Washington and French General Jean-Baptiste Rochambeau trapped Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia. After a brief but intense siege, Cornwallis was forced to surrender on October 19, 1781. The surrender of around 8,000 British troops marked a decisive turning point in the Revolutionary War, leading to peace negotiations and ultimately the withdrawal of British forces from America. Following the war, Cornwallis continued to serve his country in various capacities, including posts in India, Ireland, and as a member of Parliament. He died in Ghazipur, India, on October 5, 1805."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two.

This golden spice isn't just for cooking anymore; incorporating it into your skincare routine can provide numerous benefits. Homemade turmeric soap with melt-and-pour soap base makes it easy to take advantage of this powerful ingredient. In this article, we'll guide you through the simple steps to create your custom turmeric soap that's not only beneficial for your skin but also perfect for gifting. Materials required: 1. Melt-and-pour soap base (glycerin or shea butter) 2. Ground turmeric 3. Essential oil or soap making fragrance oil (optional) 4. Exfoliant (optional) 5. Microwave-safe bowl 6. Rubber spatula 7. Soap molds (plastic or silicone) 8. Measuring cups and spoons 9. Knife Step 1: Cut the melt-and-pour soap base Begin by cutting the melt-and-pour soap base into 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) chunks using a knife. This will help the soap base melt evenly in the microwave. The amount of soap base needed will depend on the size of your mold; refer to the instructions that came with the mold or weigh it as necessary. Step 2: Melt the soap base Place the soap chunks in a microwave-safe bowl. Melt the soap base in the microwave, using 30-second intervals to avoid overheating. Stir between each interval until the soap has entirely melted. Be cautious while handling the melted soap, as it will be hot. Step 3: Stir in the ground turmeric Turmeric delivers an array of skin benefits, such as reducing inflammation and promoting an even skin tone. Carefully measure 1 to 2 teaspoons of ground turmeric and stir it into the melted soap base. Adjust the quantity according to your skin sensitivity and the color you desire for your soap. Thoroughly mix the turmeric until well-distributed. Step 4: Add fragrance and exfoliants (optional) To enhance your soap's aroma, incorporate essential oils or soap making fragrance oils. Depending on your preferences, you can choose calming scents like lavender, energizing scents like citrus, or even woodsy scents like cedarwood. Add 8 to 12 drops of the chosen essential oil and stir it into the soap mixture. If desired, you can further customize your soap by adding an exfoliant. Options include oatmeal, coffee grounds, or coarse sea salt. Adding an exfoliant will provide a gentle scrubbing effect, which promotes circulation and removes dead skin cells. Combine 1 to 2 tablespoons of your chosen exfoliant and mix thoroughly. Step 5: Pour the soap into the mold Prepare your soap mold by ensuring it is clean and dry. Slowly pour the soap mixture into each cavity of the mold. To minimize air bubbles, use a rubber spatula to gently stir the soap as you pour. Fill all the cavities until the mold reaches capacity. Step 6: Tap the mold and let it cool After filling the mold, tap it gently on the counter or tabletop to release any trapped air bubbles. Then allow the soap to cool and harden for 12 to 24 hours. This allows it to set properly and ensures easy removal from the mold. Step 7: De-mold and enjoy your soap Once the soap has cooled and hardened, it's time to de-mold. Carefully press on the bottom of the mold, flexing it, to release the soap. If you're using a plastic mold, run a knife around the soap's edges to help it release. With your turmeric soap ready, you can now enjoy its beautifying and rejuvenating properties for your skin. These soaps also make great gifts for friends and family, as they're handmade with love and care. So, go ahead and pamper yourself or your loved ones with this luxurious, easy-to-make turmeric soap!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This young and talented team, aptly named the \\"Whiz Kids,\\" were led by their ace pitcher, Robin Roberts, who was an integral part of their journey to the 1950 pennant. Born on September 30, 1926, Robin Roberts would have been 83 today, and this is the perfect time to recall his remarkable career and the impact he had on one of baseball's most unforgettable teams. Early Life and Career: Robin Evan Roberts was born in Springfield, Illinois, and grew up playing baseball throughout his childhood. He later attended Michigan State University, where he not only played baseball but also basketball, demonstrating his extraordinary athletic prowess. After a short stint in the military, Roberts joined the Phillies' minor league system, where he quickly rose through the ranks and made his major league debut on June 18, 1948, at just 21 years of age. The Rise of the Whiz Kids: By the late 1940s, the Philadelphia Phillies were undergoing a major transformation. The franchise had not been successful, with their last National League pennant occurring in 1915. Despite this, their fortunes were about to change as a group of young and talented players started to emerge, including future stars like Richie Ashburn, Del Ennis, and Robin Roberts. In 1950, the unlikely happened - these \\"Whiz Kids\\" surprised everyone by winning the National League pennant. Key to this achievement were the performances of their players, including their ace pitcher - Robin Roberts. Roberts posted an impressive win-loss record of 20-11, a 3.02 ERA, and 146 strikeouts during that magical season. His tremendous stamina and determination were evident, as he completed 21 games and pitched over 300 innings - a testament to his iron arm and competitive spirit. Battle for the Pennant: The race for the 1950 National League pennant was a fiercely contested battle between the Philadelphia Phillies, the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the defending champions, the New York Giants. The Phillies managed to stay ahead of the pack thanks to the Whiz Kids' youth and the extraordinary leadership of their manager, Eddie Sawyer. As the regular season drew to an end, everything came down to the final series against the Dodgers. In the first game of the crucial series, held on September 29, 1950, Roberts was handed the ball for the Phillies. The game remained thrillingly close, with both teams hoping to clinch the pennant. In a nail-biting finish, Roberts managed to pitch the Phillies to an intense 3-1 victory over the Dodgers, essentially locking up the pennant for the Phillies with only one game remaining in the season. The train from Brooklyn to Philadelphia was dubbed the \\"happy train\\" due to the celebratory mood of the players, who knew they had accomplished something extraordinary. Legacy and Impact: Robin Roberts' stellar career with the Phillies spanned 14 seasons, from 1948 to 1961, during which he accumulated 234 wins, 199 complete games, and a lifetime ERA of 3.46. The six-time All-Star was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976, a fitting recognition for one of the game's most tenacious and beloved pitchers. The accomplishments of Roberts and the Whiz Kids in 1950 were a brief, shining moment for the Phillies' franchise, which would not win another pennant until 1980. The memory of their extraordinary pennant victory endures as a symbol of perseverance, competitiveness, and the possibilities that can be achieved when a group of young players come together under the leadership of a great pitcher like Robin Roberts. In conclusion, Robin Roberts' legacy in baseball history is well-deserved, as he was the driving force behind the remarkable 1950 Phillies' pennant victory. What makes this feat more astonishing is the fact that the team was largely made up of inexperienced, but talented players, the \\"Whiz Kids.\\" Their success serves as a tribute to their determination, teamwork, and the incredible leadership of their ace pitcher, who proved that, with hard work and a competitive spirit, anything is possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Rush was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey on April 7, 1947 to John and Alice Cowan. She grew up in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, a township with over 40,000 residents in 2010, but approximately 5,000 when she was in elementary school. Her elementary school consisted of two rooms, with a single teacher for each room. One room housed the first through third grades, while the other room was for the fourth through sixth grades. Context: The USA Basketball team had had success in the Pan American games with gold medals in 1955,1959, and 1963, but had come in second place in both 1967 and 1971. In 1975, the team was determined to win the gold, and Cathy Rush was named head coach. One of the leading players on the Pan American team was Lusia Harris, whose Delta State team had beaten Immaculata in the 1975 Championship game, and would do so again in 1976. There were other notable players on the team, such as Pat Head (Summitt), Ann Meyers and others, as well as a 17-year-old high school player, Nancy Lieberman. The games were originally planned for Chile, then Brazil when Chile withdrew the offer to host, and then Mexico City, where they were eventually held in October. The team roster and coaches were identical to the US National team that placed eighth in the World Championships, held a few weeks earlier. That team finished with a disappointing 4-3 record, but lost the three games by a total of nine points. The USA's team first opponent was Mexico, a team that finished ahead of the USA at the World Championships, and would end up the silver medal winning in this competition. The USA team beat them 99-65, setting a tone for the event. The USA next beat Canada 75-56. They followed that game with a convincing 116-28 victory over El Salvador. Their following game against Cuba was the only close game, with the USA winning by six points 70-64. The USA team then went on to defeat the Dominican Republic 99-50, and Columbia 74-48.

Question: This article: Mr. Wilson of the United Nations War Crimes Commission is hunting for Nazi fugitive Franz Kindler, a war criminal who has erased all evidence which might identify him, with no clue left to his identity except \\"a hobby that almost amounts to a mania—clocks.\\" Wilson releases Kindler's former associate Meinike, hoping the man will lead him to Kindler. Wilson follows Meinike to the United States, to the town of Harper, Connecticut, but loses him before he meets with Kindler. Kindler has assumed a new identity and is known locally as \\"Charles Rankin,\\" and has become a prep school teacher. He is about to marry Mary Longstreet, daughter of Supreme Court Justice Adam Longstreet, and is involved in repairing the town's 400-year-old Habrecht-style clock mechanism with religious automata that crowns the belfry of a church in the town square. When Kindler and Meinike do meet, Meinike, who is repentant, begs Kindler to confess his crimes. Instead, Kindler strangles Meinike, who might expose him. Eventually, Wilson deduces that Rankin is Kindler, but not having witnessed the meeting with Meinike, he has no proof. Only Mary knows that Meinike came to meet her husband. To get her to admit this, Wilson must convince her that her husband is a criminal—before Rankin decides to eliminate the threat to him by killing her. Kindler's pose begins to unravel when Red, the family dog, discovers Meinike's body.

News article: Ehud Olmert, Ex-Israeli Leader, Indicted on Bribery Charge JERUSALEM — Ehud Olmert, who resigned as prime minister of Israel in 2008 amid corruption charges, was indicted on Thursday for allegedly taking bribes in the construction of a huge residential complex while he was mayor of Jerusalem. Mr. Olmert, who is on trial for three unrelated counts of fraud and breach of trust from before his tenure as prime minister, has denied all wrongdoing. In the newest and by far most serious indictment, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to smooth the way for construction of the Holyland, an enormous hulk of a residential complex in southwestern Jerusalem. When the case was first made public nearly two years ago, the presiding judge called it “one of the worst corruption affairs in Israeli history.” The Holyland is built on a ridge with interlocking apartment buildings and one outsized tower that dominates the landscape for miles and is widely considered an eyesore. Jerusalem residents commonly call it “the monster.” Millions of dollars are said to have changed hands to allow the project to go up in a hurry and to grow to more than 12 times the height granted by the original permits. Mr. Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003 and was then the government minister with oversight over the Israel Lands Authority. In the Holyland indictment, Mr. Olmert is one of a number of people listed. The others include another former Jerusalem mayor, Uri Lupolianski, and the former director of the Israel Lands Authority, Yaakov Efrati. Mr. Olmert became acting prime minister in early 2006 when Ariel Sharon suffered a pair of debilitating strokes. He ran shortly thereafter as head of the Kadima Party and was elected prime minister. He resigned in September 2008 after police recommended he be indicted in several cases of corruption. He became acting prime minister until elections in early 2009 when Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud formed the current government. Mr. Olmert’s other indictments relate to allegations that he accepted envelopes of cash from an American businessman and that he double-billed Israeli organizations for trips abroad, all before his election as prime minister. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about Ehud Olmert, a former leader of Israel, who is in trouble because he is accused of doing something very wrong called bribery. Bribery is when someone takes money or gifts in exchange for doing something for the person who gave the money or gift. In this case, Ehud Olmert is accused of taking lots of money to make it easier for a big building project called the Holyland to be built quickly. This building is not very liked by people in Jerusalem and is called \\"the monster\\". Ehud Olmert was the mayor of Jerusalem when this happened and later became the prime minister of Israel. But he had to leave his job as prime minister because he was accused of doing other wrong things too.

Dismissing someone in the context of marriage suggests that the marriage was terminated, while repudiating someone also means a rejection or ending of the marital relationship. The difference in the two sentences lies in the choice of the verb used to convey the dissolution of the marriage. Dismissing might suggest a less harsh approach to ending a relationship, while repudiating could carry a stronger tone indicating a more public or severe separation. However, the key information about the marriage and its end remains the same in both sentences.

(WIVB) — One woman died as she was trying to rescue two girls from Lake Erie Thursday. Town of Evans Police have identified her as 51-year-old Mary Creighton of Buffalo. Creighton tried to help a 10-year-old girl and her 11-year-old daughter, but drowned. When Lieutenant Bradley DiMartino got on the scene he saw someone’s head at least 100 yards out at Wendt Beach. He pulled the 11-year-old to safety and had some trouble due to the high waves. Officer Jeffrey DeVinney ran in and rescued both of them. Town of Evans Police Chief Ernest Masullo said his officers acted heroically. “My officers immediately started looking, running up and down the beach,” he said. “They did notice a young girl bobbing in the water and one of my lieutenants stripped his uniform, stripped his firearm, and ran into the water about a hundred yards out and grabbed the girl. He became in trouble and one of my other officers ran in and rescued both of them.” Police said the 10-year-old girl was able to make her way to the shore on her own. They also stressed that the waves made it difficult for everyone to get out. “This type of wave action will literally pull you right out, you get an undertow,” said Nick Mecca, the North Evans Fire district chief . “I don’t know if those were the circumstances here, but you get large waves and it pulls people out into deeper water.” Lake Erie’s waves were nearly five feet tall and winds were gusting up to 26.8 miles per hour during the time of the search, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Police said this all started when people on the beach called 911 around 7:00 p.m. when they realized they couldn’t see the girls out in the water. Several agencies responded to the call including Lake Erie Beach Volunteer Fire Department, Hamburg Water Rescue Unit, U.S. Coast Guard, and Air One from the Erie County Sheriff’s Office. Conditions were so severe, officials said, a rescue boat capsized in the search. Rescue Crews told News 4 the children were taken by ambulance to Women and Children’s Hospital. County Executive Mark Poloncarz said swimming is not allowed at Wendt Beach so there were no life guards on duty. ||||| DERBY, N.Y.

Mary Creighton, 51, of Buffalo saw her 11-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old girl struggling in the water and went into Lake Erie to try to rescue both. The 10-year-old girl made it out of the water before first responders arrived. When Evans Police Lt. Bradley DiMartino got to the beach, he saw Creighton in the water with her daughter and swam in to help. Lt. DiMartino grabbed the 11-year-old girl and pulled her to safety. Officer Jeffery DeVinney helped bring her to shore. Creighton was swept out by the current and high waves. At the time, Lake Erie was experiencing 5-foot to 6-foot waves. Erie County Sheriff's Air One helicopter circled the beach, looking for the Creighton, while the U.S. Coast Guard and first responders on jetskis searched the water. Her body was found about an hour later. \\"That's what this job is. You're here to protect life and these officers acted in the spur of he moment and risked their own lives. Every day they risk their lives and the officer is pretty upset they couldn't save the mother,\\" Evans Police Chief Ernie Masullo said. Both of the girls were conscious and alert when they were taken to Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo. They are expected to be okay.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. The name Uwe Boll is automatically linked to bad horror/cult cinema and every new movie he releases  which is about two, three per year  immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism. You're actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype. You know, like it's popular to hate Uwe Boll whether you liked his movies or not. Let me just assure you that this is NOT the case. Uwe Boll is a terrible writer/director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film-making industry. \\"Seed\\" is another most unfortunate of proof that. In here, Boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist, like a plot, a narrative structure, character development, tension building \\"Seed\\" is a hideous movie, full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage. I once read that \\"Seed\\" was Uwe Boll's interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of Torture Porn flicks, but that's not even close. The film inarguably does borrow some influences from \\"Saw\\" and \\"Hostel\\", but basically it's just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence. The first 45 minutes of \\"Seed\\" are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen. For you see, Boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a (hyper- fast) scrolling text explaining there's a federal US law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail. So you know this will happen later on, but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair. Seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims (exaggerate much?) who wears a bag over his head. He watches real-life animal cruelty footage (and thus WE watch real-life animal cruelty footage; thanks for that Mr. Boll) and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar (including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted). When he's finally captured, during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed, and put on death row, the film even becomes more retarded. After being buried alive because the electric chair couldn't fry him, Max Seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree; this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him. The senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad; they're downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic. Multiple twists and sub plot in \\"Seed\\" are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they're just too dumb! Nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first. Nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him! \\"Seed\\" is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes. Personally, I refuse to accept that the cast & crew members didn't notice this as well. It really makes you think that Uwe Boll simply neglects all advice and criticism, and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to. I imagine his yelling stuff like \\"shut up and do as you are told\\" to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they're shooting doesn't make a lick of sense. Just for the fun of upsetting people, there's a gigantically overlong sequence where Max Seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she's tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room. Instead of shocking, as Boll intended it to be, this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is. \\"Seed\\" is horrendous, it's disgusting, it's pitiable, it's  Boll. Output:","completion":"Based on the content of the movie review, I would classify it as a negative review. The reviewer uses strong negative language and criticism throughout the review, describing the movie as \\"hideous,\\" \\"full of gratuitous filth,\\" \\"infuriating,\\" and \\"insulting.\\" Additionally, they criticize the director, Uwe Boll, for his poor writing and direction, as well as the movie's lack of plot, character development, and tension building. Overall, this review indicates a strong disapproval of the movie and its handling by the director."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, proclaimed in 1983 following Turkey's military occupation of the northern third of the island, is recognized only by Turkey itself. This stand of the global community is due to the violation of international law represented by the unilateral declaration of independence, which occurred after forced displacement of a part of the population and other unlawful acts.

Here are possible answers to this question: - deep sea - slaughterhouse - cattle ranch - countryside - barnyard I believe the correct choice is \\"cattle ranch\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"cattle ranch\\". Cowboys were primarily responsible for herding and tending to cattle, particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries in North America. Their main task was to move cattle from one location to another, usually towards a ranch where the cattle would graze, breed, and be raised for various purposes, including consumption and sale. Let's take a closer look at each of the options given: 1. Deep sea - This is not a suitable location for cowboys to herd heifers, as cattle are land animals and would not survive in a deep-sea environment. Cowboys were not involved in maritime activities as their primary focus was on the land. 2. Slaughterhouse - While some cattle ultimately end up at a slaughterhouse, cowboys were not responsible for transporting heifers directly there. Their primary role was to tend to the cattle on the ranch and move them between grazing areas. 3. Cattle ranch - This is the correct option. Cowboys were responsible for herding cattle, including heifers, across property towards a cattle ranch. Here, the cattle would graze, breed, and be raised for various purposes. 4. Countryside - Cowboys did operate in the countryside, but the more accurate description of their destination would be a cattle ranch rather than just the general countryside. 5. Barnyard - Barnyards are typically found in farming and ranching operations, but they are not the overall destination for cowboys herding heifers. A barnyard may be a part of a cattle ranch, but the broader term \\"cattle ranch\\" is more appropriate for this context. In summary, cowboys herded heifers across the property towards a cattle ranch, where cattle would graze and be raised for various purposes.

It is revealed that while they were there, James proposed to Kristen and she refused, claiming she is not ready for marriage yet. James calls his friend Mike to come pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4 a.m., there is a knock at the door, surprising to them both since the house is so remote and far from any civilisation for miles.

While passengers may generally decline AIT screening in favor of physical screening, TSA may direct mandatory AIT screening for some passengers. AIT is “Advanced Imaging Technology,” or the large screening machines you’ve been through if you’ve taking a flight in the past few years, which are used to detect “threat objects carried on persons.” In the past, the option to opt out of AIT body scan and have an agent perform a physical inspection instead was guaranteed. While the new policy reassures that passengers “generally will have the option to decline an AIT screening in favor of physical screening,” the TSA will now be able to “direct mandatory AIT screening for some passengers as warranted by security considerations in order to safeguard transportation security.” What security considerations would warrant mandatory screening aren’t outlined. The new policy seems to stem from the use of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) software, which the agency says “display the location of the object on a generic figure as opposed to displaying the image of the individual.” The plans to adopt the technology were announced several years ago, and it’s been rolled out over the past couple of years. Older scanners displayed a “naked” figure of the person being scanned. I’ve reached out to the DHS for more information on what sorts of security considerations would prompt mandatory screening, and will update this story if they reply. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

This change aims to safeguard transportation security. The specific security factors warranting mandatory screening are not outlined.

Answer the following question: As a science experiment for his school homework, Kendra is putting two ice cubes on separate pans and then putting those pans on burners set to different temperatures. Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ice cube will melt faster? Hint: For most substances, when the temperature of the solid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a liquid, and when the temperature of the liquid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a gas. We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point . Answer:","completion":"Ice cube B will melt faster. The explanation for this is based on the principles of thermodynamics. Specifically, when heat is added to a solid like an ice cube, it increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules within the ice. This increased kinetic energy causes the molecules to move faster and with greater energy, eventually overcoming the attractive forces that maintain the solid state. Once these forces are overcome, the ice begins to melt, transitioning from a solid to a liquid. In Kendra's experiment, the burner under Ice cube B is set to a higher temperature than the one under Ice cube A. This means more heat is transferred to Ice cube B, causing its molecules to gain kinetic energy more quickly than the molecules of Ice cube A. With a higher kinetic energy, the molecules of Ice cube B will overcome their attractive forces and begin to melt faster than Ice cube A. This is based on understanding that the melting point of a substance is the point at which its particles can exist in the liquid form. Therefore, the main principle justifying this answer is that the rate of a substance's phase change (in this case, from solid to liquid) is proportional to the amount of thermal energy supplied to it."},{"prompt":"Q: I heard that Taylor realized they were out of bread so they went to the store to get more.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes.

Both sentences describe irregular menstruation, menstrual disorders whose manifestations involve abnormalities in cycle lengths and bleeding between expected periods (metrorragia). However, there are subtle distinctions between the two statements. First Sentence: Irregular menstruation is a vaginal disorder whose manifestations contain menstrual cycle lengths as well as metrorragia (irregular bleeding between expected periods). In this sentence, irregular menstruation is referred to as a \\"vaginal disorder.\\" This implies that the problem is primarily associated with the vagina, which may not be accurate since it's more of a menstrual irregularity related to the entire reproductive system, rather than just the vagina. Moreover, it states that the manifestations \\"contain\\" menstrual cycle lengths and metrorragia, indicating that these two factors are included within the set of possible symptoms or implications of the disorder. Second Sentence: Irregular menstruation is a menstrual disorder whose manifestations include irregular cycle lengths as well as metrorragia (vaginal bleeding between expected periods). This sentence presents a more accurate description of irregular menstruation as a \\"menstrual disorder\\" rather than a vaginal disorder. This highlights the fact that the issue involves the entire menstrual cycle and that it's not strictly limited to the vagina. Additionally, the use of the word \\"include\\" suggests that the manifestations encompass irregular cycle lengths and metrorragia among other possible symptoms, making it more comprehensive. In summary, while both sentences discuss the same topic of irregular menstruation and its manifestations, the second sentence provides a clearer and more precise description as it correctly refers to the condition as a \\"menstrual disorder\\" and uses the term \\"include\\" to convey the range of manifestations. The first sentence, on the other hand, places more emphasis on the vagina while providing similar information about the disorder's manifestations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Nostoc is a genus of cyanobacteria found in various environments that forms colonies composed of filaments of moniliform cells in a gelatinous sheath. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Glomeromycota (informally glomeromycetes) is one of seven currently recognized divisions within the kingdom Fungi, with approximately 230 described species. Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) with the roots or thalli (e.g. in bryophytes) of land plants. \\"Geosiphon pyriformis\\" forms an endocytobiotic association with \\"Nostoc\\" cyanobacteria, and is the only member of the Glomeromycota known not to form arbuscular mycorrhiza in association with plants. AM formation has not yet been shown for all species. The majority of evidence shows that the Glomeromycota are symbionts with land plants (\\"Nostoc\\" in the case of \\"Geosiphon\\") for carbon and energy, but there is recent circumstantial evidence that some species may be able to lead an independent existence. The arbuscular mycorrhizal species are terrestrial and widely distributed in soils worldwide where they form symbioses with the roots of the majority of plant species (>80%). They can also be found in wetlands, including salt-marshes, and associated with epiphytic plants. - An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (plural \\"mycorrhizae\\" or \\"mycorrhizas\\", a.k.a. \\"endomycorrhiza\\", \\"AM fungi\\", or AMF) is a type of mycorrhiza in which the fungus penetrates the cortical cells of the roots of a vascular plant. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are characterized by the formation of unique structures, arbuscules and vesicles by fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota. AM fungi help plants to capture nutrients such as phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and micronutrients from the soil. It is believed that the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the initial colonisation of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants. - The Diversisporales are an order of generally hypogeous ( underground ) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi within the division Glomeromycota . Many have vesicles for energy storage , or auxiliary cells . Species produce a wide range of spore types , hence the name . - Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes (land plants) that are non-vascular plants, namely the mosses, hornworts, and liverworts. The defining features of bryophytes are that their life cycles are dominated by the gametophyte stage, that their sporophytes are unbranched and that they do not have a true vascular tissue containing lignin, although some have specialized tissues for the transport of water. Bryophytes are usually considered to be a paraphyletic group and not a natural (monophyletic) group, although some studies have produced contrary results. Regardless of their status, the name is convenient and remains in use as an informal collective term. Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they produce neither flowers nor seeds, reproducing via spores. The term \\"bryophyte\\" comes from Greek , \\"bryon\\", \\"tree-moss, oyster-green\\" + \\"phyton\\" \\"plant\\". - A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'diversisporales'?

We have this equation: 0 = -15*j + 10*j - 25 First, let's look at the -15*j and 10*j. We have \\"j\\" in both parts, so we can combine them: -15*j + 10*j is same as (-15 + 10) * j, which equals -5*j.

We can do this by adding 25 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 25 = -5*j - 25 + 25 This simplifies to: 25 = -5*j Now, let's find out what \\"j\\" is. To do this, we need to get rid of the -5 in front of the \\"j\\". We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -5. 25 / -5 = (-5*j) / -5 This simplifies to: -5 = j So, j equals -5.

Here is a news article: In an exclusive report published last summer, we revealed that Tesla started offering custom car insurance to its customers in Australia and Hong Kong. At the time, the company didn’t want to comment on the new venture, but that changed yesterday during the earnings conference call. CEO Elon Musk and President Jon McNeill confirmed that they plan to expand the program and have it match the progress of the Autopilot, which should reduce insurance rates to match its lower accident rate. When referencing Musk’s recent claim that Tesla’s second generation Autopilot could reduce the crash rate by 90% following the revelation that Tesla’s first generation Autopilot reduced the crash rate by about 40%, analyst Adam Jonas asked: “if your cars prove to be as much as 90% safer than other cars on a per mile basis, as I think you’ve alluded as a reasonable target in the near-term, and if insurance companies only offer your customers, say, a piddling 5% discount versus a comparably priced car, would you consider offering a service or product like PNC Insurance directly to Tesla owners from your own platform and you own stores?” Someone missed our report from last year. Jon McNeill, President of Sales and Services, responded: “We’re actually currently doing that. We’ve been doing it quietly, but in Asia in particular where we started this the majority of Tesla cars are now sold with an insurance product that is customized to Tesla that takes into account – not only the Autopilot safety features – but also the maintenance costs of the car. It’s our vision in the future that we will be able to offer a single price for the car, maintenance, and insurance in a really compelling offering for the consumer – and we’re currently doing that today.” The fact that they want to package everything into a single offering is an interesting new information. Here’s the brochure for Tesla’s plan that we obtained for our report last year: Musk added that while Tesla was venturing in the insurance business, it’s doing it in partnership with established insurers and he thinks that their rate will follow the falling rate of accidents: “Not to the exclusion of insurance providers but if we find that insurance providers are not matching the insurance proportionate to the risk of the car, then if we need to, we will in-source it. I think we will find that insurance providers do adjust the insurance cost proportionate to the risk of a Tesla.” In Hong Kong, Tesla is partnering with AXA General Insurance for its new program called InsureMyTesla and in Australia, the automaker released its new plan with QBE Insurance. It’s reportedly already lowering the cost. In Australia, some owners have reported being offered plans starting at 1,200 AUD per year (~900 USD). That was pre-second generation Autopilot. It will be interesting to see how it evolves with the system. ||||| Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Tesla wants to bundle insurance and maintenance into the price of future vehicles. Tesla has actually been quietly experimenting with this model in Asia by selling cars with insurance and maintenance included, Jon McNeill, Tesla's president of sales and services, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. \\"It takes into account not only the Autopilot safety features but also the maintenance cost of the car,\\" McNeill said. \\"It's our vision in the future we could offer a single price for the car, maintenance, and insurance.\\" There's been some discussion regarding how insurance models could change if cars are getting safer with self-driving features. The general thought is if self-driving cars reduce the number of collisions, there should be a reduction in the risk premium. Insurers like Cincinnati Financial, Mercury General, and Travelers have noted in SEC filings that driverless cars could threaten their business models, according to a 2015 Bank of America and Merrill Lynch report. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crash rates for Tesla vehicles have plummeted 40% since Autopilot was first installed. \\"If we find that the insurance providers are not matching the insurance proportionate to the risk of the car then if we need to we will in-source it,\\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on the earnings call. \\"But I think we'll find that insurance providers do adjust the insurance cost proportionate to the risk of a Tesla.\\" Electrek reports that Tesla has partnered with AXA General Insurance for its program InsureMyTesla. In Australia, Tesla has partnered with QBE Insurance on the insurance plan. ||||| In the self-driving future envisioned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, car owners might be saying \\"goodbye\\" to a whole lot more than steering wheels. Musk is so sure of the safety features bundled into Tesla vehicles that his company has begun offering some customers a lifetime insurance and maintenance package at the time of purchase. No more monthly insurance bills. No more unexpected repair costs. The news was dropped Wednesday in an earnings call, and suggests that Tesla executives believe they are uniquely qualified to change the way new cars are priced and purchased. \\"We’ve been doing it quietly,\\" Tesla President of Global Sales and Service Jonathan McNeill explained on the call, \\"but in Asia in particular where we started this, now the majority of Tesla cars are sold with an insurance product that is customized to Tesla, that takes into account not only the Autopilot safety features but also the maintenance costs of the car.\\" Elon Musk's serious face. Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images It's important to note that, like so many things in life, this service isn't free. Rather, the cost of lifetime insurance and maintenance is built into the initial purchase price. Even so, that gives customers a straightforward way of knowing how much a new Tesla will actually cost in the long run. And if the Tesla autopilot feature makes the cars safer, as the company has asserted it does, insurance rates may theoretically be less expensive than for a typical non-autonomous vehicle. It's unclear how much the lifetime insurance and maintenance bundle costs. We reached out to Tesla for clarification, but have yet to hear back. \\"It’s our vision in the future that we’ll be able to offer a single price for the car, maintenance and insurance in a really compelling offering for the consumer,\\" added McNeill. \\"And we’re currently doing that today.\\" Musk insisted that this move is not about disrupting the insurance market — as long as insurance companies agree to play nice. \\"If we need to we’ll insource it,\\" he said of the included insurance plan, \\"but I think we’ll find that insurance partners do adjust rates proportionate to the risk of a Tesla.\\" No word yet on when this offering will become widely available, but as Tesla has shown time and time again, the company has a habit of following through on bold predictions. UPDATE: Feb. 23, 2017, 1:32 p.m. PST The top quote in this story was initially attributed to Tesla VP of Global Investor Relations Jeff Evanson. The quote in fact comes from Tesla President of Global Sales and Service Jonathan McNeill. This post has also been updated to note that we reached out to Tesla for clarification on costs. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Tesla, a company that makes electric cars, is planning to offer insurance and maintenance for their cars in a single package. The important part here is that they believe their cars are much safer than others on the road, mainly because of their self-driving feature called \\"Autopilot\\". The safer the car is, the less money it costs to insure it. So, Tesla is saying that if their cars are safer, customers should get a better deal on insurance. Because of this, they are working with some insurance companies like AXA and QBE to give a combined insurance and maintenance plan for some of their new cars. They hope that in the future, they can have a single price for the car, insurance and maintenance, making it easier and more affordable for people who buy their cars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which famous Indian became known as Rebecca Rolfe and died in Gravesend in Kent?","completion":"Pocahontas, born as Amonute and later known as Rebecca Rolfe, was a Native American woman who was closely associated with the British colonial settlement of Jamestown, Virginia. Pocahontas belonged to the Powhatan tribe, and her father, Wahunsenacawh (more commonly known as Chief Powhatan), was the paramount chief of the Powhatan tribal confederation. She was born in around 1596 and her name, Pocahontas, means \\"playful one\\" or \\"mischievous one.\\" Pocahontas became famous for her connections to the British colony at Jamestown and, in particular, to English settler Captain John Smith. According to historical accounts, Pocahontas saved Smith's life during a conflict between the English settlers and the Powhatan Confederacy by placing her own body over his just as her father was about to execute him. However, it should be noted that the authenticity of this story has been questioned by many historians, and it is widely believed to be a romanticized version of events. Regardless of the veracity of this story, Pocahontas played a vital role in maintaining relations between the Jamestown settlers and her native Powhatan people. She acted as a peacemaker, negotiator, and even a translator at times. In 1613, Pocahontas was captured by the British and initially held for ransom. During her captivity, she was converted to Christianity and baptized as Rebecca. It was during this time that she met and married an English settler named John Rolfe in 1614, taking his last name and thus becoming known as Rebecca Rolfe. The marriage of Rebecca (Pocahontas) and John Rolfe created a temporary peace between the colonists and the Powhatan tribes. In 1616, they traveled to England, where Rebecca was introduced as a Native American princess. Her visit to England was an attempt to strengthen the relationship between the Jamestown settlers and the English people and to encourage more financial investments in the American colony. During their stay in England, the Rolfes were planning to return to Virginia when Rebecca suddenly fell ill. Although the exact cause of her illness is unknown, it is believed to have been pneumonia, tuberculosis, or some other respiratory disease. Tragically, she passed away on March 21, 1617, in the English town of Gravesend in Kent, aged approximately 20 or 21 years. Pocahontas was laid to rest at St. George's Church, Gravesend, but the exact location of her grave remains uncertain. Pocahontas has left an enduring legacy as an icon of Native American culture, and her life has been portrayed in numerous books, films, and paintings. While her Rebecca Rolfe persona and connection to the English settlement represent a complex and controversial part of her life, she remains a symbol of the rich and complex cultural interactions that occurred during the earliest encounters between European settlers and Native Americans in the United States."},{"prompt":"A doctor can prescribe an antibiotic in many forms, what type might have a gel coating? - cure bacterial infection - medicine cabinet - capsule - prescribed - pharmacy The best answer is","completion":"capsule."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What do the boundaries between reality and fiction become in this movie? Movie title: The Stunt Man Movie plot: Cameron (Steve Railsback) is a young veteran running from the police. He stumbles onto the set of a World War I movie and isn't sure if he has accidentally caused the death of one of the film's stunt men. The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene. The final day of filming involves a complicated stunt where Cameron has to drive a vintage Duesenberg off a bridge. Nina has two other scenes to shoot as well, but Cameron is convinced Eli will rig the stunt so he will die. He persuades Nina to run away with him, but they are unable to leave the set, which is kept sealed from the neighboring town by the police on Eli's orders. Nina hides in the trunk of the Duesenberg, promising to slip away with Cameron during the stunt. Before the scene is shot, Eli points to the Duesenberg and explains it is the only copy of the vintage car that the production has. He therefore orders that no one interrupt the filming of... Answer:","completion":"In \\"The Stunt Man,\\" the boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred, making it difficult to distinguish between what is truly happening and what is part of the movie production. This is primarily due to the manipulation and control of the eccentric director, Eli Cross, who exercises his godlike control over every aspect of the production and the lives of the characters. Throughout the movie, Cameron, the main character, faces situations where it is unclear if the danger he experiences is real or just another part of the film's elaborately staged stunts. As the film progresses, his suspicions grow, further confusing the distinction between reality and fiction. This is exacerbated by his relationships with other characters, such as Nina Franklin, and the manipulations of the director, Eli Cross. Ultimately, the boundaries between reality and fiction in \\"The Stunt Man\\" serve to create a sense of paranoia and uncertainty, capturing the protagonist's experience on the film set as he struggles to discern the truth and find an escape from the oppressive control of the director."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Input: In Winnetka, Illinois, a quiet and affluent suburb of Chicago, the McCallister family is preparing for a Christmas vacation in Miami. On the night before their departure, the entire family gathers at Peter and Kate's home, where their 10-year-old son Kevin sees Florida as contradictory to Christmas because he thinks there are no Christmas trees in Florida. During the school Christmas pageant, Kevin's older brother Buzz humiliates him during his solo, causing Kevin to retaliate. Refusing to apologize for his actions, Kevin goes up to the third floor of the house. During the night, Peter unknowingly causes the alarm clock to reset; consequently, the family once again oversleeps. In the confusion and rush to reach the O'Hare Airport on time, Kevin boards a flight bound for New York City while trying to replace the batteries for his tape recorder, carrying Peter's bag containing his wallet and a large amount of cash; upon arrival in Miami, Kate realizes that Kevin is missing again. In New York, Kevin tours the city and convinces the staff at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, into renting him a room using Peter's credit card. During a visit to Central Park, Kevin is frightened by the appearance of a homeless woman tending to pigeons.On Christmas Eve, Kevin tours the city in a limousine and visits a toy store where he meets its philanthropic owner, Mr. Duncan. Kevin learns that the proceeds from the store's Christmas sales will be donated to a children's hospital. Duncan offers Kevin a pair of ceramic turtledoves as a gift, instructing him to give one to another person as a sign of eternal friendship. After encountering Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who recently escaped from prison and are now called the \\"Sticky Bandits,\\" Kevin retreats to the Plaza. The hotel's concierge Mr. Hector confronts Kevin about the credit card which has been reported stolen. Kevin flees after evading Mr. Hector, but is captured by Harry and Marv. The duo discuss plans for breaking into the toy store that night, before Kevin escapes.Kevin's family travels to New York after tracking the whereabouts of the stolen credit card and Kate searches the city for Kevin. Meanwhile, Kevin goes to his uncle Rob's townhouse only to find the house vacant and undergoing renovations while Rob and his family are in Paris. In Central Park, he encounters the pigeon lady. When Kevin gets his foot caught while running away, she frees him. At Carnegie Hall, the pair watch an orchestra perform \\"O Come, All ye Faithful.\\"[3] The pigeon lady explains how her life collapsed and how she dealt with it by taking care of the pigeons in the park. Kevin gives the pigeon lady some advice and promises that he will be her friend.Kevin, after remembering what the bandits said, returns to the townhouse and rigs it with numerous booby traps. Kevin arrives at the toy store during Harry and Marv's robbery, throws a brick through the window, setting off the store's alarm. Kevin then lures the duo to the townhouse, where he springs the traps and Harry and Marv suffer various injuries. When the duo chase Kevin around the townhouse, he escapes and calls the police on a payphone. Harry and Marv catch him take him down to Central Park to kill him, but the pigeon lady sneaks in and incapacitates the duo with her birdseed before they can do anything, and Kevin sets off fireworks he had bought earlier to signal the police.

Thomas Michael Cousineau (born May 6, 1957) is an American former college and professional football player who was a linebacker in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons during the 1970s and 1980s. He played college football for Ohio State University, and twice earned All-American honors. He was the first overall pick of the 1979 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the CFL's Montreal Alouettes and the NFL's Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers. Cousineau is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, elected in the class of 2016. Cousineau attended Ohio State University, where he played for legendary coach Woody Hayes' Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 1975 to 1978. During that span, Ohio State had an overall record of 36-10-2 and 28-4 in the Big Ten, were three-time Big Ten champs. The Buckeyes played four bowl games after each of the seasons he played: in the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl and Gator Bowl. They were a Top 5 team for 36 weeks over these four years and the No. 1 team in the nation for eight weeks in 1975, and ultimately finished fourth, sixth and 12th in the final Associated Press polls in 1975, 1976 and 1977, respectively. Cousineau majored in marketing. It is rumored that he frequently ate Ken Boock's lunch while attending Ohio State. He was a consensus first-team All-American, breaking the school record with 211 tackles in a single season in 1978, an average of 17.5 a game. He also broke the school record for most tackles in a game with 29 against Penn State in 1978, and was the MVP of the 1977 Orange Bowl. Cousineau's last game for the Buckeyes was the infamous 1978 Gator Bowl against Clemson, during which Coach Hayes punched Clemson linebacker Charlie Bauman in the final minutes of the game. Hayes was fired the following day for the incident. Cousineau still holds many of Ohio State's tackling records. As of 2016, he holds six of the top 10 single-game tackling records, 29 single-game tackles (since tied by fellow College Football Hall of Famer Chris Spielman), most solo tackles in a single game, (16 against SMU in 1978). He also ranks second on both the all-time OSU tackle list with 569 (three behind Marcus Marek) and on the career solo tackles list with 259. He was named an All-American in 1977 and 1978. The Chicago Tribune named him the MVP of the Big Ten in 1978. He graduated from OSU in 1979.

He has a broken leg and is suffering from amnesia. He hallucinates about a woman (Caroline Dhavernas) finding him. He also drives away a cougar after giving two warning shots from a revolver he retrieved inside the car. After a few days of being stuck in that position, he manages to escape the car by prying out the car door with a shifter lever. In the car, he finds bags of money and hears on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy. Finding a credit card under the passenger seat in the name of Raymond Plazzy, The Man assumes that he is Raymond Plazzy and that he committed the robbery. A man (Adrian Holmes) wearing hunting gear emerges from the woods and starts to loot the wrecked car. The Man tries to get help from the hunter, who just runs away with some of the stolen money. A dog appears, and The Man follows it into the woods. He finds a working cell phone inside a cave, discovering the tragic fate of the hunter who was possibly attacked by the cougar. The Man cannot obtain a signal in the woods. Frequently hallucinating about the woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination led him back to the car.

In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.

Summarize this article: For Mr Abramovich, the case was simply about greed - a well paid political fixer who got well above his station and who treated the Chelsea Football Club owner like a cash cow. It took four months to get through the acrid testimonies of both oligarchs, and a further five to get a ruling. The evidence was so complex that, had the documents not been digitised, it is estimated the courtroom would have been awash with more than five million sheets of paper. Above everything, says costs lawyer Jim Diamond, this was a case that smacked of money. \\"It is - according to the grapevine of the legal profession - the most expensive legal case involving individuals in the history of the world,\\" says Mr Diamond. \\"You have got two very, very wealthy people who are really throwing every single resource at the particular exercise. \\"If you look at a combination of rates of the lawyers - anywhere between £200-250 to £600 or £700 an hour - in the city. And if you have teams of 40 or 50 people, you can understand how these cases can become very, very expensive. \\"So it wouldn't surprise me if the cost reached £150m.\\" At the heart of the case was a longstanding dispute. Boris Berezovsky claimed he held a sizeable stake in the younger oligarch's oil and aluminium companies, and was bullied into selling those shares at a knock-down price after Roman Abramovich threatened that the Kremlin - with which Mr Berezovsky had fallen out - would seize them. The Chelsea Football Club owner maintained that Mr Berezovsky had never owned a formal stake in his companies, and had simply been employed as a political fixer to help him make the necessary connections to build up his business empire. Russian media was transfixed by the case, but not necessarily in a good way, according to Russian journalist Alexei Kovalev. \\"It's a matter of washing one's dirty linen in public, which is the reason it's so embarrassing for Russians.\\" Both of the men are, or have been, closely associated with the Russian government, which also \\"by association means its reputation is far from clean\\", the journalist said. He added: \\"You see, the absolute majority of Russians believe these two people took what didn't belong to them and sold it for their own profit.\\" The trial has shone a spotlight on what Mr Abramovich's QC called the lawless and medieval state of post-Soviet Russia, when state assets were swooped upon by a few opportunistic businessmen. Murky business practices came to light during the trial. Mr Abramovich admitted to setting up companies staffed almost entirely by disabled people in order to win tax breaks, and in turn accused Mr Berezovsky of having links with Chechnyan terrorists. Russian journalist Viktor Balagadde, who writes for the newspaper Kommersant UK, notes that neither man shied away from certain accusations of skulduggery. \\"I'm just surprised that they talked so openly and so - I don't know whether you can call it sincerely - but they were so open about the way things were working in the 1990s. \\"In this court case they are trying to use this chance to admit the way they acquired enormous sums of money. And by doing that, probably they are trying to legalise them and find a way how they can be kept.\\" The case did not make any major revelations, but the steady stream of gossip certainly made some good headlines. Mr Abramovich was described by his rival as being not very smart. It was revealed Mr Berezovsky attended a meeting at a London hotel attired in nothing more than his bathrobe. And while the older oligarch treated his legal team to sushi at lunchtime, Mr Abramovich was regularly spotted alone at the local Pret A Manger with a hummus wrap and a £1 carrot cake. Mr Balagadde says his readers have cared only for the gossip, and nothing for the outcome of the case. \\"People are just fishing for this little detail which will be turned later into jokes... I don't think there is anticipation for either Berezovsky or Abramovich winning from Russian society.\\" The case has revealed a bitter feud over massive wealth, but Mr Diamond warns it is not finished yet. \\"As night follows day, I doubt that either side is going to accept the lower court's decision. \\"This is probably going to go to the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. So you could be looking at a price of anywhere between £200m-£250m for this to end.\\" Summary:","completion":"The legal dispute between Russian oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich has been deemed one of the most expensive cases in legal history, reaching an estimated cost of £150 million. The crux of the case was a longstanding disagreement over Abramovich's oil and aluminium companies' shares, which Berezovsky claimed he owned a significant stake in but was forced to sell at a reduced price due to threats from Abramovich. The trial has exposed possibly shady business practices and highlights the questionable state of post-Soviet Russia's business environment. The case is expected to continue in the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, potentially costing between £200 million and £250 million."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Rebecca was anxious of getting mold and mildew in the seats.; B). Mary was anxious of getting mold and mildew in the seats.;","completion":"While Rebecca left the sunroof open in the car, Mary preferred to close it every time. The primary motivations that underscored these divergent behaviors stemmed from contrasting concerns between the two individuals. In the case of option A, Rebecca was anxious about the potential buildup of mold and mildew in the seats, which is a valid concern. By leaving the sunroof open, she hoped to allow for better ventilation and reduce humidity within the car's interior. The continuous circulation of fresh air could help evaporate residual moisture, preventing the damp conditions that would typically give rise to mold and mildew. There is a possibility that Rebecca may have had previous experiences with mold, mildew, or unpleasant smells in her car due to inadequate ventilation. Such experiences might have prompted her to change her behavior and prioritize the constant exchange of air. Moreover, Rebecca's choice to leave the sunroof open could also be influenced by her personal preferences for a more open and refreshing car environment, promoting a sense of freedom and relaxation while driving. On the other hand, option B suggests that Mary was anxious about the possibility of mold and mildew growth in her car's seats. In contrast to Rebecca, however, Mary believed that by keeping the sunroof closed, she would mitigate this issue. One probable rationale behind this approach is that Mary may have been worried about rainwater or other external elements entering the car through the open sunroof, seeping into the upholstery, and fostering the growth of mold and mildew on the seats. Mary's preference for a closed sunroof might also be driven by her concerns for security, as leaving the sunroof open could expose her vehicle to potential theft or intrusion. Additionally, a closed sunroof might provide better insulation and energy efficiency for Mary's car, especially during extreme weather conditions. Closing the sunroof would prevent temperature variations that might compromise her vehicle's climate control system and her comfort as she drives. Ultimately, both Rebecca and Mary were attempting to prevent the growth of mold and mildew in their car seats, albeit through different methods that stemmed from their divergent perspectives. While Rebecca believed that allowing for better ventilation by leaving the sunroof open would achieve this goal, Mary was convinced that the best approach involved closing the sunroof to prevent the intrusion of external elements. Such contrasting behaviors highlight the subjective nature of individual experiences, habits, and beliefs, which often dictate how people respond to and manage similar concerns in their daily lives."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

New York (CNN) -- The United States and China could play a crucial role in helping finally to resolve the conflict that plagues the Korean Peninsula, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. In one of the most violent incidents in decades, North Korea shelled a South Korean island Tuesday, killing four people. North Korea accused the South of provoking the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island by holding a military exercise in the Yellow Sea. And South Korea responded by charging that the North's actions were a \\"definite military provocation.\\" In an interview with CNN, Zakaria said a long-term solution to the Korean conflict would require high-level secret talks aimed at assuring the government of China that if the two Koreas were reunified, it would not be faced with a nuclear-armed U.S. ally on its border.

Options: - bookstore - library - doctor - home - table The answer is \\"table\\" because","completion":"\\"table\\" is the most convenient and common place for people to keep and access them. While magazines can be found in various locations like bookstores, libraries, and doctors' offices, people often prefer having them readily available within their personal space. Firstly, it is important to consider the context and purpose of a magazine. Magazines usually contain articles, photographs, and other content related to specific subjects or industries. They are typically published periodically and are used as a source of information, entertainment, or inspiration for readers. The convenient size and format of magazines make it easy for individuals to place them on a table and flip through the pages, thus making them a popular choice to keep in areas where people spend most of their time. Now, let us dive deeper into the various options provided: - Bookstore: Although bookstores typically stock up on magazines, they don't represent the most common place people keep their magazines. Bookstores are primarily seen as places to purchase them, but not necessarily places to keep and constantly access them. - Library: Libraries also store various magazines that cater to a wide range of interests. However, people usually don't keep their personal magazines at the library, and library visits may be limited depending on the reader's schedule. - Doctor: Magazines could be found in the waiting rooms of doctors' offices. While this setting makes it convenient for patients to pass the time by reading magazines, they are not utilized as a personal storage space for an individual's magazine collection. - Home: Magazines are often found in homes, as this allows people to enjoy their favorite reads at their leisure. However, keeping magazines at home does not necessarily pinpoint a specific location, such as on the table. - Table: Tables, on the other hand, serve as a convenient and accessible platform for keeping magazines. A table can be found in various settings, including living rooms, offices, and waiting areas, offering an easy and natural place to store and access magazines for readers. People frequently place their magazines on coffee tables, end tables, or kitchen tables to make them readily available. The table provides a flat surface that makes it comfortable for individuals to peruse their magazines while sitting, relaxing, or multitasking. In conclusion, although magazines can be found in various locations such as bookstores, libraries, and doctors' waiting rooms, the table is the most common place for people to keep them. This is because tables offer easy access, convenience, and a universally suitable surface for reading and storing magazines in different settings, whether at home, in the office, or in public areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of boiling an egg, I would follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Gather necessary materials: - A medium to large pot with a lid - A stovetop or heating element - Fresh eggs (the desired number) - A slotted spoon or tongs - A bowl filled with cold water and ice - A timer 2. Fill the pot with enough water to cover the eggs by about 1-2 inches. This ensures that the eggs will be fully submerged and cook evenly. 3. Place the pot on the stovetop or heating element and set the heat to high. This will bring the water to a boil. 4. While the water is heating, carefully place the eggs into the pot using a slotted spoon or tongs. This prevents cracking and ensures that the eggs will be fully submerged in the water. 5. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to medium-low. This maintains a gentle boil and cooks the eggs evenly without overcooking them. 6. Set a timer for the desired level of doneness: - Soft-boiled: 4-5 minutes for a runny yolk - Medium-boiled: 6-7 minutes for a slightly set yolk - Hard-boiled: 9-12 minutes for a fully set yolk Considering each person's preference, setting a timer ensures that the eggs will be cooked to the perfect level of doneness. 7. Once the timer goes off, use the slotted spoon or tongs to carefully remove the eggs from the boiling water and immediately place them in the bowl filled with cold water and ice. This step stops the cooking process and prevents overcooking, resulting in easy peeling and perfectly cooked eggs. 8. Let the eggs sit in the ice water bath for a few minutes to cool down and settle. 9. Once the eggs have cooled, gently tap them on a hard surface to crack the shells and carefully peel them. The eggs are now ready to be enjoyed! By following these steps, I would be able to accomplish the goal of boiling an egg to the desired level of doneness, ensuring a successful and tasty result."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The mother is an integral participant in the activity described and is crucial for creating the family context of the scene. 2. \\"Daughter\\": This word is equally significant for the same reasons. It identifies the second main character and sets up a familial relationship with the first character. This also suggests a generational interaction given the inherent meaning of the word. 3. \\"Walk\\": This word signifies the main action or activity being undertaken by the subjects (mother and daughter) of the sentence. It also relates to the movement, the health, the leisure activity, and implies a peaceful, relaxed situation. 4. \\"Garden\\": This word sets the location or setting for the action. It provides crucial information on the environment and the context in which the activity is happening. The concept of a 'garden' builds a vivid image of nature, outdoors, possibly beauty and tranquillity, which adds to the tone and mood of the sentence.

He served as commanding officer of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, 1st Infantry Division. He was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his achievements in this command during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Francis Cutler Marshall has killed thousands.","completion":"While it is true that Francis Cutler Marshall was a Brigadier General in the United States Army during World War I and served as the commanding officer of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, it is important to clarify the implications made in the next sentence, \\"Francis Cutler Marshall has killed thousands.\\" As a commanding officer, Brigadier General Marshall directed and supervised the activities of thousands of men and resources, taking overall strategic decisions to ensure the success of military operations. These decisions would inevitably lead to casualties on both sides, but the sentence suggests a direct and personal responsibility on the part of Marshall for these deaths, which is not accurate. It is more appropriate to say that Brigadier General Marshall, in his position as a commanding officer, played an essential role in organizing, directing, and implementing the tactical efforts of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, 1st Infantry Division. These efforts, while resulting in casualties, were part of a larger strategy to win the war and achieve victory for the United States and its allies. The Meuse-Argonne Offensive, for which he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, was an important part of the final push to victory for the Allied forces. The operation, involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers from multiple countries, was crucial in breaking through German defenses and ultimately leading to the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne on November 11, 1918. War, as a destructive and complex event, often entails tragic consequences, and the total number of casualties during WWI was significant. However, assigning direct blame or responsibility for these casualties to a specific individual would be a gross oversimplification. In summary, though the sentence \\"Francis Cutler Marshall has killed thousands\\" follows the information about Brigadier General Marshall's command during World War I, it does not accurately represent the context and complexity of his role in the war. Instead, consider a more nuanced statement highlighting his responsibility for the strategic direction and decision-making as a commanding officer in the context of a larger military effort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The colonies that had confederated to form the United States invaded Canada (at the time a term referring specifically to the modern-day provinces of Quebec and Ontario, which had only been in British hands since 1763) at least twice, neither time succeeding in taking control of the territory. The first invasion was during the Revolution, under the assumption that French-speaking Canadians' presumed hostility towards British colonial rule combined with the Franco-American alliance would make them natural allies to the American cause; the Continental Army successfully recruited two Canadian regiments for the invasion. That invasion's failure forced the members of those regiments into exile, and they settled mostly in upstate New York. The Articles of Confederation, written during the Revolution, included a provision for Canada to join the United States, should they ever decide to do so, without needing to seek U.S. permission as other states would. The United States again invaded Canada during the War of 1812, but this effort was made more difficult due to the large number of Loyalist Americans that had fled to what is now Ontario and still resisted joining the republic. The Hunter Patriots in the 1830s and the Fenian raids after the American Civil War were private attacks on Canada from the U.S. Several U.S. politicians in the 19th century also spoke in favour of annexing Canada.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I’m here in Dubrovnik, Croatia for a team meetup. Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort. Although I’m one of the few people in the developed world who does not watch Game of Thrones, my co-workers tell me this was one of the locations used for a scene in the show.

The film is about the marriage of a gynecologist named David and his wife Marianne . The film 's score was composed by Dag Wirén . - Ernst Ingmar Bergman (14 July 1918 30 July 2007) was a Swedish director, writer, and producer who worked in film, television, theatre and radio. He is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential auteurs of all time, and is most famous for films such as \\"The Seventh Seal\\" (1957), \\"Wild Strawberries\\" (1957), \\"Persona\\" (1966), \\"Cries and Whispers\\" (1972) and \\"Fanny and Alexander\\" (1982). - The Seventh Seal is a 1957 Swedish drama-fantasy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play \\"Wood Painting\\". The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \\"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\\". Here the motif of silence refers to the \\"silence of God,\\" which is a major theme of the film. - Fanny and Alexander is a Swedish drama film which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 17 December 1982, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in Uppsala, Sweden in the 1900s. It was originally conceived as a four-part TV movie and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188-minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The TV version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312-minute cut, at five hours and 12 minutes, is one of the longest cinematic films in history. - Cries and Whispers (lit. \\"Whispers and Cries\\") is a 1972 Swedish film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann.

Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Grass-roots fury rippled across Lebanon on Tuesday as a Hezbollah-backed politician got the nod to be the fractious country's new prime minister. Lebanon's president, Michel Suleiman, appointed Najib Mikati to lead the country's government, a step seen by supporters of caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Western-backed Future Movement as a power grab by the Iranian-backed Shiite movement. Mikati spoke shortly after his appointment, telling CNN that he is not Hezbollah's man and asking for time to prove himself in the new post. He suggested that one year would be a reasonable period in which to judge his leadership. CNN reporters in Beirut dodged rocks as 50 to 100 supporters of","completion":"Hariri's Future Movement took to the streets in protest of Mikati's appointment. The protesters expressed their frustration and anger at what they perceive as a hostile takeover by Hezbollah and its allies, threatening Lebanon's already fragile political stability. The protests soon spread to other parts of the country, with tensions escalating to burning tires, vandalizing public properties, and clashes with security forces. Lebanese authorities were quick to respond, deploying military and police units to maintain order and restore calm in the affected areas. As the situation unfolded, international reactions varied. The United States expressed concern over the developments in Lebanon, calling on all parties to respect democratic principles and work towards political stability. European leaders urged Lebanon's new government to maintain its commitment to the United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which is investigating the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Saad Hariri's father. This investigation has further polarized Lebanon's political landscape, as several Hezbollah members have been implicated in the assassination. Mikati, a billionaire businessman with political experience, has faced skepticism in his new role as prime minister. Critics argue that his appointment, backed by Hezbollah and its allies, is a clear indication of the group's growing influence over Lebanon's political affairs and a shift away from a pro-Western stance that his predecessor, Saad Hariri, had maintained. On the other hand, Mikati's supporters maintain that he is a moderate leader who seeks to unite Lebanon and act in the country's best interests. In a bid to address the concerns of the protesting citizens and international observers, Mikati promised to work for the benefit of Lebanon and strive to maintain its sovereignty. He stressed that his government would focus on socioeconomic and security issues, reassuring them that he would uphold democratic principles and prevent foreign interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. Despite these assurances, it remains to be seen how the new government will navigate the many challenges facing Lebanon. Political divisions run deep in the country, with various factions still heavily armed and maintaining influence over different areas, much to the detriment of the central government. The country's economic crisis has also intensified, with rampant inflation, high unemployment rate, and a worsening public debt situation. To make matters worse, Lebanon's fragile political landscape is further complicated by sectarian tensions and a history of foreign intervention, most notably by Syria and Iran. As Mikati forms his government and begins to address these myriad challenges, both the Lebanese people and the international community will be watching closely to see if he can successfully strike a balance between the competing interests and maintain stability in this volatile region. Over the upcoming year, Lebanon's citizens will have the chance to judge Mikati's leadership and decide if he can indeed overcome the power struggles and deliver on his promises of a brighter future for the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have -2525*f + 2149*f = 11656. First, we need to combine the f terms. Imagine that you have -2525 apples and then you get 2149 apples. To find out how many apples you have now (-2525 + 2149) you just add the numbers together: -2525 + 2149 = -376 So now our equation looks like this: -376*f = 11656 To find out what f is, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -376 (imagine splitting the apples into even groups). It will look like this: f = 11656 / -376 And when you divide 11656 by -376, you get: f = -31 So the answer is f = -31.

Tyson recently took to Twitter to express his thoughts on the scientific accuracy—or inaccuracy—of the hit film \\"Gravity,\\" stating that the film would be more appropriately titled \\"Angular Momentum.\\" However, despite his qualms, Tyson did say he enjoyed the movie \\"very much.\\" Among the various issues Tyson shared on Twitter, as reported by the Atlantic Wire, were the following: 1. \\"Nearly all satellites orbit Earth west to east, yet all satellite debris portrayed orbited east to west.\\" 2. \\"Satellite communications were disrupted at 230 mi up, but communications satellites orbit 100x higher.\\" 3. \\"Why Bullock's hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.\\" 4. \\"How Hubble (350mi up) ISS (230mi up) & a Chinese Space Station are all in sight lines of one another.\\" 5. \\"Why Bullock, a medical Doctor, is servicing the Hubble Space Telescope.\\" 6. \\"Why we enjoy a SciFi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space.\\" Tyson isn't the only one scrutinizing the film's accuracy; a New York Times reviewer took an actual astronaut to see the film—an engineer who had repaired the Hubble Space Telescope himself—and the astronaut pointed out a plot hole \\"big enough to drive the Starship Enterprise through.\\" The issue in question was the astronauts using a jetpack to travel from the Hubble to the International Space Station, a journey that is so far that even a space shuttle wouldn't be able to make the trip.

Despite the film's scientific inaccuracies, \\"Gravity\\" has gained immense praise and attention, demonstrating that many viewers are willing to overlook these inaccuracies for the sake of enjoying an entertaining sci-fi film. There remains an ongoing debate, however, about whether or not filmmakers should take greater care to achieve scientific accuracy when producing movies set in space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days. Question: \\"How do you calculate the height of a wave?\\" Answer: \\"Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, actually calculating the height of a wave involves measuring the distance from the crest, which is the very top of the wave, down to the trough, which is the very bottom of the wave. So, it's more than just saying amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size.

The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970, by songwriters/multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood with drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of Beatlesque pop, classical arrangements, and futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's leader, arranging and producing every album while writing virtually all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan and keyboardist Richard Tandy were the group's only consistent members. For the next six years, Harvest and Epic/Legacy reissued ELO's back catalogue. Included amongst the remastered album tracks were unreleased songs and outtakes, including two new singles. The first was \\"Surrender\\" which registered on the lower end of the UK Singles Chart at number 81, some 30 years after it was written in 1976. The other single was \\"Latitude 88 North\\". On 9 August 2010, Eagle Rock Entertainment released Live - The Early Years in the UK as a DVD compilation that included Fusion - Live in London (1976) along with never before released live performances at Brunel University (1973) and on a German TV show Rockpalast (1974). The US had a slightly edited release on 24 August 2010. The Essential Electric Light Orchestra artwork was re-jigged to feature two different covers. The US and Australian releases shared one design, while the rest of the world featured the other for a new double album release in October 2011. Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra was released on 8 October 2012. It is an album of new recordings of ELO's greatest hits by Lynne; along with a new song \\"Point of No Return\\", released to coincide with Lynne's second solo album release Long Wave. These new 2012 albums contained advertisement cards, announcing the re-release of expanded and remastered versions of both the 2001 album Zoom and Lynne's debut solo album Armchair Theatre, originally released in 1990. Both albums were re-released in April 2013 with various bonus tracks. Also released was the live album, Electric Light Orchestra Live, showcasing songs from the Zoom tour. All three releases also featured new studio recordings as bonus tracks. Lynne and Tandy reunited again on 12 November 2013 to perform, under the name Jeff Lynne and Friends, \\"Livin' Thing\\" and \\"Mr Blue Sky\\" at the Children in Need Rocks concert at Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, London. The backing orchestra was the BBC Concert Orchestra, with Chereene Allen on lead violin. Entity:","completion":"The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\"?

First of all, I have to start this comment by saying I'm a huge Nightmare on Elm Street fan. I think it's the greatest horror series ever. For me, Freddy is the boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's Dead, which tried to be the last chapter back then, is a weird movie. It doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films. Freddy has a lot of screen time. Some think it makes him less scary, which I do agree. And that's, in my opinion, exactly the point. This movie exists so we can know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he were, how he became the man haunting our dreams. For some people, it's a bad thing, it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil. Obviously those people won't like Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. To truly enjoy this one, you have to see things differently. It's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you. This was the first one, and it was awesome. As the years passed by, Freddy killed more and more people, and nobody could ever get rid of him for good. Now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's realm of terror. Beside the story of Freddy's past, I also really liked the atmosphere of the movie. No more kids in Springwood, only crazy grown-ups. The nightmare scenes are all great. The soundtrack is awesome, especially the opening song called ''I'm Awake Now'' performed by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can't believe it's so underrated. Maybe it is misunderstood, or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too, and a lot of cameos! Get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed.

Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: This book takes the struggle out of working with BPD Review: This book is designed for use in skill training groups for BPD. The author offers advice on adapting it to be used in individual therapy however. Linehan is forging a place in the mental health field as the foremost clinican in dealing with BPD. The reader is immediately aware of the extensive amount of research that went into this book. The author is not writing about opinion, she is writing about the results of years of extensively scrutinzing the work of herself and others. On the downside the book has the amount and quality of information one would expect from a textbook. This is not light reading, it is however a page turner (as far as academic texts go) if you have ever felt inadequate when dealing with BPD. After applying the ideas in this book I found that BPD was not the same beast in treating than in the past. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is primarily positive. The reviewer appreciates the extensive research that went into the book and recognizes the author's expertise in the mental health field related to BPD.

Without specifically being asked by police to identify the suspect, a neighbor pointed out Perry from a nearby window as the alleged thief. Now, the Supreme Court has found that initial identification was not overly suggestive and did not violate the due process rights of the defendant. The 8-1 ruling Wednesday is a victory for the state and for law enforcement. But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned police and prosecutors in general to be careful about the trustworthiness of eyewitness testimony, when such evidence may be generated and manipulated by police. She said, however, that was not the case here. \\"We do not doubt the either the fallibility or the importance of eyewitness evidence generally, or the caution appropriate whenever suggestive circumstances may have influenced an identification,\\" she wrote for the majority. \\"Safeguards built into our adversary system [of justice] can serve to inhibit juries from placing undue weight on eyewitness and other testimony of questionable reliability... Absent improper police conduct, these safeguards, we hold, keep the introduction of eyewitness identification evidence within constitutional bounds.\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the lone dissenter. The court's narrow ruling was not likely to open the legal floodgates to a range of new exceptions of evidence jurors would be excluded from hearing at trial, as some states had feared. The Perry appeal also raised larger questions about the unique power of eyewitness identifications to sway jurors, and whether innocent people are unfairly being sent to prison, particularly to death row. The court has not taken a hard look at the issue since 1977, and the opinion Wednesday only dealt indirectly with the concerns. The unique facts of the Perry case in fact, left a clear rule on the boundaries of using unreliable identification evidence even more elusive and muddled, despite the high court's current intervention. The message from the high court: A broader rule on the use of all eyewitness testimony is now not necessary, and that judges and juries can make those discretionary decisions, depending on each individual case. Several justices noted during November's oral arguments Perry's lawyers presented strong evidence, and that reforms may be necessary. But others on the bench wondered whether such changes are mandated under the Constitution, and if they would apply in other areas of criminal justice where evidence is problematic. The incident happened in August 2008 in Nashua, New Hampshire. A black male was reported at the back of an apartment parking lot in the middle of the night. A city police officer arrived and found Perry carrying two amplifiers, which he claimed he found on the ground. An apartment resident then approached police and said his car was broken into, information relayed by his neighbor. While Perry was detained in the parking lot, that officer went to the apartment to interview the neighbor. When asked to describe the suspect, she said it was a \\"tall black man,\\" but offered no other physical details. When asked by the officer for more information, the neighbor looked back and said \\"it was the man that was in the back parking lot standing with the police officer,\\" according to court records. Later at the police station, the female neighbor was unable to identify Perry from a photo lineup. Perry was then arrested, subsequently convicted of theft, and given a three- to 10-year prison term. He appealed, saying the eyewitness testimony should have been suppressed. Subsequent state courts rejected his claims that due process protections apply even when the suggestive circumstances were not \\"intentionally orchestrated by the police.\\"Eyewitness identification has been closely scrutinized by a range of legal groups and social scientists -- some 2,000 empirical studies, in fact, over the past three decades, according to one legal brief filed with the high court. It has also become a staple of crime dramas: a witness rises from the stand, points to the defendant and says \\"That's the man who did it, I'm sure, your Honor.\\" But not always. A variety of all-too-human factors can distort, manipulate, or mislead a person's memory, whether spurred by police involvement or not. A new book by law professor Brandon Garrett called \\"Convicting the Innocent\\" found the initial 250 DNA exonerations around the United States came about after 190 of the prisoners were convicted based on mistaken eyewitnesses. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution mandates the government not \\"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\\" That has led to a long line of jurisprudence over what areas of the criminal justice system are covered by the broad provision. The conservative high court majority two years ago said inmates could not go to court to demand, under due process, DNA testing to establish their innocence. \\"We are reluctant to enlist the federal judiciary in creating new constitutional code of rules for handling DNA,\\" said Chief Justice John Roberts at the time, suggesting that was best left to legislatures. The eyewitness case is Perry v. New Hampshire (10-8974). Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Barion Perry was caught and handcuffed at a crime scene, suspected of breaking into cars. A neighbor saw him and said he was the thief. The Supreme Court said that the neighbor's identification was okay to use in court and didn't break any rules. This was a win for the state and the police. The Court decided that it's okay for eyewitnesses or neighbors to identify suspects, as long as the police don't force them to say something that's not true. In the end, Perry was found guilty and given a prison sentence. This case brought up some concerns about whether eyewitness versions should always be allowed in court, but the Court thinks it's enough to let judges and juries decide each case individually."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Grande dame of cooking still going strong at 90: Julia Child celebrates in San Francisco. How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex. Question: \\"How old is Julia Child?\\" Answer: \\"90\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Question: Information: - Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word \\"techno\\" in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Tech house is a subgenre of house music that mixes elements of techno with house. The term \\"tech house\\" developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, such as \\"rugged basslines\\" and \\"steely beats,\\" with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house. The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK. In the mid to late 1990s a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by Mr.C & Plink Plonk, Heart & Soul, and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles. Other DJs and artists associated with the sound at that time included Charles Webster, Bushwacka!, Cuartero, Dave Angel, Herbert, Funk D'Void, Ian O'Brien, Derrick Carter, and Stacey Pullen. By the late 90's London nightclub The End, owned by the former Shamen rapper Richard West (Mr C) and Layo Paskin, was considered the home of tech house in the UK. Tech house tracks are typically between 610 minutes in length. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Trance is a genre of electronic music that developed during the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 \\"peaks\\" or \\"drops.\\" Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient, and film music. - Matthias Paul, better known by his stage name Paul van Dyk (born 16 December 1971 in Eisenhüttenstadt, East Germany) is a German Grammy Award-winning DJ, record producer and musician. One of the first true superstar DJs, Paul van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release \\"Reflections\\". He was named the World's number one DJ in both 2005 and 2006, something only few DJs have ever achieved. He was the first ever DJ to be named number one by \\"Mixmag\\" in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide. - The Politics of Dancing 2 is an album of trance music mixed by Paul van Dyk as a sequel to his The Politics of Dancing . - Mixmag is a British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, published in London, England. Launched in 1982, the magazine covers dance events, and reviews music and club nights. - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. - Eisenhüttenstadt (literally \\"ironworks city\\" in German) is a town in the Oder-Spree district of the state of Brandenburg, Germany, on the border with Poland. It had a population of 32,214 as of 31 December 2008. What is the relationship between 'the politics of dancing 2' and '2005'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'The Politics of Dancing 2' and '2005' is that The Politics of Dancing 2 is an album of trance music mixed by Paul van Dyk, and it was released in 2005.

Because Rachel was a rebel and Kayla was well behaved,","completion":"they complemented each other perfectly as best friends. It always seemed like they were two halves of the same coin, and their strong bond made them inseparable. Rachel was known to take risks and push boundaries, both at school and within the small town they lived in. She was always the one to suggest a new adventure, whether it be exploring the abandoned house at the end of their street, or attempting to skateboard down a steep hill or instigating water balloon wars with the neighboring kids. Kayla, on the other hand, was the voice of reason in their tandem. Though she was generally considered more cautious and orderly, she was no less daring. She was always there to lend a hand to Rachel when needed and provide a backup plan when Rachel's impulsive ideas would inevitably go awry. Kayla's constant presence simultaneously kept Rachel grounded and made her feel invincible. One fateful day, an unexpected event would test their bond and force them to rely on their respective strengths more than ever. It began like any other lazy summer day in their small town, with the sun shining brightly, and the tranquil sound of birdsong filling the air. Rachel had an idea to explore the dense forest that bordered their town, a place rumored to be filled with adventure and mystery. At first, Kayla was hesitant. The forest was known to be the territory of a craggy, reclusive old man named Mr. Thorne, who was often the subject of whispered rumors involving dark and unusual happenings. However, Rachel's unwavering excitement and their thirst for a new experience eventually swayed her, and the two set off on their journey. Entering the forest, Rachel took the lead, charging headlong into the dense foliage, while Kayla eagerly followed, her trust in her best friend outweighing any lingering doubts. Hours went by as they delved deeper, the forest’s beauty captivating the two girls as they marveled at their surroundings. They discovered a crystal-clear creek with water flowing gently over smooth rocks, and scaled ancient trees with thick branches strong enough to support their weight. As the day wore on and the shadows grew longer, a subtle uneasiness began to take root in both Rachel and Kayla. Unspoken between them, each hoped the other would suggest turning back; but neither wanted to be the first to admit defeat - until they reached a clearing that seemingly appeared out of nowhere. In the center of the clearing stood the decaying frame of Mr. Thorne's decaying cabin, its dark windows peering ominously at the intruders. Rachel's curiosity was piqued, but for the first time that day, she hesitated. The troubled look in Kayla's eyes convinced her to trust her best friend's instincts, and the two decided that, perhaps, it was best to retreat. But as the girls turned to leave, they heard a faint whispering sound, drifting through the forest on the cool evening breeze. Intrigued and unable to resist, they followed the sound until they stumbled upon an aged, knotted tree with an ancient-looking tome wedged within its roots. The discovery of the book seemed to electrify the air. Rachel reached out tentatively to grasp the worn leather cover, but as her fingers brushed against it, the entire forest seemed to transform. Colors shifted and shimmered, as if the world had turned itself inside out, and the girls found themselves standing not in the forest, but within the mysterious pages of the tome. For the first time, Rachel was at a loss for what to do. In this strange realm, her rebellious nature felt overwhelmed. Kayla, sensing the vulnerability in her best friend, stepped up and took the lead. They explored this new world together, encountering bizarre creatures and landscapes unlike anything they had ever seen. With each new challenge, Kayla's confidence grew stronger. She discovered an innate talent for unraveling the secrets of magical runes, which she used to guide them through traps and obstacles. Meanwhile, Rachel's bravery and enduring sense of adventure kept them pushing forward, never faltering or giving in to despair. As the girls ventured deeper into the universe within the tome, they learned of a prophecy that foretold the arrival of two strangers, destined to defeat a malevolent force that threatened the harmony of the realm. The people of this world, inspired by their courage and unwavering friendship, joined Kayla and Rachel on their journey. Together, the girls harnessed their unique strengths and, against all odds, defeated the dark force, restoring peace and balance. As the grateful citizens expressed their admiration and farewells, Rachel and Kayla discovered the path that would allow them to return to their own reality - and, perhaps, take a little bit of magic with them. Having faced unimaginable challenges and emerging stronger than ever, Rachel and Kayla returned to their small town as heroes of a realm unknown to anyone around them. Their bond, already strong, was now unbreakable. Each carried with them the other's essence, Rachel's impulsiveness tempered by Kayla's wisdom and Kayla's persistence fueled by Rachel's daring spirit. No one in their town ever discovered the secret of the two girls' adventures, and though they never spoke of it, the shared experience was a constant reminder of how their friendship balanced and united them in a way that transcended even the most extraordinary of experiences. And so, the rebel and the well-behaved girl became inseparable forces, proving time and time again that no challenge was too great as long as they faced it together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Option B, \\"talk to each other,\\" also seems plausible. Members of a religious group, like any other group, do communicate with one another.

Answer the above question based on the context below: On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes). More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.

Summarize the following: Notice the objects, shapes and lines in the background when taking pictures and when editing your pictures. Avoid including any distractions above the person's head. Steer clear of things like tree trunks, posts, narrow buildings, vertical lines, etc. At the same time, aim to have an interesting background. Read up on landscape art composition; this will help you to appreciate the art of composing more. There are many good books and websites available on the topic of landscape art composition. In the photo shown here, the photographer has carefully composed everything: The poser in the foreground is what you notice first. We then notice the other people in the photo. The path also guides on along the visual path. In the background, a distance away, you finally see a nice landscape with the high building. If you have two centers of interest, you must compose your photo carefully. For example, in this image, you can see that the boat blends in with the building in the background––the photo could have been composed better. Selective focus with the background remaining blurry is an option where there is more than one center of interest. A different camera angle horizontal or vertical could help too; take many photos and choose from the best among them. Anything involving a scene, such as a beach scene, can be all too easy to clutter, especially if you're a novice at composition. This scene has a lot of potential. The beach is obviously the center of interest but the white building in the upper left corner and the other building draws attention away from the beach. Crop this type of distraction by including just a portion of the white building. Notice the simplicity of professional photos and frames of scenes in well made movies, and imitate this simplicity in your photos. Learn from the graphic design of products like beer ads. When composing your photo, think how a professional photographer would take the picture, and take your photo like a professional photographer. Move a bit, move a lot and use the different setting in your camera to arrange the elements in your photo. Summary:","completion":"When taking pictures, look at the background and try to make it interesting without distractions. Be careful about things like trees, buildings, and lines.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The wind or water deposits tiny rocks - The rocks become known as sediment - The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top - Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve - Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process leading to the formation of sedimentary rocks is the weathering and erosion of pre-existing rocks. To provide a clear understanding of the entire process, here's the complete sequence: 1. Weathering and erosion: The process begins with weathering, where rocks are broken down into smaller pieces through the action of wind, water, temperature changes, and other natural processes. Erosion then transports these rock fragments and particles away from their original location to new areas. 2. Deposition: The wind or water deposits the tiny rocks, also referred to as sediments, in a new location, such as riverbanks, deltas, or the bottom of lakes and oceans. 3. Accumulation: The sediments become progressively buried under more material being deposited, forming layers, also known as beds or strata. 4. Compaction: Over time, the weight of overlying layers pressing down on the sediment causes compaction, pushing particles closer together and expelling water between them, which in turn reduces the overall volume of the sediment layers. 5. Cementation: Minerals from the surrounding rocks dissolve in water that is present in the sediment, and these dissolved minerals act as a cement or glue, binding the sediment particles together. This precipitated mineral cement fills the spaces between the particles, effectively solidifying the sediment into a single rock known as a sedimentary rock. Some examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, limestone, and shale. These rocks often have distinctive layering or bedding and may contain fossils, which provide important information about the environment and history of Earth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A man who is accused of stealing an ambulance from a hospital in Michigan told police when he was arrested that he took the vehicle so he could drive to a strip club. Bryan Kryscio was arrested on Sunday after he was found behind the wheel of the emergency vehicle when police pulled him over. But when they asked him why he took the ambulance he told them he was on his way to a pole dancing club. Earlier in the evening, officers had been called to McLaren Oakland Hospital in Pontiac, after reports that an ambulance was taken after it was left outside unlocked with the engine running. According to foxdc.com, emergency workers were returning a stretcher to the ambulance when they saw it being driven off. One of the ambulance workers had left their cell phone inside and officers were able to use it to trace the vehicle to Sterling Heights, 14 miles away. Krysico, who is homeless and said to have mental health issues, was then found behind the wheel and immediately arrested. When officers then asked him why he took the ambulance, he told them he was on his way to the 'Booby Trap', a topless bar in Detroit to see pole dancing, even though the club has been closed for years. Police confirmed that even though the ambulance had been taken there wasn't any damage and it was returned to the emergency services. Undersheriff Mike McCabe of Oakland County Police told the Detroit Free Press: 'The caller advised that the ambulance was not locked and that a cellular phone had been left inside. 'The medication box, EMS radio and EKG monitor were all intact.' Officers had been called to McLaren Oakland Hospital in Pontiac, Michigan, pictured, earlier in the evening after staff reported the theft of an ambulance. Police also added that he has convictions for robbery in Florida, as well as breaking and entering, trespassing and possession of marijuana convictions in Michigan. Kryscio, 50, was arraigned yesterday on a charge of unlawfully driving away an automobile and is currently being held at Oakland County Jail. He is scheduled to appear at Pontiac District Court later this month. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A man named Bryan Kryscio took an ambulance from a hospital because he wanted to drive to a place where people dance on poles, called a strip club.

Here is an article: Thirty Seconds to Mars, the rock band fronted by actor Jared Leto, kicked off the onslaught of new videos released this week with \\"Do or Die,\\" an inspiring anthem featuring heartfelt, fan-filmed messages. VEVO and YouTube this week unwrapped a handful of musical treats for viewers: In addition to Thirty Seconds to Mars, Kings of Leon, Fergie and Gavin DeGraw also released new music videos. \\"Do or Die\\" (embedded above) is the second single off the group's Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams album. The clip cuts in and out of Echelon (the name of the Thirty Seconds to Mars fan base) confessionals, in what amounts to a seven-minute love letter video from band to fans and vice versa. It also includes footage from the band's quest to break a world record for most number of live shows during a single album cycle — 300. Fergie clearly doesn't want summer to end — or for us to forget about The Great Gatsby — in \\"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody.\\" Her rocking addition to the film's soundtrack got its own personal makeover (though it still very much looks like we're raging at Gatsby's, just without him). The new-money glitz persists in similar fashion, though, which should be no surprise, as the artist has always had a penchant for the glamorous. DeGraw, hat always on head, belts it and melts it in the music video for \\"Best I Ever Had,\\" which casts a bifurcated spotlight on the crooning singer (indoors) and his beautiful muse (outdoors). The song previews DeGraw's fifth studio album, slated to drop later this year. In a highly stylized and oddly filtered music video, Kings of Leon take the stage to bang out \\"Supersoaker.\\" The video shows the band retrofitted to perform in a decade not our own, with an old-fashioned-looking sailor trying to get lucky alongside snippets of vintage rides, fashion statements and other old-timey paraphernalia. The song is one of the first singles off fall's upcoming Mechanical Bull album. VEVO, YouTube and American Express are teaming up to present Kings of Leon live from London, as part of the American Express Unstaged concert series. Directed by Fred Armisen, the group will play classics and new songs from Bull, live from London's Shepherd's Bush. The show starts at 4 p.m. ET on Friday.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The story is set in Rome the early 4th century AD, during the time of the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian. The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on. Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed. Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome. After some dramatic events that reveal his surprising connections to Syra, who is his long-lost younger sister Myriam, Fulvius rejects his evil ways, converts to Christianity and becomes a hermit. Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, Syra's real name is Myriam. She is revealed to be the long-lost younger sister of Fulvius, the hunter of Christians who later converts to Christianity and becomes a hermit."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

Suffolk is well-known for its picturesque landscapes, charming towns, and rich history. Framlingham Castle itself is an impressive, medieval fortress that dates back to the 12th century. It was built by Roger Bigod, the Earl of Norfolk, and is a classic example of a Norman castle with a curtain wall, surrounded by a large moat. The fortress was constructed as both a residential and defensive structure and has witnessed numerous historical events over the years. The castle played a vital role during the War of the Roses, when it changed hands between the House of Lancaster and the House of York. Notably, Mary Tudor, the sister of Henry VIII and future Queen of England, gathered her forces at Framlingham Castle in 1553 to assert her claim to the English throne upon the death of her half-brother, Edward VI. Framlingham Castle is famous for its curtain wall, which consists of 13 massive towers that surround the castle grounds, creating a formidable and awe-inspiring structure. As you explore the castle and climb the towers, you are treated to panoramic views of the surrounding countryside and the market town of Framlingham. In modern times, Framlingham Castle is managed by English Heritage, an organization responsible for preserving and promoting England's historic sites. Today, visitors can learn about the rich history of the castle through interactive exhibitions, take guided tours, or participate in educational events and workshops. The grounds of the castle regularly host various events, ranging from historical re-enactments to open-air theater performances.

Summarize: The Humane Society of the United States has noted that most cages available on the market for guinea pigs are simply too small. In fact, most cages are instead meant to house smaller animals like hamsters and gerbils. Unlike other animals, guineas pigs need floor space, not vertical space. They need ample room to move around and exercise in order to stay healthy. A cage that is too small for a guinea pig can cause the animal to become bored and depressed. Imagine if you had to spend your entire life living in a closet with little room for activity and stimulation. Guinea pig cages that are too small have also been linked to the development of certain medical conditions. They are more likely to get pododermatitis (the equivalent of bed sores, but on their hocks) as a result of sitting still on soiled bedding. Larger cages are also better if you have more than one guinea pig so that each pet can have its own personal space. Larger cages also have benefits for you as well! They're easier to clean because they enable guinea pigs to separate their \\"bathroom\\" space from their other living areas. Typically, the recommended standard cage size is about 2 square feet per guinea pig. However, this is insufficient, as there is not enough room for everything a guinea pig needs, including food, water dish, nest, and bathroom area. Guinea Pigs need more room than other animals, because they cannot use the running wheels. Instead, they need space to exercise. Consider the following guidelines, which provide more space and consider the number of pigs in the cage: 1 guinea pig - 7.5 square feet (0.75m2) minimum size. More is advised. Aim for a cage that is 30\\" x 36\\" (75cm x 100cm) 2 guinea pigs - 7.5 square feet (0.75m2) cage (minimum). However, 10.5 square feet (1m2) is advised. Aim for a cage that is 30\\" x 60” (75cm x 150cm). 3 guinea pigs - 10.5 square feet (1m2) cage (minimum). However, 13 square feet (1.25m2) feet is advised. Look for a cage that is 30\\" x 76” (75cm x 190cm). 4 guinea pigs - 13 square feet (1.25m2) cage (minimum). However, more space is advisable and you should look for a cage about 30\\" x 90” (75cm x 225cm). Where you place the cage in your home is very important. For sanitary reasons, avoid keeping the cage in or very near to the kitchen. You'll need to consider several factors in order to determine the right spot, including: Temperature - Make sure to keep your guinea pig cage away from extreme temperatures because the animals don't like very cold, warm and humid temperatures and can become ill. The ideal temperature for a guinea pig cage is about 65-75℉ (18-24℃). Keep the cage away from drafty spaces like doors and windows and place it on an elevated surface. Activity - Guinea pigs enjoy being near family activity and benefit from more attention when they’re easy to see and hear. A family room or living room works well, but make sure your pigs have a place to retreat if they need some quiet time. Noise - Guinea pigs have very sensitive hearing and their cages should not be placed next to stereos, televisions or other loud noises. Put the cage in an area in your home where you can supervise interactions between your children and the guinea pig so that your guinea pig does not escape or get injured. Similarly, keep your pig safe from any pets (especially cats and dogs) by keeping the cage inaccessible to curious pets. Some people choose to keep guinea pigs indoors, where they are safe from extreme weather and predatory animals, while others prefer to keep them in outdoor hutches. If you choose to keep your guinea pig indoors, attempt to get your pet out into the sunshine regularly to aid Vitamin D synthesis for healthy bones and teeth. If you have an outdoor hutch, the guinea pig requires daily attention from the owner. Bring your pet inside in extremes of weather. In addition, guinea pigs are social animals and thrive when they are able to interact with humans. Keeping them outdoors limits opportunities for daily socialization.","completion":"The Humane Society states that most guinea pig cages on the market are too small, as they are designed for smaller animals like hamsters.

She is caught by the other girls, and forced to explain that the man offered her Â£20,000 for the ring. Annabelle, the new head girl of St. Trinian's, bartered for Â£100,000 from the man when he called back, but he refused and then proceeded to threaten them. Afterwards, the girls ask the headmistress, Camilla Fritton, about why the ring might be so valuable. She tells them a story about Pirate Fritton, her ancestor, who supposedly hid a great treasure somewhere in the world. He had two rings made, which when fitted together would reveal the location of the treasure. The man on the telephone who wanted the ring is Sir Piers Pomfrey, a member of a secret society, and descendant of a man robbed by Pirate Fritton in 1589. Sir Piers manages to steal the ring from headmistress Camilla. The girls decide to search for the second ring, and find a clue left by another ancestor of the Frittons, who found the first ring (left in the library) and believed he knew where to look for the second. After a difficult deciphering of the clue, a midnight hunt in a graveyard, dealing with demonic possession, and disguising themselves as boys to infiltrate another school, the girls find the elusive second ring at last. Now, all that is left is to steal back the ring that Sir Piers Pomphrey took.

An exotic spider farmer named Joshua (Tom Noonan) has been making regular visits to the site, where he collects crickets for his spiders. Although the spiders have ingested the toxins, he is oblivious since the arachnids seem unaffected. Joshua shows Mike (Scott Terra), a local boy, his collection, which include Jumping spiders, Trapdoor spiders, Tarantulas, and orb-weavers, including a female orb-weaver named Consuela. After Mike leaves, Joshua is bitten by an escaped tarantula and accidentally knocks down the spider cages. He is killed by the spiders and, after devouring him, the spiders grow to even huger proportions.On his way home, Mike is accosted by his mother, Sheriff Samantha 'Sam' Parker (Kari Wührer) and Deputy Pete pulling the toxic barrel out of the pond. Wade, the Mayor of Prosperity, is holding a town meeting in the mall about whether they should sell the mines and relocate.

(CNN)From leading the fight against colonial rule in Africa to triumphing in major sporting events, Ghanaians have a lot to feel proud of their country. This is after all one of Africa's major economic powerhouses and a country with a rich history that is consistently held up as a successful example of democracy in the continent. Despite its relatively small size and population, Ghana boasts today one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, driven mainly by its substantial natural riches and strong agricultural production. Previously known as the Gold Coast (because of the vast quantities of the precious metal found there), Ghana gained its independence from Great Britain in 1957, becoming the first sub-Saharan nation to break the chains of colonialism. Since he the discovery of the Jubilee field off the coast of","completion":"Ghana in 2007, the country has been bolstering its position as a major player in the international oil and gas industry. The significant reserve of hydrocarbons has attracted investment from various global companies, leading to the development of a thriving oil sector that has further diversified and strengthened Ghana's economy. In addition to oil, Ghana continues to be a significant exporter of gold and cocoa, with the latter being a key driver of the country's agricultural growth. Under the guidance of its visionary leaders, Ghana has successfully transitioned from a fragile post-colonial nation to a stable and democratic country with a promising future. Throughout the years, the nation has witnessed numerous orderly and peaceful transfers of power, a testament to the strength of its democratic institutions and the political maturity of its citizens. Moreover, Ghana has maintained a commitment to human rights and press freedom, reinforcing its status as a beacon of democracy across Africa. Ghana's achievements are not only limited to the political and economic spheres, but also extend to the realm of sports and popular culture. For instance, the Ghanaian national football team, nicknamed the Black Stars, has consistently been one of Africa's top teams at both the African Cup of Nations and the FIFA World Cup, inspiring pride and unity among its supporters. Additionally, Ghana has produced a wealth of talent in the arts, with the country's vibrant film industry, known as Ghallywood, earning international recognition for distinctive storytelling and creative expression. In summary, despite its modest size and population, Ghana stands tall as an African powerhouse, boasting an impressive and diverse economy, a stable and flourishing democracy, and a rich cultural heritage. The nation's accomplishments serve as a shining example for other African countries striving to achieve similar success, and Ghanaians can rightfully take pride in the remarkable history and achievements that have set their country apart."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Problem: Solve f + 27 = 26 for f. And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation f + 27 = 26 for f, you should follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the equation The given equation is f + 27 = 26, where f is the unknown variable. Step 2: Isolate the variable f To isolate the variable f, you need to eliminate the other terms on the side of the equation containing f. In this case, there is only the term 27. Step 3: Subtract 27 from both sides of the equation Since you are trying to eliminate 27 from the left side of the equation, you can subtract it from both sides to maintain the balance of the equation. Perform the following operation: f + 27 - 27 = 26 - 27 Step 4: Simplify the equation Now, simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, the +27 and -27 terms cancel each other out, leaving just f. On the right side, subtract 27 from 26 to get -1. f = -1 Step 5: Check the solution To make sure the solution is correct, substitute the value of f back into the original equation to see if the equation holds true: (-1) + 27 = 26 26 = 26 Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution f = -1 is correct.

Buffalo omelette was bland, heavy on pungent blue cheese. Wanted to love the place but food was ok. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively? OPTIONS: a. negative; b. positive;","completion":"a. negative This review can be interpreted as negative for several reasons. Firstly, the reviewer states that the Buffalo omelette was bland which implies that the food lacked flavor or excitement. A bland dish often leads to dissatisfaction, as diners generally expect their meals to be well-seasoned and tasty. Moreover, the reviewer also mentions that the omelette was heavy on pungent blue cheese, which can mean it was overpowering and not well-balanced in terms of flavor. Additionally, the reviewer expressed their disappointment by saying that they \\"wanted to love the place.\\" This sentiment suggests that their expectations were not met, and they were left feeling let down by their dining experience. Their final comment that the food was \\"ok\\" further reinforces the negative tone of the review, as a neutral or an \\"ok\\" assessment can often imply dissatisfaction as it doesn't equate to a positive or satisfactory experience. Overall, the review can be classified as negative because it predominantly focuses on the drawbacks of the dish and the disappointment that was experienced by the diner. The critical remarks on the blandness, pungent cheese, and unmet expectations combine to form an unfavorable evaluation of the dining experience, leading to a negative review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Pelvis The pelvis consists of four bones: the right and left hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx (see Figure 8.12). The pelvis has several important functions. Its primary role is to support the weight of the upper body when sitting and to transfer this weight to the lower limbs when standing. It serves as an attachment point for trunk and lower limb muscles, and also protects the internal pelvic organs. When standing in the anatomical position, the pelvis is tilted anteriorly. In this position, the anterior superior iliac spines and the pubic tubercles lie in the same vertical plane, and the anterior (internal) surface of the sacrum faces forward and downward. The three areas of each hip bone, the ilium, pubis, and ischium, converge centrally to form a deep, cup-shaped cavity called the acetabulum. This is located on the lateral side of the hip bone and is part of the hip joint. The large opening in the anteroinferior hip bone between the ischium and pubis is the obturator foramen. This space is largely filled in by a layer of connective tissue and serves for the attachment of muscles on both its internal and external surfaces. Several ligaments unite the bones of the pelvis (Figure 8.14). The largely immobile sacroiliac joint is supported by a pair of strong ligaments that are attached between the sacrum and ilium portions of the hip bone. These are the anterior sacroiliac ligament on the anterior side of the joint and the posterior sacroiliac ligament on the posterior side. Also spanning the sacrum and hip bone are two additional ligaments. The sacrospinous ligament runs from the sacrum to the ischial spine, and the sacrotuberous ligament runs from the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity. These ligaments help to support and immobilize the sacrum as it carries the weight of the body.

Question: What ended up happening to the Pirates? Context: In 1969 the Cubs, managed by Leo Durocher, built a substantial lead in the newly created National League Eastern Division by mid-August. Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others...

Allen Toussaint (; January 14, 1938 - November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular music's great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It In 1960, Joe Banashak, of Minit Records and later Instant Records, hired Toussaint as an A&R man and record producer. He also did freelance work for other labels, such as Fury. Toussaint played piano, wrote, arranged and produced a string of hits in the early and mid-1960s for New Orleans R&B artists such as Ernie K-Doe, Chris Kenner, Irma Thomas (including \\"It's Raining\\"), Art and Aaron Neville, the Showmen, and Lee Dorsey, whose first hit \\"Ya Ya\\" he produced in 1961. The early to mid-1960s are regarded as Toussaint's most creatively successful period. Notable examples of his work are Jessie Hill's \\"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\\" (written by Hill and arranged and produced by Toussaint), Ernie K-Doe's \\"Mother-in-Law\\", and Chris Kenner's \\"I Like It Like That\\". A two-sided 1962 hit by Benny Spellman comprised \\"Lipstick Traces (on a Cigarette)\\" (covered by the O'Jays, Ringo Starr, and Alex Chilton) and the simple but effective \\"Fortune Teller\\" (covered by various 1960s rock groups, including the Rolling Stones, the Nashville Teens, the Who, the Hollies, the Throb, and ex-Searchers founder Tony Jackson). \\"Ruler of My Heart\\", written under his pseudonym Naomi Neville, first recorded by Irma Thomas for the Minit label in 1963, was adapted by Otis Redding under the title \\"Pain in My Heart\\" later that year, prompting Toussaint to file a lawsuit against Redding and his record company, Stax (the claim was settled out of court, with Stax agreeing to credit Naomi Neville as the songwriter). Redding's version of the song was also recorded by the Rolling Stones on their second album. In 1964, \\"A Certain Girl\\" (originally by Ernie K-Doe) was the B-side of the first single release by the Yardbirds. The song was released again in 1980 by Warren Zevon, as the single from the album Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School it reached 57 on Billboard's Hot 100. Mary Weiss, former lead singer of The Shangri-Las, released it as \\"A Certain Guy\\" in 2007. Toussaint credited about twenty songs to his parents, Clarence and Naomi, sometimes using the pseudonym \\"Naomi Neville\\". These include \\"Fortune Teller\\", first recorded by Benny Spellman in 1961, and \\"Work, Work, Work\\", recorded by the Artwoods in 1966. Alison Krauss and Robert Plant covered \\"Fortune Teller\\" on their 2007 album Raising Sand.

Q: Personally I enjoy doing things outside. You know, the good ol’ nature. One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet. The next day I couldn’t apply any pressure and couldn’t walk at all. I was dirty and smelly and needed some serious help on my leg but I was too far from any civilization.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. But I can use this background: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. What is an answer for this question: Which cousin experienced more thunderstorms?","completion":"Dee, who lived in the coastal town at sea level, most likely experienced more thunderstorms than Ann, who lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude. There are several reasons for this difference in thunderstorm occurrence, which can be explained by the climate, geography, and meteorological factors as outlined in the background information provided. Firstly, temperature plays a crucial role in the development of thunderstorms. Warm air at the surface rises due to convection, leading to the formation of clouds, and eventually, precipitation. Coastal areas, such as the town where Dee lives, tend to receive more direct sunlight and therefore, have a higher surface temperature compared to mountainous areas. This results in greater potential for convective activity and an increased likelihood of thunderstorms. In contrast, higher altitudes like Ann's mountain village tend to have cooler temperatures due to the adiabatic lapse rate. As the background information mentioned, mountaintops might sometimes be warmer than the valleys below, due to an inversion phenomenon. However, this generally suppresses thunderstorm development because inversions act as a cap that prevents warm air from rising and forming the necessary cloud formations for thunderstorms. Another factor that makes thunderstorms more likely in coastal areas is the abundance of moisture. Coastal regions are typically more humid due to the proximity to a large body of water, such as an ocean. The increased humidity provides more water vapor for cloud formation, which is an essential ingredient for a thunderstorm. In the mountainous areas, the air is generally drier, and moisture content is lower. Lastly, local topography and surface characteristics can also influence the frequency of thunderstorms. Coastal towns like Dee's are often subject to sea breezes, wherein cooler air from the ocean moves inland and creates converging air currents, leading to rising air and the development of thunderstorms. Ann's mountain village, on the other hand, might experience more stable air conditions due to the surrounding terrain, which makes it less likely for thunderstorms to form. In conclusion, based on the factors such as temperature, humidity, and geography, it is more likely that Dee, the cousin living in the coastal town at sea level, experiences more thunderstorms than Ann, who resides in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits? The answer is:","completion":"Wolf island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits. The reason behind this is that Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, which is a key evolutionary process driving the adaptations of species. Natural selection occurs when individuals with favorable heritable traits (traits genetically passed down from their parents) are more likely to survive and reproduce in their environment than those without these traits. Over time, this leads to an increase in the frequency of beneficial traits in the population and results in a more diverse array of well-adapted species. Loon island, on the other hand, had a very stable environment and fewer diverse species. This suggests that there has been less pressure for species to evolve and adapt in response to environmental challenges, and therefore fewer opportunities for beneficial heritable traits to arise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that said \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\"? During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

Born to father Tihomir (or Tih), he ascended to the Bulgarian throne following the death of his predecessor, Mitso Asen. His reign marks a period of significant changes within the Bulgarian realm. Although not many details are known about his early life, it is evident that Constantine Tikh played a crucial role in shaping the political and social landscape of Bulgaria during his rule. As a ruler, he faced several challenges, including adversaries within the country and external forces trying to exert their influence on the Bulgarian territory. Constantine Tikh's reign was characterized by both political and cultural developments. One of his significant achievements was maintaining and consolidating power, ensuring a smooth transition from his predecessor while also making changes in the political arena as per the needs of the time. He was married to Irene Doukaina Laskarina Maria Palaiologina, a Byzantine noblewoman, who played an essential role in establishing alliances and extending the sphere of Bulgarian influence. This marriage not only solidified his status as the ruler but also expanded Bulgaria's diplomatic relations and connections. Despite his many achievements, Constantine Tikh's rule came to an end in 1277. His successor, Ivaylo, took over the reins of the Bulgarian kingdom. Though Constantine Tikh's reign was relatively short compared to other rulers in Bulgarian history, his impact on the political, social, and cultural aspects of the country left an indelible mark on Bulgarian history.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not. Citizens of which city should be less concerned about sink holes? The answer is:","completion":"Citizens of Tichago should be less concerned about sink holes, as their mayor confirmed that they are not experiencing soil piping."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Context: I was 35 weeks pregnant when I had my stroke. For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside.

I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor.

Start with the equation: -7 = -j - 9 2. The goal is to isolate \\"j,\\" so let's begin by moving the constant term (-9) to the other side of the equation. To do this, add 9 to both sides of the equation: -7 + 9 = -j - 9 + 9 3. Simplify both sides of the equation: 2 = -j 4. Now we need to remove the negative sign in front of the j. To do this, multiply (or divide) both sides of the equation by -1: 2 * -1 = -j * -1 5.

You are given a new situation: David was studying for his chemistry exam. To understand the elements of the periodic table better he categorized them into three groups, cat A, cat B, and cat C. In cat A he placed all the elements with atomic numbers lower than 83. In cat B he put the elements with atomic numbers from 83 to 94. Finally, in cat C he placed the elements with atomic numbers over 94. He found it easier to see their differences after he categorized them. and a hint : Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 82 each have at least one stable isotope (except for technetium, element 43 and promethium, element 61, which have no stable isotopes). Isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these elements, notably bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90), and uranium (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy metals before the formation of our Solar System. At over 1.9×1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element, and is almost always considered on par with the 80 stable elements.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrasing each other as both are asking for an explanation of the Panic of 1907 in understandable terms. I will provide a detailed answer below. The Panic of 1907, also known as the 1907 Banker's Panic, was a financial crisis that took place in the United States. To explain it in layman's terms, it was a period of severe financial turmoil and panic during which several banks and businesses failed, leading to significant monetary losses and social hardships. The Panic of 1907 can be traced back to a variety of factors that contributed to its occurrence: 1. Economic Expansion and Speculation: Prior to 1907, there was a period of economic expansion in the United States, with significant growth in industries such as railroads, mining, and telecommunications. This led to a lot of speculation (i.e., people investing heavily in the stock market, hoping to make quick profits). This speculative behavior created an unstable financial environment, as share prices were artificially inflated and not reflective of the actual value of the companies. 2. The San Francisco Earthquake (1906): The devastating earthquake and the subsequent fires in San Francisco led to massive property losses and required huge amounts of money for rebuilding efforts. This put pressure on the financial system, as insurance companies and other financial institutions struggled to meet the sudden demand for cash. 3. The Heinze-Morse chain of events: In 1907, two businessmen, F. Augustus Heinze and Charles W. Morse, attempted to corner the market on United Copper. Their maneuver ultimately failed, causing the price of United Copper stock to collapse. This event triggered a chain reaction, leading to runs on banks affiliated with Heinze and Morse, and eventually spreading panic to other banks and trust companies. 4. Inadequate banking regulations: At the time, the U.S. banking system was not well-regulated, making it susceptible to fraud and instability. Many banks were overextended, meaning they had loaned out more money than they had in reserves (cash or other assets that could be quickly liquidated to meet demands). This inability to meet the demands for cash, coupled with depositors' widespread fear, led to a wave of bank runs in which customers raced to withdraw their funds. 5. Lack of a central bank: In 1907, the United States did not have a central bank or entity to oversee and stabilize the financial system during times of crisis. The Federal Reserve, which now serves this role, was not established until 1913 in response to the panic and other financial crises. The consequences of the Panic of 1907 were far-reaching, leading to numerous bank failures, business bankruptcies, and a decline in economic activity in the United States. This crisis also highlighted the need for financial reform and increased government oversight, eventually leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. In conclusion, the Panic of 1907 was a financial crisis driven by speculation, major events such as the San Francisco earthquake, inadequately regulated financial institutions, and an absence of central banking authority. The crisis ultimately led to significant economic hardships in the United States and paved the way for the establishment of the Federal Reserve System."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who tells Jessica not to leave her post?, using the article: Jessica Loren, a rookie police officer on her first assignment, is ordered to take the last shift at a police station before it is permanently closed. Her mother pleads with her not to take the job, as her father, also a police officer, was killed while on duty. After assuring her mother that the shift will be uneventful, she reports for duty. Loren surprises her commanding officer Cohen, who demands that she turn around. He leads her on a brief tour, during which he explains that a HAZMAT team will be there shortly to collect evidence that is difficult to dispose of and that she is not permitted to leave her post. Before he leaves, he gives Loren his phone number in case of emergency. Loren becomes bored and almost falls asleep, though she wakes when she hears knocking. She does not see anyone at the door but turns around to find a homeless man standing in the hallway; he urinates on the floor and refuses to leave. Loren takes him to a holding cell, where the door suddenly closes and locks behind her. The lights go out, a bloody-faced person surprises her in the door's window, and she drops her flashlight. An unidentified person picks it up and taunts her. When the lights come back on, the door opens and no one is there., what would be the answer ?

Peter cut the tip of his finger one day with a sharp blade. The manager sent Peter to get medical help. Peter saw a doctor who tended to Peter's wound. Peter was back to work within a few days. Hypothesis: Peter came back to work a few days after his wound was treated.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Peter came back to work a few days after his wound was treated from the given context. The context provides us with enough information to support this hypothesis. To form a detailed and long answer, let's break down the context into various key points: 1. Peter worked as a chef in a restaurant. This point lets us know Peter's profession and his workplace, which is relevant to understanding the situation. 2. Peter cut the tip of his finger one day with a sharp blade. This tells us about the incident that resulted in Peter injuring himself. It is important to know the nature of the injury to assess its severity and whether it could have an impact on his return to work. 3. The manager sent Peter to get medical help. This point indicates that the injury was significant enough for the manager to react and send Peter to receive proper medical assistance. It also suggests that the manager cared for Peter's well-being and wanted to make sure that he would recover properly before returning to work. 4. Peter saw a doctor who tended to Peter's wound. This information is crucial as it informs us that Peter was given professional medical care, increasing the likelihood of proper healing. The doctor may have cleaned the wound, sutured it if necessary, and possibly prescribed medication to reduce the risk of infection and/or pain. 5. Peter was back to work within a few days. This point confirms that Peter returned to his job at the restaurant after a relatively short period, suggesting that the treatment he received was effective and his recovery was successful. Considering all of these key points from the context, we can confidently conclude that the hypothesis is accurate: Peter came back to work a few days after his wound was treated. The story provides enough information about the nature of Peter's injury, his visit to the doctor, and his subsequent recovery to support the hypothesis that he successfully returned to work within a few days."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: (I). no; (II). yes;","completion":"(II). Yes, it is possible to draw the conclusion that \\"The chair was broken, so he had to stand instead.\\" based on the given statement \\"Sam pulled up a chair to the piano, but it was broken, so he had to stand instead.\\" The statement presents a clear causal relationship between the broken chair and Sam's need to stand. Here's a breakdown of the events in the statement: 1. Sam pulled up a chair to the piano: This action shows Sam's intent to use the chair. 2. The chair was broken: This condition of the chair prevented Sam from using it as intended. 3. He had to stand instead: As a result of the broken chair, Sam needed to find an alternative to sitting, which in this case was standing. The conclusion \\"The chair was broken, so he had to stand instead.\\" maintains the cause-and-effect relationship presented in the original statement.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:In the documentary, some relatives of the six victims said a Crown Office official had given them inaccurate information about the driver. Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland later criticised the BBC for broadcasting \\"inaccuracies and innuendo\\". Adam Russell said he was \\"stunned\\" by Mr Mulholland's \\"imprudent\\" comments. The crash killed Mr Russell's 51-year-old mother, Jacqueline Morton, who was from Glasgow. She died along with Erin McQuade and Jack and Lorraine Sweeney, from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire, Stephenie Tait, 29, from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh. Another 15 people were injured when the lorry veered out of control on 22 December 2014, after the driver, Harry Clarke, blacked out behind the wheel. In a statement, Mr Russell said: \\"My family have been poorly treated by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service from beginning to end and their continued defence of an indefensible position only undermines public confidence in them.\\" The Crown Office responded by saying it had been concerned by the factual inaccuracies in the documentary and the lack of balance it provided. It also said it denied the comments which had been attributed to an official. A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into the crash, which is due to report back early next year, heard that Mr Clarke had previously fainted at the wheel of a bus, in April 2010. The BBC documentary, Lies, Laws and the Bin Lorry Tragedy, broadcast on 3 November heard from Mr Russell and Robyn and Lucy Ewing, the daughters of Gillian Ewing. Mr Russell said that he attended a meeting with Crown Official David Green, just over two weeks after the Crown decided not to prosecute Harry Clarke. He told the documentary: \\"David Green proceeded to tell us that Mr Clarke had had a one-off episode which occurred in April 2010 whereby he'd fainted in a canteen, in a hot environment, and this was a one-off event.\\" Mr Russell said that some weeks later, his lawyers were sent productions from the Crown and he learned a different version of the blackout - that Harry Clarke had fainted at the wheel of a bus. Lucy Ewing, who was with her mother when she was hit by the bin lorry, also recalled: \\"We were specifically told he passed out in a canteen. No mention of on a bus.\\" This is viewed as significant by the relatives as Mr Clarke's 2010 faint was not reported to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). If, however, a driver blacked out while sitting, and if they lost consciousness at the wheel, then they would have to notify the DVLA, and could have their licence restricted. During the documentary, the two families questioned whether the Crown Office was aware of all the evidence when they made the decision not to prosecute Mr Clarke. They also accused the Crown Office of misleading them. The Crown Office told the BBC documentary that it was aware that Mr Clarke had fainted on a bus when it decided not to prosecute and that all evidence was disclosed to families before the FAI. It has since emerged, however, that Lord Advocate Frank Mullholland was highly critical of the BBC programme and defended his own staff in an internal memo that was later published in The Herald newspaper. In the memo, Mr Mullholland criticised the BBC for broadcasting \\"inaccuracies and innuendo\\" over the Crown Office's handling of the crash. He also described the programme as a \\"sensationalist documentary\\". Responding to the Lord Advocate's comments, Mr Russell said: \\"Having read the leaked memo on Twitter last week regarding Mr Mulholland's and Catherine Dyer's response to a BBC documentary which I was a part of, I once again feel the need to speak out. \\"I am frustrated that I have to do this as I feel the imprudent comments of Mr Mulholland are a distraction from the impending determination of the fatal accident inquiry.\\" Mr Russell added: \\"Given Mr Mulholland was aware that David Green did not give us the same version of events that Mr Mulholland claims to have been aware of, I was stunned to see the uncritical support of David Green.\\" BBC Scotland said that it stood by \\"the integrity and accuracy of its journalism\\" in the documentary and rejected \\"the general, but non-specific, criticisms reported to be in the Crown Office internal note\\". The statement added: \\"Their internal note reportedly claimed that BBC Scotland wrongly said that the Crown was unaware that the driver had had an episode of impaired consciousness at the wheel of a bus when it decided not to take criminal proceedings. \\"The documentary did not make any such assertion. \\"What we did report was that all the families featured are certain there was no mention of the loss of consciousness at the wheel of a bus at separate meetings between them and Crown officers in March.\\" The statement concluded: \\"Throughout production of the programme, BBC Scotland engaged appropriately and comprehensively with the Crown Office and included responses they gave. \\"That included a request for interview with the Lord Advocate on the issues raised - an offer that was declined, but which remains on offer.\\" A statement from the Crown Office said: \\"The Crown Office has repeatedly explained in public that we had all the relevant evidence before the decision was taken not to prosecute the driver of the bin lorry. \\"We were concerned by the factual inaccuracies contained in a recent documentary and the lack of balance it provided and took steps to inform staff of the factual position. \\"The Crown has consistently made it clear that the comments attributed to an official regarding Mr Clarke were denied.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"In this article, a man named Adam Russell is upset because he feels like he and his family have been treated poorly by some officials.

This makes them very upset and some people are saying that the official gave wrong information on purpose.

What is the best way to: How do I remove vinyl wall art from the walls?","completion":"The best way to remove vinyl wall art from the walls involves a step-by-step process to ensure minimal damage to your walls. Follow these steps carefully: 1. Gather the necessary tools: To remove vinyl wall art, you will need a hairdryer or heat gun, a plastic scraper or old credit card, a pair of tweezers or needle-nose pliers, a clean, soft cloth, and possibly adhesive remover or rubbing alcohol. 2. Clean the wall area: Before beginning the removal process, clean the wall area surrounding the vinyl art with a soft cloth or sponge to remove any dust or dirt. 3. Warm-up the vinyl: Use a hairdryer or heat gun to gently warm up the vinyl wall art, focusing on the edges. This makes the adhesive more pliable and easier to remove. Set the hairdryer to low or medium heat and hold it about 6-8 inches away from the wall. Make sure to direct the heat evenly across the surface. Be cautious not to overheat the vinyl or wall, as this may cause damage. 4. Test a small area: Carefully lift a corner or edge of the vinyl art with your fingernail or tweezers. If it comes off easily, proceed to the next step. If it's still difficult to remove, apply more heat and try again. 5. Slowly peel off the vinyl: Once a corner or edge has been lifted, use your plastic scraper or old credit card to gently pry the vinyl away from the wall at a 45-degree angle. Work slowly and patiently, applying heat as needed to keep the adhesive pliable. If the vinyl starts to tear or break apart, use tweezers or needle-nose pliers to continue to lift the edges. 6. Remove any residual adhesive: After you've removed the vinyl wall art, there might be some adhesive residue left on the wall. To remove this, you can use adhesive remover or rubbing alcohol. Dab a small amount onto the clean, soft cloth and gently wipe away the residue, being cautious not to damage the wall paint. If using an adhesive remover, follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper use. 7. Clean the wall: Once the adhesive residue has been removed, clean the wall again with a soft cloth or sponge and mild soap to remove any leftover residue or dirt. Allow the wall to dry completely. 8. Inspect the wall: Check the wall for any damage, such as lifted paint or imperfections caused by the removal process. If you notice any damage, you may need to touch up the paint or repair the wall as needed. By following these steps, you can remove vinyl wall art from your walls with minimal damage. Remember always to work patiently, apply heat evenly, and use the appropriate tools to ensure the best results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Title: Invincible Movie plot: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts.

But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species. Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo. To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready.

Weldon Gaston \\"Hum\\" Humble (April 24, 1921 - April 14, 1998) was an American football guard who played five seasons in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland Browns and Dallas Texans in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Humble grew up in Texas and was a multi-sport athlete at Brackenridge High School in San Antonio. He enrolled at Rice University in Houston, Texas in 1940 and played three seasons on the school's football team. Humble then spent three years in the U.S. Marines during World War II, serving in the Pacific War and earning a Bronze Star Medal before returning to complete his college studies in 1946. Humble was born in Nixon, Texas, a suburb of San Antonio, in 1921. His athletic career began at San Antonio's Brackenridge High School. Humble played as an end for two seasons and a fullback for a third season on the football team. He also played on the basketball, track and swimming teams before graduating and enrolling at Rice University in Houston, Texas in 1940. Humble began play on Rice's freshman team as an end in 1940. He advanced to the varsity team the next year. While he started as an end, coach Jess Neely switched him to guard before the first game of the season. He thrived in the new position, and was named a sophomore all-star by the Associated Press after the Rice Owls finished 1941 with a 6-3-1 win-loss-tie record. The following year, Humble earned All-Southwestern Conference honors and won the George Martin Award, given to Rice's most valuable player, as Rice put up a 7-2-1 record. Humble left Rice in 1943 for the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then called Southwestern Louisiana Institute, to prepare for service in World War II in a V-12 U.S. Navy training program. As he trained, he played alongside enlistees from Tulane University, the University of Tulsa and Louisiana State University on a military team that won six straight games and was selected to play in the first Oil Bowl in Houston. Captained by Humble, Southwestern beat a service team from Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio. After the season, Humble enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and was sent to fight in the Pacific War. He rose to the rank of first lieutenant and won a Bronze Star Medal. Upon his discharge in 1946, Humble returned to Rice. He lettered in football and track and field and was voted a consensus first-team All-American guard while captain of Rice's Southwestern Conference co-champion team. He was also named lineman of the week by the Associated Press in November for his strong tackling in a game against the Texas A&M Aggies. After finishing with an 8-2 record, Rice beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl game in early 1947. Rice was ranked the 10th-best college team in the nation in the AP Poll.

Answer:","completion":"The nickname of the opponent who lost a title fight to Theodore \\"Tiger\\" Flowers was Harry \\"The Human Hairpin\\" Greb. Harry Greb was an American professional boxer who competed in the sport from 1913 to 1926. He was known for his aggressive fighting style, incredible punching speed, and ability to take a considerable amount of punishment in the ring. Greb's nickname, \\"The Human Hairpin,\\" was derived from his evasive style in which he would bend over at the waist, making himself a difficult target to hit while launching a barrage of punches at his opponents. On February 26, 1926, Harry Greb faced Theodore \\"Tiger\\" Flowers at Madison Square Garden in New York City for the World Middleweight boxing title. Flowers, an African-American fighter from Georgia, was a skilled boxer known for his smooth skills, speed, and southpaw stance. During the fight, the two fighters engaged in a fierce battle with each fighter displaying their unique style and skills in the ring. Greb, with his aggressive approach and relentless pressure, was countered by Flowers' smooth boxing skills, strong defense, and tactical prowess. As the fight continued, Flowers began to establish a rhythm and maintain control against Greb's constant attacks. Ultimately, it was Flowers who came out victorious in this battle, winning a 15-round split decision over Greb, and became the first African-American to capture the World Middleweight title.

In both statements, the subject is a baby. This checks out. Step 2: Compare the use of a whisk. Both statements mention the baby using a whisk. While the spelling in Statement 2 is \\"wisk,\\" the intended meaning is clear. This checks out. Step 3: Compare the context involving cookie batter/dough. Statement 1 mentions that the baby is covered with cookie batter, while Statement 2 states that the baby is flinging cookie dough. Despite the minor difference in wording (batter vs. dough), the context is similar. This checks out. Step 4: Compare the baby's actions and emotions. Statement 1 mentions the baby waving the whisk around. In Statement 2, the baby is gurgling with delight and flinging cookie dough using the whisk. While the specific actions are slightly different, the overall concept of the baby actively engaging with the whisk and cookie batter/dough is consistent. This checks out.

Both discuss a baby using a whisk and engaging with cookie batter/dough in a playful manner. The second statement simply adds the baby's emotional response (gurgling with delight) to the situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Angel Thomas is the country's youngest shopkeeper - running a pet clothing store in Liverpool. The 11-year-old balances her schoolwork with managing accounts, logging sales and promoting the site online. She runs a city centre store and balances school work with managing the accounts, processing sales and promoting her enterprise on the internet. She has just taught herself to sew and knit so she can create her own range of designer doggy fashions. ‘I’ve always wanted to be successful and run my own business,’ she said yesterday. ‘I love being my own boss and I really enjoy going to work.’ Angel has just taught herself how to sew so she can start making her own range of products. The schoolgirl recently gave her mother a prestigious 'employee of the month' award. The extraordinary enthusiasm Angel applies to her trade has produced steady sales since Pawabella opened its doors two months ago in Gostins Arcade, a collection of independent shops in a small mall in the heart of Liverpool. Every evening she rushes home from school to update her Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook accounts, checks the store’s website for orders that need to be processed and answers enquiries from customers. All her free time, holidays and weekends are spent running the shop, which she leases in the name of her mother Anita. The schoolgirl convinced her to save the money she spent on music lessons for her daughter - and to use it instead as capital for the business venture. This picture shows just some of the products the schoolgirl has on offer at her Liverpool shop. More of the fabulous doggy outfits on sale in the store.

Ingested food and water enter the body through the mouth and pass through the gastrointestinal tract, where they are broken down into essential nutrients. Eventually, these nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and distributed throughout the body, with the pancreas playing an essential role in breaking down carbohydrates and aiding the digestion of other foods and liquids. The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned is related to the consumption of less chewed up wax, which we can consider as larger pieces of poorly chewed food. The question is whether this would affect the pancreas to work less efficiently or \\"softer.\\" To answer this question, let's go over the primary functions of the pancreas in the digestive process. The pancreas serves two main roles: 1. Exocrine function: The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes and a bicarbonate-rich fluid into the duodenum of the small intestine. These enzymes help in breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Examples of these enzymes are amylase, trypsin, and lipase, which break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, respectively. 2. Endocrine function: The pancreas produces hormones like insulin and glucagon, which help regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels, while glucagon raises them. Balancing blood sugar levels is crucial to maintaining overall health and energy levels. Now, let's consider the supposed perturbation of consuming less chewed up wax, or larger food particles, and its impact on the pancreas: 1. In the case of consuming poorly chewed or larger food particles, the stomach has to work harder to break them down into smaller pieces through churning and the action of hydrochloric acid and other gastric juices. Consequently, this might slow down the overall digestion process. However, the pancreas would still secrete its digestive enzymes into the small intestine to break down these larger food particles. The pancreas might not work \\"softer,\\" but the gastric step in the digestion process could take longer to prepare the food for pancreatic enzyme action. 2. The endocrine function of the pancreas remains largely unaffected by the size of food particles. The production of insulin and glucagon is influenced mainly by the concentration of sugars (glucose) in the blood, which results from the complete breakdown and absorption of carbohydrates. Therefore, even if the digestion process is slower due to the less chewed up wax, the pancreas's endocrine function would still operate in response to the blood sugar levels. In conclusion, the perturbation of consuming less chewed up wax or larger food particles might slow down the digestion process, particularly in the stomach, before the pancreatic enzymes are engaged. However, it might not necessarily make the pancreas work \\"softer\\" or less efficiently, as the pancreas would still secrete the necessary enzymes and hormones to break down nutrients and regulate blood sugar levels. The overall impact of this perturbation would be a slower digestion process before the pancreatic enzymes come into play and still maintaining a counterbalancing endocrine function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Begin leaving the cage outside during the day so other sparrows can visit. If you are avoiding close interaction with the bird and it is interacting with wild sparrows, then its chances of re-acclimating to the wild are much better. If the baby bird is not interacting with wild birds then it needs to learn the songs of its species another way. This will allow it to communicate with other birds when it is released. There are audio files available online that you can play for the bird. Let it hop around on the grass after about 7-10 days old. If releasing the bird is your ultimate goal, try putting it in open space areas so they can learn to fly. Instinct will teach the bird to fly and discover what its wings are for. Wait until it has wing feathers, then if it doesn't seem to know what to do then its probably isn't ready. To test out whether he's ready, take him outside and place him on the ground in an area that's safe from predators. Leave the bird to its own devices for 20 minutes, if nothing happens bring it back indoors and try again another day. If you're going to release it, make sure the baby can eat on its own.

A few days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions her as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman, whose severed limb was found in her garden. They flirt despite the grisly nature of their introduction, and meet at the same bar later. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows more disillusioned with the attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez. Even as Malloy defends his partner, who can no longer carry a gun because he threatened his unfaithful wife, he promises he will do anything she wants except hit her. She leaves abruptly and is assaulted walking home, but calls Malloy and their affair begins that night. Frannie recognizes the detective's tattoo, from the man in the basement of the bar, and asks her sister Pauline if she would trust a man who got a blow job in a bar. Pauline says yes, but Frannie is still suspicious. After Malloy tells her that she and the first victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, and she might have seen the murderer, she begins to suspect that Malloy may actually be the killer, especially after a second victim is found. But later she goes with him to a woodsy spot by the water, where he scares her by shooting at garbage bags floating on the surface, then tells her she should learn how to shoot. She surprises herself by taking aim and shooting well, before they head back to the city. She finds her old boyfriend in her bed when she gets home, and goes back to her sister's apartment, where she finds the door open and Pauline's dismembered body. She is now more frightened of Malloy than ever, but goes home and gets drunk, and almost stumbles into bed with her student before throwing him out. Malloy's partner is outside watching as the young man runs out, and Frannie shouts out the window... The answer is:","completion":"Whispers in the Dark"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: MASH Context: The plot is told as a series of (presumably chronological) vignettes surrounding the life of the namesake Mobile Army Surgical Hospital where it is set. While the episodic film lacks the cohesion of an overarching singular plot with a traditional narrative structure, the vignettes do present a clear means for the film to explore the themes of military life. Set in 1951 in South Korea, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is assigned two replacements: Captains \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. As the film progresses, further scenes introduce additional characters. Some characters are already at the camp when Hawkeye and Duke arrive, such as the bumbling commander Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, the morose dentist Walter \\"Painless\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy. Other characters arrive after Hawkeye and Duke, and become integrated into camp life, such as surgeon Trapper John and Nurse Margaret Houlihan. After the characters are introduced, which forms the opening act, further comedic episodes explore the evolving relationships between the characters. The main characters in the camp divide into two factions; Hawkeye, Duke, and Trapper John form one faction; all three were drafted into the army and are not as dedicated to the mission or lifestyle of the military. They are prone to pranks and heavy drinking. The other faction forms around the romantic relationship between Majors Houlihan and Burns, who are both career military personnel. The two factions battle back and forth in a series of pranks and reprisals (one involving exposing a naked Houlihan to the camp when the walls of the shower tent are collapsed, another embarrassing the couple by exposing their heretofore secret romance) until Burns is goaded into punching Hawkeye and removed from the unit for... Answer:","completion":"Major Frank Burns is goaded into punching Hawkeye in the movie MASH. The characters in the camp are divided into two factions, one comprising Hawkeye, Duke, and Trapper John, and the other forming around the romantic relationship between Majors Houlihan and Burns. As the story progresses, the two factions engage in a series of pranks and retaliations, leading to increased tension between them. The culmination of these events occurs when Burns becomes so frustrated and provoked that he punches Hawkeye, resulting in his removal from the unit. This incident further emphasizes the contrasting personalities and values between the drafted surgeons like Hawkeye and the career military personnel like Major Burns, leading to ongoing conflicts and engaging storylines throughout the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to cook pork crackling Purchase a pork roast or joint, preferably either belly or shoulder. This recipe can only be done with a thick layer of fat atop the roast. Some cooks insist the pork belly and shoulder, two fatty cuts of meat, produce the best crackling. Available choices: [i] Defrost the meat in the refrigerator for 12 to 36 hours if it is frozen. Remove it from the refrigerator and place it in a roasting pan with the fat layer facing up. [ii] The meat can usually be cut before roasting. Heat oil in a medium pan or small skillet. [iii] Place the roast in the refrigerator and let the pork roast rest for one hour before carving (slicing the roast vertically). Depending on the size of your roast, this will take place anywhere between 8 and 15 minutes. [iv] For tougher pork, cut open the neck and flesh of the pork roast and apply a heavy layer of fat to the meat. Hot fat will tenderize the pork, leaving it tender and flavorful as the fat melts.","completion":"[i] Defrost the meat in the refrigerator for 12 to 36 hours if it is frozen. Remove it from the refrigerator and place it in a roasting pan with the fat layer facing up. Allow the meat to come to room temperature for about 30 minutes to ensure even cooking. During this time, preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F). [ii] The meat can usually be cut before roasting, however, for the best crackling experience, it's advised to score the fat layer instead. Using a sharp knife, make shallow cuts across the fat layer approximately 1 cm apart, being careful not to cut fully into the meat. Then, season the scored fat layer with a generous amount of coarse salt and pepper, rubbing it well into the cuts. This will help to draw out moisture, enabling the fat to crisp up while cooking. Once your oven has reached the desired temperature, place the roasting pan with the seasoned pork into the oven. Roast the meat for 30 minutes at the high heat, until the skin starts to puff up and become crispy. This initial high-heat phase is essential to achieving perfect crackling. After the initial high-heat cooking, reduce the oven temperature to 180°C (350°F). Continue cooking the pork roast at this lower temperature for approximately 1 hour per kilogram, or until the meat is cooked through and tender. It's recommended to use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature of the roast reaches 65°C (150°F) for medium doneness or 75°C (165°F) for well-done. While the pork roast is cooking, you can prepare any desired side dishes, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad. [iv] For tougher pork, you may opt to occasionally baste the roast with the rendered fat from the roasting pan. This will help to keep the meat moist and tender as it cooks. However, avoid basting the crackling itself, as introducing moisture may prevent it from crisping up effectively. [iii] Once your pork roast reaches the desired internal temperature and the crackling is golden-brown and crispy, remove the roasting pan from the oven. Transfer the roast to a serving platter or cutting board, and cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Place the roast in the refrigerator and let it rest for one hour before carving. Resting the meat is essential for retaining its juiciness and preventing the loss of flavorful juices upon carving. After the resting period, remove the roast from the fridge and carve it into slices, taking care to serve each portion with a generous piece of crackling. Serve your sliced pork roast with the prepared side dishes and enjoy a delicious homemade meal with friends or family!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.
