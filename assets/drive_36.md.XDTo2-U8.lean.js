Please briefly summarize this news article: Libyan Rebels Report Gains in Misrata Fighting TRIPOLI, Libya -- Rebels battled Muammar Qaddafi's troops Thursday for control of central Misrata, driving dozens of snipers from tall buildings in hours of urban warfare and gaining a tactical advantage in the only major city held by the opposition in western Libya, witnesses said. The Libyan government, meanwhile, ramped up its rhetoric against NATO, warning that \\"it will be hell\\" for the alliance if it sends in ground troops, even though Britain's prime minister said the Western nations were not moving toward such a deployment. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya. The drones allow for low-level precision attacks and are uniquely suited for urban areas such as Misrata, where NATO airpower has been unable to protect civilians when Qaddafi's forces are operating inside the city. Also Thursday, rebels captured a Libyan border crossing into Tunisia, forcing government soldiers to flee over the frontier and possibly opening a new channel for opposition forces in Qaddafi's bastion in western part of the country. At least seven people were killed in Thursday's fighting for the main Misrata thoroughfare of Tripoli Street, bringing to 20 the number slain in three days in Libya's third-largest city. Misrata has been besieged by government forces for nearly two months, with human rights groups estimating hundreds of people killed. Tripoli Street is the site where two Western photojournalists were killed Wednesday as the rebels tried to dislodge the snipers loyal to Qaddafi perched on rooftops. The street, which stretches from the heart of Misrata to a major highway southwest of the city of 300,000 people, has become a front line for the rebels and Qaddafi's forces. The rebels took over several buildings along parts of the street, enabling them to cut off supplies to a Qaddafi unit and dozens of rooftop snipers who have terrorized civilians and kept them trapped in their homes, said a doctor who identified himself only as Ayman for fear of retaliation. \\"This battle cost us lots of blood and martyrs,\\" the doctor said. Residents celebrated and chanted \\"God is great\\" after the snipers left a battle-scarred insurance building that is the highest point in central Misrata, according to a witness who identified himself only as Sohaib. \\"Thanks to God, the snipers fled, leaving nothing behind at the insurance building after they were cut off from supplies -- ammunition, food and water -- for days,\\" added another resident, Abdel Salam. He called it \\"a major victory\\" because the structure gave the pro-Qaddafi forces a commanding view of the city. In Tripoli, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed Qaddafi forces control more than 80 percent of the city and the rebels hold \\"the seaport and the area surrounding it.\\" Residents said that at the beginning of the battle for Misrata, the government deployed tanks and shelled the city indiscriminately, forcing residents to flee their homes and businesses, which were taken over by Qaddafi's forces. NATO commanders have admitted their airpower was limited in being able to protect civilians in cities like Misrata, which was the main mission of the international air campaign. Abdel Salam, who asked to be identified only by his given name for fear of retribution, said Qaddafi's forces were using tanks and rocket-propelled grenades. \\"Col. Qaddafi's troops continue their vicious attacks, including the siege of Misrata,\\" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in Washington. \\"There are even reports that Qaddafi forces may have used cluster bombs against their own people.\\" Libyan officials have persistently denied the use of cluster bombs, which indiscriminately spray small bomblets over a wide area and are particularly lethal in residential areas. However, Human Rights Watch has said it found evidence of cluster bombs being used by government forces in Misrata. Earlier this week, Britain, Italy and France said they were sending military officers to advise the rebels, prompting speculation that this was a step toward sending in ground forces at a time when NATO airstrikes were failing to break the battlefield stalemate or protect civilians in Misrata. Ibrahim, the government spokesman, warned that NATO would find itself entangled in fighting ordinary Libyans if its soldiers were to set foot on Libyan soil. \\"We are arming the whole population, not to fight the rebels, by the way, because the rebels are very easy -- they are not a challenge for us,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"What we are fighting is NATO now.\\" Ibrahim said the Qaddafi regime is ready to observe an immediate cease-fire and negotiate the terms of political transition. Rebels have said Qaddafi must step down before such talks can begin. \\"We are ready and accepting peace ... but we are also ready for war,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"If NATO comes, it will be hell.\\" But British Prime Minister David Cameron insisted NATO isn't edging toward deploying ground troops in Libya. Italy, France and Britain are sending experienced combat advisers to help train and organize Libya's opposition forces dislodge Qaddafi after four decades in power. Ministers have insisted the officers won't play any role in offensives against Qaddafi's troops -- and have repeatedly said NATO and allies won't overstep boundaries set out in the United Nations resolution authorizing action in Libya. \\"We're not allowed, rightly, to have an invading army, or an occupying army,\\" Cameron told BBC Scotland radio. \\"That's not what we want, that's not what the Libyans want, that's not what the world wants.\\" The capture of the border crossing with Tunisia in western Libya followed three days of intense fighting outside the desert town of Nalut, about 140 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Tripoli, said a rebel leader, Shaban Abu Sitta. The area was briefly in hands of anti-government forces last month before Libyan troops moved in. Holding the Dhuheiba border crossing could open important supply routes for anti-Qaddafi forces and give the rebels another foothold in western Libya. After taking control of the crossing early Thursday, rebels raised the pre-Qaddafi tricolor flag. In recent weeks, more than 10,000 Libyans from the border region had crossed into Tunisia, and 1,200 found shelter in a tent camp near the village of Dhuheiba, a few miles from the border. When people in the camp learned of the takeover of the crossing, they chanted, \\"The rebels brought freedom to their town.\\" By afternoon, hundreds of Libyan refugees had assembled at the crossing, waiting to return home. Also Thursday, the Greek passenger ferry Ionian Spirit carried more than 1,000 people fleeing Misrata to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in eastern Libya, where 30 ambulances were waiting. The ship's passengers included dozens of wounded and shell-shocked Libyans, hundreds of migrant workers from Africa, as well as smaller groups from Pakistan, Nigeria and the Philippines. Four of the injured were seriously hurt It also carried the bodies of two photojournalists killed in Misrata on Wednesday: Chris Hondros, a New York-based photographer for Getty Images, and British-born Tim Hetherington, co-director of the 2010 Afghanistan war documentary \\"Restrepo\\" that was nominated for an Academy Award. Also aboard was the body of a Ukrainian doctor who was killed by an artillery blast in Misrata. Several banners were hung to greet the ferry. One said: \\"U.K. and U.S., your blood was mixed with ours in Misrata.\\"","completion":"The article talks about the battle between Libyan rebels and forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi in central Misrata. The rebels managed to take control after hours of fighting and managed to drive away enemy snipers from tall buildings, gaining a strategic advantage. Despite this, the Libyan government escalated its warning against NATO, threatening severe consequences if ground troops were deployed. However, British authorities maintained that they were not planning such a deployment. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates confirmed that President Obama approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya, specifically due to their suitability for low-level precision attacks in urban areas. The rebels also secured a significant win by capturing a Libyan border crossing into Tunisia, pushing government opposing forces back over the frontier. This victory may allow the rebels to open up a new channel in their fight against Qaddafi in the western part of the country. Despite these developments, the cost was high with at least seven people killed in the fighting, bringing the total death toll in three days to 20 in Libya's third-largest city. Misrata has been under siege by government forces for nearly two months. Government forces denied using cluster bombs against civilians which was contradicted by Human Rights Watch, who found evidence of their usage. There's also an update on the status of foreign involvement in Libya - Britain, Italy, France are sending military officers to provide advisory roles to the rebels. They clarify that these officers will not participate directly in offensives against Qaddafi's forces. Moreover, the rebels took control of Dhuheiba border crossing, which may lead to important supply routes for the opposition forces.

WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

A secret coven of Cornish witches first formed in the 1640s has been digging pits lined with animal skins, bird carcasses and feathers as recently as the 1970s as part of a fertility ritual, it was revealed today. Archaeologist Jacqui Wood has discovered dozens of shallow rectangular holes near the hamlet of Saveock near Truro since 2003. Locals believe that two spinsters from the village, who died in the 1980s, were members of a coven of local witches who may have links to the pits and passed on their secrets. The freshest hole contains animal bones wrapped in a synthetic twine only used in Cornwall since the 1970s, which means the witch or witches who dug it are very likely to be alive, she says. Dr Wood's theory is that generations of local women have slaughtered and skinned animals and birds to help them fall pregnant. The earliest witch pit dates back to the 1640s and is lined with a slaughtered swan turned inside-out, claws from other birds and a small pile of stones. In ancient folklore the swan is a symbol of fertility and new life. Others were lined with the skins of animals like cats and dogs, and many have large numbers of birds eggs buried as the chicks were about to hatch. Remarkably the pits often contain a pile of pebbles only found at Swanpool beach near Falmouth, which is 15 miles away from Saveock. Dr Wood believes that the pits may be an offering to St Brigid of Kildare in Ireland, the patron saint of newborn babies, dug by women who were struggling to get pregnant. Other theories involve witches who wanted to marry and have children. She told MailOnline: 'It is a faith system dating back at least 350 years and I believe it is linked to witchcraft. It is all still a secret, probably passed down from mother to daughter. Grim: The pits contain animal carcasses or in this case the wing of a swan and a set of egg. Swans are linked to folklore as symbols of rejuvenation and fertility. Symbols: Many of the holes contain eggs from a variety of birds all with chicks that were about the hatch while others contain the skins of animals and birds feathers, right. 'We know that one pit must have been dug in the 1970s. It contained orange baler twine invented in the 1960s and we know this was not used in Cornwall until the 1970s. Carbon dating of another pit shows that it was dug after the 1950s. 'There is an unbroken line from the 1640s to today. I think the people doing it now must still be alive. 'What's amazing is that these people must believe it works otherwise they would not still be doing it. And it is still being kept a secret after all these years. 'My own theory is that maybe if you got married and did not get pregnant in the first year, you might make an offering to St Bride of a feather pit. If you finally got pregnant you had to go back to the pit and take out the contents and burn them and set the spirit of the swan free. If you never got pregnant then the pit remained untouched'. The 40-or-so pits have been found by Dr Wood and her students in areas where there were reeds. The first one was found by accident in 2003 during the excavation of a neolithic platform. Theory: The tiny hamlet of Saveock, pictured, is near Truro and locals claim two spinsters who died in the 1980s were witches who may have links to the holes and passed the secrets on. At first they believed the hole was a failed attempt to plant a tree but then more digging found several more all roughly measuring 42cm long by 35cm wide and 17cm deep. Dr Wood believes because the land used is often wet it has helped people dig the holes quickly and hide the reeds allowed them to hide the pits easily. 'Every pit is very different but also remarkably similar. It is always involving fur and feather and often birds eggs where the chicks were ready to be born. There is also a small pile of stones, taken from by the sea 15 miles away', she said. Some have contained bones and the heads of goats or pigs. One had a scrap of newspaper containing the word Mussolini, who rose to power in the 1920s and was executed in 1945. The people who dug the pits would also have known they were breaking the law. The killing of swans has been illegal since the 11th century and witchcraft laws were only scrapped in 1951. Dr Wood said: 'We finally got a radio carbon date for one of the pits which was around 1640’s. That was the time of the Civil War and a dangerous thing to be doing when Cromwell’s army came to Cornwall as any sort of pagan worship was classed as witchcraft and punishable by death'. For centuries paganism and witchcraft was part of everyday life in Cornwall and peaked in the 19th century. The majority of communities had their own white witch who was seen as a form of public servant. These witches, also known as pellars, would protect families, get rid of curses and also cure illnesses. Commonly they would also bury offerings on behalf of people, like the pits found in Saveock. The most famous of these was Tamsin Blight, right, who lived from 1798 to 1856 in West Cornwall, and was known to have extraordinary powers to heal sick humans and animals. It was said that she once went to a graveyard and raised the spirit of a recently deceased woman for a male relative who wanted to know about his inheritance. The folk tale known as the 'The Ghost of Stythians' says she used a charmed ring and chanted incantations for some time before people heard a great crashing noise, screams of pain and felt a gust of wind before the woman's spirit rose from the grave and was questioned. One of Cornwall's main tourist attractions is the Museum of Witchcraft in Boscastle, which contains tales of witchcraft and artefacts. Its website sets out various spells and rituals that were used in the county and explained in stories and poems. One called the 'the hand of a suicide' explains how some believed the sick could be cured if they put their hands on the body of a man who had killed themselves. Others believed that touching the body of a person who was recently hanged had the same effect. Another ritual commonly used would involve someone who was ill walking over burning wood from a fire to cure terminal illnesses. One tradition involved the burning of ivy leaves or rushes to find out the future. A couple who wanted to know if they would marry would throw rushes on the fire. If the rushes burned together they would have a happy marriage, but if they split then that would be their fate,. Others used two ivy leaves, burying then in ashes, and used the number of cracks that appeared in woman's leaf to predict how many children they would have. The one that burned the longest would live the longest. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"An archaeologist named Dr. Jacqui Wood found many strange holes, called witch pits, near a small village called Saveock.

Dr. Wood found that the pits are very old, some dating back to the 1640s, but some were made more recently, even in the 1970s. This means that the people who made them might still be alive.

A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the settlement where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts. Snake is a colorful character who claims that the story of the \\"silver saddle\\" and the boy who avenged his father's death is well known and that he wishes to join Blood in his travels. On the way, Snake often scavenges the remains of those killed in gunfights by Roy Blood. Their arrival in Cerriotts is noticed by several townspeople, in particular, a local cowboy known as Turner (Gianni De Luigi). Blood visits the town whorehouse where he meets with an old girlfriend, Shiba (Licinia Lentini), who is also its madam. She tells Blood that she is being extorted by a man called Shep who collects the money on behalf of a Mexican bandit named Garrincha (Aldo Sambrell). Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight. Afterwards, Turner appears to offer Blood 2,000 to kill a man called Barrett. Blood is hesitant to take the murder contract, but accepts the offer upon recognizing the name of the land baron who had swindled his father years before.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” I am facing a new situation today: Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. Tim has a device which lets him see what the average kinetic energy is of the particles in each pot is. After examining each pot, Tim discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, and pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which pot is closer to boiling? The answer is:","completion":"Pot A is closer to boiling. Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the background article From the background article, we learn that the particles of a substance with higher average kinetic energy have a higher temperature. Step 2: Apply the information to the new situation In the new situation, Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. He discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, while pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy. Step 3: Analyze the situation and draw a conclusion Since boiling refers to the point where the temperature is high enough for the liquid to turn into vapor, we can compare the average kinetic energy of particles in both pots to determine which one is closer to boiling. As per the information provided, pot A has a higher average kinetic energy, which means its particles have a higher temperature compared to pot B. Therefore, pot A is closer to boiling than pot B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

It was difficult for Cynthia to hold back her laughter, but she understood that her mother-in-law, Marjorie, took these situations quite seriously. Katrina, being the doting and caring mother, knew exactly how to balance between ensuring safety and fostering an environment where their baby could learn and grow. The baby, only being 10 months old, was now attempting to take more steps forward. Despite tripping a few times, he would always get back up with determination and curiosity in his eyes. It was a heartwarming sight for Cynthia and Katrina, who saw it as a symbol of their baby's resilience and eagerness to explore the world. Marjorie, the experienced grandmother, had raised four children herself and had seen it all. She was well aware of the potential dangers lurking in the household, and whenever a minor accident occurred, she felt it her duty to remain watchful and ensure the well-being of her grandchild. Sitting next to Marjorie, Cynthia couldn't help but exchange a knowing smile with Katrina. She admired her wife's patience, understanding, and unwavering support. They had been through many challenges as a couple, and becoming parents was a new and exciting chapter in their lives. As the baby stumbled and giggled, navigating the obstacles of the baby-proofed living room, the household's attention was drawn to him. Marjorie, although concerned, managed to find joy in the baby's antics and soon, they were all laughing together. The air of tension within the room dissipated and soon, there was nothing but happiness and warmth as they cheered on their little explorer. Cynthia and Katrina took this opportunity to ask Marjorie for her advice on raising children, knowing that her wisdom and guidance would be an invaluable resource in their journey as parents.

The day had unexpectedly turned into a bonding experience for all three generations, with the baby continuing to amuse and charm them while they shared stories, laughter, and love. Cynthia, Katrina, and Marjorie knew that the journey ahead would bring its own set of challenges, but they felt confident and united as a family navigating this new phase in their lives. Throughout the evening, they continued their heartfelt conversations, trading anecdotes and ideas to help Cynthia and Katrina become the best parents they could be. And, in the background of that loving, supportive environment, the baby continued his shaky attempts at walking – taking slow, steady steps into the beautiful unknown, secure in the knowledge that his mothers and grandmother would guide and catch him, no matter where life's journey would lead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which of the following people did not praise Burke: Gladstone, Cobden or Milton? Context: The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\". Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a manifesto for Conservative thinking. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Milton. Step-by-step justification: 1. The context mentions that Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America,\\" which indicates that Gladstone praised Burke. 2. The context also mentions that Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity, which implies that Cobden praised Burke. 3. Milton is not mentioned in the context as praising Burke. However, Lord Macaulay is quoted as saying, \\"The greatest man since Milton,\\" indicating that Milton is not included in the list of people who praised Burke. 4.

Movie plot title: Evil Dead II Movie plot: The film begins with a simplified recap of the events of the first film. Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him. At first, he is mistaken for a murderer by the four people because he shoots at them through the door (mistaking them as the Evil Force), but they find out the truth after listening to a recording of Annie's father, Professor Knowby, that talked about how his wife Henrietta...

Why do they not have a laminator ?","completion":"Based on the provided article, it is not explicitly stated why the individual does not have a laminator. However, we can infer several possible reasons that may explain the absence of a laminator in their possession: 1. Cost: One primary reason could be the cost of purchasing a laminator. Laminators, especially high-quality ones, can be expensive, and the individual might not have the budget to invest in one. As they mentioned charging 5 for their work, they might be starting their business on a limited budget, making the purchase of a laminator unaffordable at the moment. 2. Prioritization: Even if the individual has a budget for their business, they might have chosen to prioritize other equipment or resources. They mentioned that they are \\"mainly going to do badges,\\" which could suggest that they have invested in other tools or materials required for creating badges. The decision not to buy a laminator could have been a strategic choice based on their business priorities and available resources. 3. Limited Use: A laminator might not be deemed necessary for the individual's work at this time. If the focus is primarily on making badges, lamination may not be seen as a crucial step in the process. This could also mean that the individual has weighed the benefits of laminating their work against the cost of purchasing a laminator and determined that it is not worth it at this stage. 4. Lack of Knowledge: It is also possible that the individual is unaware of the potential benefits of lamination or is unsure how to go about purchasing and using a laminator. In this case, they may have decided not to make any investment in a laminator simply because they do not recognize its value. 5. Future considerations: The individual might be considering purchasing a laminator in the future as their business grows or when they have enough funds. They might want to see how their work is received and whether there is a demand for laminated badges before committing to the investment. In summary, although it is not explicitly mentioned why this individual does not have a laminator, potential reasons could include cost, prioritization of resources, limited use for their business, lack of knowledge about laminators, or plans to consider purchasing one in the future when their business expands or when they have more funds available."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Kendall was a dog trainer and taught Alex's dog to sit.

You don’t have to share anything you don’t want to. People who are nosy don’t necessarily need to know what’s going on in your life. It’s perfectly fine to pretend that you’re doing great. For example, if you go to family gatherings and get pestered by older family members, say things are great, even if they’re not. Even if you’re sad about things, pretend like life is going okay and don’t say much beyond that. If someone is talking about something you’re uncomfortable with, change the topic of conversation. Excuse yourself for a moment and come back in a bit. Shift the subject of the conversation away to something else without feeling too abrupt. If someone asks how you’re doing and you’re not prepared to say how you really feel, shift the subject by saying, “I’m really happy to see that the sun is out today.” If someone asks, “How are you and your spouse?” and you’d rather not talk about your marital difficulties, change the subject. Say, “We’re doing fine. Did I tell you about my son’s recent karate match?” Avoid saying too much or getting into detailed stories. The point is to say as little as possible and perhaps even duck out of the conversation. This will help to shut down the conversation or move on to another topic to talk about.

Spain, Germany, France, even Italy, have taken over as the destinations of choice for the world class footballer. Jose Mourinho was proved right after the World Cup with some brilliant business.","completion":"Title: The Fading Supremacy of the English Premier League: A New Reality Awakens Introduction The English Premier League has long been acclaimed as the best football league in the world. The unpredictability, passion, and frenzied matches have seen the league dominate both on and off the field. Nonetheless, recent developments tell a different tale as the lure of other European leagues and the inconsistencies of native talents question the league's supremacy and global status. Steven Gerrard, Liverpool Legend Shatters the Myth A recent glaring example of this can be found in the words of Steven Gerrard, the legendary Liverpool captain, who single-handedly exposed the delusional notion of the Premier League's global supremacy. In a conversation with former teammate Luis Suarez, Gerrard exclaimed that the Uruguayan striker was 'too good' to join Arsenal, an English Premier League team. Gerrard's sentiments reflect a broader issue within the league, whose competition and standards have been increasingly questioned. The Musical Chairs of Native English Footballers When it comes to nurturing homegrown talents, many have criticized the Premier League for not elevating their potential. Indeed, the league has witnessed an all too familiar shuffle of local footballers among their own teams. The likes of Jack Wilshere, Adam Lallana, Danny Welbeck, and Jordan Henderson, although touted as future stars, have somewhat underperformed at both club and national levels. Their mediocre performance in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil is a testament to this argument. Once considered indispensable figures in their respective clubs, these English youngsters have failed to match the meteoric rise of their European counterparts. The decline in their performance highlights a crucial problem with the Premier League, given the hefty investments made in the development and progression of these promising talents. Europe Rises: The Direct Flight to Spain, Germany, France, and Italy In sharp contrast to the Premier League's slump, football powerhouses such as Spain, Germany, France, and Italy have emerged as the ultimate destinations for world-class players. Boasting competitive and tactical leagues, these countries have successfully retained and further augmented their squad of exceptional players. Europe's best talents now flock to these leagues to ply their trade, leaving the once-coveted Premier League behind in the race for global football supremacy. Jose Mourinho and the Battle of European Perception The shrewd eye of José Mourinho, the former Chelsea manager, captured the Premier League's imminent decline in his post-World Cup statements. Mourinho cleverly recognized that the league needed to refocus their priorities on developing fresh talent and purchased brilliant European assets like Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa. The celebrated manager correctly identified that the Premier League had to alter their approach and invest in players who could challenge for the top spots on the global stage. Conclusion The fading supremacy of the English Premier League presents significant questions about its shifting status in the world of football. With other European leagues strengthening their position as preferred destinations for top-tier players and native English footballers underachieving, the Premier League's illusion of grandeur has come under significant scrutiny. The league must learn from its continental counterparts, like Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, to rekindle its erstwhile dominance and reshape its perception as the world's greatest football competition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Last year, on the night before the first day of the Spring Festival, Hugo Pang was sitting in his huge flat on Hong Kong Island. It was late in the evening, and Hugo was sipping a glass of his favorite French brandy, and listening to music on his huge, expensive music center. Pang lived alone, apart from the six maid who cooked and cleaned for him, and the chauffeur who drove his Rolls-Royce. Suddenly, the room seemed to begin spinning around him. Then there was a flash of light and a puff of smoke, and before him Pang saw an old man dressed in traditional Chinese clothes. Pang looked at his brandy glass, and looked again at the old man. He was so frightened he couldn't speak. \\"Come with me,\\" said the old man, \\"I'm going to show you something.\\" He took Pang's hand, and immediately the room disappeared, and Pang was standing in a field outside a village in Guangdong Province. The houses were small and the village was poor, but in front of him Pang saw a little crowd of children were playing. It was Spring Festival, and the sound of firecrackers could be heard from inside the village, while smoke rose over the roofs of the houses.

Here is a goal: How can you survive an encounter with a Wild Mountain Lion? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To survive an encounter with a wild mountain lion, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Stay calm and assess Justify: When encountering a mountain lion, it is crucial to remain calm and assess the situation. Panicking may lead the mountain lion to view you as prey. Step 2: Make yourself appear larger Justify: Mountain lions are less likely to attack if they perceive you as a potential threat rather than easy prey. Making yourself appear larger by raising your arms or standing on your tiptoes can help deter the animal. Step 3: Maintain eye contact Justify: Keeping eye contact with the mountain lion asserts dominance and shows the animal that you are aware of its presence, potentially preventing it from taking a more offensive approach. Step 4: Make loud noises Justify: Making noise can help intimidate the mountain lion, as it may startle them or make them think twice about approaching you. Shouting, clapping, or yelling can be effective. Step 5: Slowly back away Justify: Slowly backing away without turning your back to the mountain lion allows you to maintain eye contact and continue to assert your dominance while creating more distance between you and the animal. Step 6: Do not run Justify: Running may trigger the mountain lion's predatory instincts and provoke an attack. It is best to back away slowly and steadily, as mentioned in step 5. Step 7: If attacked, fight back Justify: If the mountain lion does initiate an attack, it is crucial to fight back with whatever tools or weapons you have available. Striking the animal's face, eyes, and nose can help increase your chances of surviving the encounter. These steps provide a strategy for survivng an encounter with a wild mountain lion, using a combination of psychological and physical deterrence tactics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose the marinade: Select a sauce or marinade that you would like to flavor your salmon with, such as a combination of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs. This will ensure the salmon is flavorful and moist when it's baked. 2. Prepare the plastic bag: Get a large Ziploc or resealable plastic bag, which will be used to hold the salmon fillets and marinade. Using a plastic bag makes it easier to ensure an even coating of the marinade on the fillets and allows for easy clean-up afterwards. 3. Place the salmon fillets in the bag: Put the salmon fillets into the plastic bag. Ensure that they are properly arranged and not overlapping, so they marinate evenly and efficiently. 4. Add the marinade: Pour the sauce or marinade you have chosen into the plastic bag with the salmon fillets. Now, for the best option between the provided answers, we have: Option 1: Seal the bag, turn it over to coat both sides, then place in fridge for at least 2 hours. Option 2: Cut the bag, turn it over to coat both sides, then place in fridge for at least 2 hours. To proceed, you'd want to choose option 1, as cutting the bag in option 2 could create a mess from leaking marinade: 5. Seal the bag: Close the plastic bag, taking care to remove any excess air. Doing this prevents the marinade from leaking out and enhances the contact between the fillets and the marinade. 6. Coat both sides of the fillets: Gently turn the plastic bag over several times to ensure the marinade coats both sides of the salmon fillets evenly. 7. Marinate the salmon: Place the bag with the salmon fillets in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Marinating the salmon for this amount of time will allow the flavors from the marinade to penetrate the fish, resulting in a more flavorful dish. 8. Bake the salmon: After marinating, remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature for about 10-15 minutes. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C), place the salmon on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for 12-15 minutes or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork.

Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) and another man are quickly arrested, and are later sentenced to serve 99 years' imprisonment each for the killing. Eleven years later, Wiecek's mother (Kasia Orzazewski) puts an ad in the newspaper offering a 5,000 reward for information about the true killers of the police officer.

This is quickly followed by political pressure from the state capital, where politicians are anxious to end a story that might prove embarrassing to the administration.

Question: I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Now, I have a new situation: John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Answer this question please: Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Answer:","completion":"Test C saw higher concentrations of the products.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3] and the situation: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.

The","completion":"reason was multifaceted, stemming from a combination of procrastination, lack of concentration, and inadequate planning on his part. Moreover, the subject matter of his homework appeared to be more challenging than he initially anticipated, leading to increased frustration and anxiety. To begin with, James had a tendency to procrastinate when faced with tasks that he deemed tedious or difficult. This bad habit often led him to postpone important assignments until the very last minute, resulting in subpar quality and limited time for completion. In this specific instance, James wasted precious minutes scrolling through social media and engaging in other distractions, significantly reducing the time available for him to concentrate on his homework. Additionally, James struggled with maintaining his focus and concentration on the task at hand. His mind frequently wandered to unrelated thoughts, making it challenging for him to fully grasp and apply the concepts he was learning. Moreover, his immediate environment did not facilitate productivity, as it was filled with distractions such as his phone, video games, and even loud noises from outside his window. These factors greatly impeded his ability to work efficiently and make the most of the limited time that his mom was away. Another contributing factor to James's predicament was his inadequate planning and organization skills. Instead of breaking down the assignment into smaller, more manageable tasks and setting clear goals, he approached it haphazardly, attempting to tackle multiple questions simultaneously without a clear plan. Consequently, this approach resulted in considerable confusion and disorganization, which further added to his sense of being overwhelmed and slowed down his progress. Lastly, the subject matter of James's homework itself presented a significant challenge. He was confronted with concepts that were either completely new or that he had not grasped fully in class, resulting in confusion and frustration. As an added stressor, he could not seek immediate assistance from his mom since she was outside, which intensified his feelings of anxiety and helplessness. In conclusion, James's inability to complete his homework within the time frame that his mom was outside resulted from a combination of his procrastination, lack of concentration, poor planning and organization skills, and difficulty understanding the subject matter. In order to overcome these challenges, James must work on improving his time management skills, developing strategies to maintain focus, and seeking assistance when confronted with difficult concepts. By addressing these areas of personal growth, James will be better equipped to successfully complete his homework within the allotted time, avoiding last-minute stress and frustration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Then Streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this one even existed. You play as ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X. Beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river. You even have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr. X, but never mind. Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes. As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.

I read this background article the other day: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. I am facing a new situation today: Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation due to the materials used in the rides. Robert visits the Ferris wheel and his Geiger counter clicks slowly. Thomas visits the merry go round and his Geiger counter begins to click rapidly. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person's Geiger count has less current running through it? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question correctly, we should evaluate the information given in both the background article and the situation involving Robert and Thomas. Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. From the background article, we learn that a Geiger counter detects radiation through a tube which contains gas atoms. When radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms into ions that carry electric current. The current then causes the Geiger counter to click. 2. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation (and hence, the higher the electric current). 3. In the new situation, Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly at the Ferris wheel, while Thomas' Geiger counter clicks rapidly at the merry-go-round. 4. Based on the information from the background article, we can infer that the higher the click rate, the higher the electric current running through the Geiger counter. 5. Since Thomas' Geiger counter clicks more rapidly, it indicates a higher level of radiation and thus a higher electric current. Therefore, the correct answer is that Robert's Geiger count has less current running through it compared to Thomas' Geiger count."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

First write out the pH equation. Next, identify the values you have by writing them directly below your equation. For example, if you know the pH is a value of 10.1, write it on the paper below the pH equation. Rearranging the equation will require a strong understanding of algebra. To calculate concentration from pH, you must understand that the inverse of log10 is \\"10 to the power of ...\\" Start by shifting the minus sign over from the log side to the pH side. Then raise 10 to the power of (each side). \\"10 to the power of\\" and log10 are inverses of each other and cancels out. For example, pH = -log10[H3O+] will mold into [H3O+] = 10-pH. pH can then be filled in as 10.1 When working with inverse log, the calculator process is unique. Remember that log is a type of multiplication by 10. To enter your equation, key in 10. Next, hit the “EXP” exponent button. Key in the negative sign followed by the value. Hit solve. For example, take a pH value of 10.1. Key in “10” followed by “EXP.” Now key in “-/+” to have our value be negative. Finally, key in the pH of “10.1”. Hit solve. You should get about 7.943ᴇ-11, or 7.943*10-11. This means our concentration is 7.943*10-11 M. A neutral pH of 7 equates to a hydronium ion concentration of 10-7 M. A solution with a pH of 10.1 is basic, so it will have less hydronium ions than that. If we look at our answer, 7.943*10-11, we do indeed see that this number is way smaller than 10-7, so our answer does make sense.","completion":"To calculate concentration from pH, rearrange the pH equation using algebra, apply the inverse log function and input the known pH value into a calculator; a pH of 10.1 corresponds to a hydronium ion concentration of approximately 7.943*10^-11 M, indicating a basic solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The New York Times But for families across the country that have cut back spending, a 17.3 percent jump in gasoline prices in June further pinched pocketbooks. A retail sales report on Tuesday said that clothing and food spending stayed mostly flat last month. Minutes from the June 23-24 meeting of Federal Reserve officials, released Wednesday, also showed that policy makers were concerned about the short-lived impact of the 787 billion federal stimulus package and feared that consumer spending would continue to decline. Families are also saving more of their income in uncertain times and thwarting efforts at consumer stimulus. The officials projected that unemployment would reach 10 percent by the end of 2010 and would remain high for several years. The gross domestic product for 2009 is also expected to shrink by up to 1.5 percent. At the least, the price data soothed worries that the economy might be slipping into a deflationary trap — when unemployment, wages, aggregate demand and shelf prices spiral downward — such as what happened to Japan during its “lost decade” after an asset bubble collapse in the early 1990s. Mr. Levy, the Bank of America economist, said that prices had held up surprisingly well despite the severity and length of the recession. “I expect core C.P.I. to drift lower but not outright decline,” he said. Compared with a year ago, the Consumer Price Index has fallen 1.4 percent, the steepest decline since 1950, as the prolonged downturn takes its toll on demand in the economy. A report on Tuesday said that the Producer Price Index, a measure of prices at the wholesale level, surged 1.8 percent in June, as manufacturers also feel squeezed by higher energy costs. Since hitting a high this year of 72.68 a barrel on June 11, crude oil prices have held steady around 60 a barrel so far this month. Economists expect gas prices to ease. The Labor Department said that energy prices in general rose 7.6 percent in June. The average cost of gasoline in June was 2.63 a gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Sorry!","completion":"The following review contains both positive and negative comments. On the positive side, the reviewer mentions that the kool-aid served at the establishment tastes great, and commends the staff for being very nice. These aspects indicate that the reviewer appreciates the quality of the beverage offered and the pleasant nature of the staff members present at the venue. However, the review also highlights several negative points, which seem to outweigh the positive aspects. Firstly, the slow service when seated outside is mentioned, which indicates customer dissatisfaction with the efficiency of the wait staff in that particular area. Secondly, the cornbread is not recommended because it is described as dense and hard instead of soft and buttery as the reviewer might have expected. Lastly, the reviewer compares the establishment's chicken and waffles to KFC chicken with Ego waffles, suggesting that the dish is not as unique or high-quality as the reviewer would prefer. The suggestion to spend money on a bucket of fried chicken elsewhere implies that the reviewer feels the price paid for the dish in this establishment is not worth the taste and quality offered.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: John is preparing for a do it yourself science project. First, he made a circuit with adequate resistance. He labeled that state of the circuit as circuit A. Then he lowered the resistance. He called that new state of the circuit as circuit B. While he was doing all this, his friend Keith showed up with another circuit, circuit C. But that circuit's insulation was damaged. and a hint : For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. Please answer this question : Which circuit would have higher temperature, circuit A or circuit B? Answer:","completion":"Circuit B would have a higher temperature. This is because when the resistance is lowered in circuit B, a larger amount of current will flow through the circuit. This increased current can cause the wires to overheat, leading to a higher temperature in circuit B compared to circuit A, which has adequate resistance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Identify the negative aspects of the review - The reviewer had a negative experience with an employee named Kiara. Kiara's lack of helpfulness and inability to troubleshoot the issue with the phone led to the reviewer leaving frustrated and without making a purchase. Step 3: Identify if a negative experience was resolved - The reviewer went to another location to resolve the issue and was able to purchase a new phone with an upgrade. This shows that the negative experience was not resolved at the original location but rather at a different one. Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment of the review - The overall sentiment of the review is negative due to the bad experience with the employee and the loss of a sale.

The lack of a legal aid presence in Pomona prompted the bar association and court officials to start their own once-monthly family law clinic. After learning of the effort, Dudovitz sent personnel to staff the clinic for three hours per week and is helping to write a grant application to fund a self-help kiosk for Pomona patterned on the center he pioneered in Van Nuys.

This method is slower than touch typing, where all fingers are utilized, and typists have a general knowledge of the keyboard layout. Step 3: Explain the metaphorical connection The term 'Hunt-and-Peck' is a metaphor for this typing method because it resembles the actions of a bird pecking at food. Just as a bird hunts for food and pecks at it using its beak, a 'Hunt-and-Peck' typist searches for each key on the keyboard and presses it with a single finger.

An abandoned subway terminal in New York City is being pitched for redevelopment into a sunlit, subterranean park -- replete with 60,000 square feet of flowers, ponds and trees. Located in Manhattan's trendy Lower East Side, the vast underground space -- which is about the size of a football field -- has remained untouched since the terminal was discontinued back in 1948. Now, a group of entrepreneurs are proposing an elaborate green makeover, in which sunlight would be \\"harvested\\" above ground and channeled into the vaults below via a network of fiber-optic cables -- creating an environment apparently filled with natural light and, in theory, ripe for growing all the foliage of a typical city park. \\"Effectively, we'd gather an image of the sky and sun at street level and distribute it underground,\\" said James Ramsey, former NASA satellite engineer-turned-architect and the brains behind the idea. Ramsey began developing the Delancey Underground project (named after the old New York street under which the park is planned) after persuading the local transport authorities to give him, and co-founder Dan Barasch, a guided tour of its derelict carriage terminal. \\"Sixty years of accumulated filth aside, I was struck by the beautiful historic qualities of the space -- with its cobblestone floors, original footway tiles and high-vaulted arched ceiling,\\" recalled Ramsey. \\"These are all features we'd love to see carried through, but with the futuristic addition of a fully functioning community park.\\" Read related: Could 'Earthscraper' really turn architecture on its head? Ramsey and Barasch's romantic vision includes a polished, undulating ceiling plane from which the \\"remote skylights\\" -- developed by Ramsay to filter out harmful ultraviolet and infrared light frequencies -- will flood the park with sunrays all year-round, night and day. According to Ramsey, the technology is \\"like a cross between a telescope and an endoscope\\" -- capturing light from the sun and then transporting it through fiber-optic cables onto a relatively small focal point. \\"Of course the lighting will be supplemented with an electric supply at night and during cloudy periods ... and we'll also need additional energy for a ventilation system,\\" said Ramsey. \\"But for both cost and environmental purposes, any additional energy use will be as green and efficient as possible,\\" he added. Comment: Would you give them your support? Is the \\"Delancey Underground\\" project a feasible and much needed innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream? Tell us you thoughts in the comments section below. Despite the possibility of this additional energy consumption, Barasch -- who also works for an NGO promoting socially innovative applications of technology -- is resolute about the park's eco-credentials. \\"This will be a distinctive testament to the varied applications and incredible promise of solar power,\\" he said. \\"It would also bring a slice of nature into one of New York's least green areas, and encourage people to think about their relationship with the environment.\\" The plans have drawn comparisons with the popular High Line -- another park built along an old railway way line -- in this case high above the city streets in New York's Lower West Side. \\"Rather than demolish what was there and replace it with shiny new office blocks or expensive apartments, the existing structure has been re-imagined to become a sustainable space for everyone to enjoy ... and we have very similar aims in that respect,\\" said Ramsey. The terminal is currently under the control of the transport authority, and they have agreed to listen to the duo's pitch -- but made it clear they will not submit any funding for the construction of the park. \\"In the end, we will have to compete with other proposals, which will no doubt offer compelling commercial arguments for things like a car-parking lot or shopping mall,\\" said Ramsey, who plans to finance the entire initiative through private funding and donations. The duo say it's too early to put a price on how much the park will cost to build and run, but they are currently in the process of raising 400,000 for a full-scale demonstration of the \\"skylight\\" technology and a thorough feasibility study regarding the structural and ventilation conditions of the terminal.

Please answer the following question: This article: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success.

His empire includes a range of financial, political, and criminal operations. The nearby city of Springfort, however, is a thorn in his side, home to a rival gang: The Crimson Syndicate. After a series of skirmishes with The Crimson Syndicate, Pa Danby decides that he has had enough - it is time to launch an all-out assault to take over Springfort. But, to ensure victory, he believes that he needs the help of his most trusted army - his extended family. The movie introduces the audience to Pa Danby's eclectic family, consisting of aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws, and distant relatives, each possessing unique skills and eccentric personalities. Among them are Amelia, an expert safecracker; Cousin Eddie, an illegal arms dealer; Aunt Gertrude, a surprisingly skilled computer hacker; and twins Orlando and Owen, daredevil getaway drivers. Act 2: Planning the Assault The Danby family gathers at Pa Danby's countryside mansion to discuss the plan and prepare for the biggest heist of their lives. Several mini-skirmishes break out as personalities clash, but beneath it all, there is a reluctant respect and loyalty for the family patriarch. Pa Danby's sons, Carter and Stanley, are a constant driving force, pushing everyone to their limits. As the family plans the elaborate assault on Springfort, they realize they must gain control of the city's key infrastructure (local media, law enforcement, and political offices) to effectively dismantle The Crimson Syndicate. Doing so will force the rival gang's leader, Victor Morozov, and his right-hand man, Koslov, into a final confrontation. Act 3: Executing the Plan Pa Danby's army springs into action, with each family member taking on a critical role in the highly synchronized assault. One by one, they manage to take control of key locations and shut down The Crimson Syndicate's operations throughout the city. The Crimson Syndicate is completely caught off-guard by this random assortment of relatives. However, as the Danby family gets closer to completing their takeover, they find that Morozov has devious countermeasures in place. This forces the Danby family to think quickly and adapt their plans as they go. Morozov kidnaps Carter's wife, Sarah, to bargain his escape. Carter, realizing his love for his family is stronger than his loyalty to his father, organizes a rescue operation, culminating in a final showdown between the Danby's and Morozov's forces. Act 4: Redemption and Resolution During the final standoff, Pa Danby is grievously injured, leading the Danby family to work together more efficiently than ever before to defeat The Crimson Syndicate. Carter and Morozov fight, with Carter ultimately emerging victorious. However, instead of killing Morozov, he hands him over to the authorities, proving that the Danbys, despite their line of work and criminal activities, are united by an innate sense of loyalty and justice. Pa Danby, recovering in the hospital, reflects on his life and realizes the importance of family unity. He relinquishes control of the criminal empire to Carter and Stanley, who vow to run it with a newfound sense of responsibility and honor. \\"Danby's Unseen Army\\" is a thrilling action-comedy that combines intense action sequences, hilarious character dynamics, and a heartwarming story of family loyalty, trust, and redemption."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: Context: Physical activity is beneficial for cancer survivors, but exercise participation is low in this population. It is therefore important to understand the psychological factors underlying exercise uptake so that more effective interventions can be developed. Social-cognitive theory constructs such as outcome expectancies predict exercise behavior, but self-report measures have several limitations. We examined the associations between implicit (automatic) cognitions and exercise behavior and self-efficacy in endometrial cancer survivors.', 'This was a longitudinal study to examine predictors of exercise behavior in female endometrial cancer survivors who all received an exercise intervention. Participants (N = 100, mean age of 57.0) completed questionnaires to assess self-report exercise-related measures (outcome expectancy and attitudes about and identification with exercise) and reaction time (RT) tasks to assess implicit exercise cognitions (expectancy accessibility, implicit attitudes about exercise, and implicit self-identification with exercise) at baseline and at 2, 4, and 6 months at follow-up. Exercise behavior was measured using accelerometers and self-report. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models.', 'Expectancy accessibility was associated with exercise duration independent of the corresponding self-report measure. Exercise implicit attitudes and self-identification were prospectively associated with exercise self-efficacy only after adjustment for the corresponding self-report measures and baseline self-efficacy. Self-report measures were also associated with study outcomes. Answer: Both self-reported cognitions and implicit cognitions may be useful to identify individuals at risk of failing to exercise. Individuals so identified might be provided with a different or more intensive intervention. The data also suggest cognitive targets for intervention.

Options: [i] yes [ii] it is not possible to tell [iii] no","completion":"[iii] no The premise \\"Yes, lad\\" demonstrates an affirmation or agreement with a statement or claim made previously. In other words, it showcases support and endorsement of the view expressed by someone else. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"No, you're completely wrong on that\\" indicates a direct contradiction to, or disapproval of, the same statement or claim. It highlights the speaker's belief that the individual in question is entirely incorrect in their understanding or judgment of the subject matter.

So a couple of weeks ago I was lucky enough to be invited to The Body Shop® blogger event at my local store in Coppergate, York. It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There’s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just £50 which I thought was a great fun idea.

French and British Ties and Occupation: The daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella married the son and heir of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian of Hapsburg. The Spanish crown duly passed to the Hapsburgs, and Spain remained in their hands until the feeble-minded Carlos II died in 1700, leaving no heir. France seized the chance to install the young grandson of Louis XIV on the Spanish throne. A rival Hapsburg claimant was supported by Austria and Britain, who saw a powerful Spanish-French alliance as a major threat. In the subsequent War of the Spanish Succession (1702 –1713) most of the old kingdom of Aragón, including the Balearics, backed the Hapsburgs. Britain seized Gibraltar — in the name of the Hapsburg claimant — and retained it when the war was over. In 1708 Britain captured Menorca, and the magnificent harbor of Mahón (Maó), for the Royal Navy. England clung to it even when Bourbon forces captured Mallorca at the end of the war. Menorca changed hands between Britain, France, and Spain five more times in less than a century. Britain finally ceded the island to Spain in the year 1802, under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens. By 1805, Spain was once more aligned with France, and Spanish ships fought alongside the French against Nelson at Trafalgar. Napoleon came to distrust his Spanish ally and forcibly replaced the king of Spain with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte. A French army marched in to subdue the country. The Spanish resisted and, aided by British troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, drove the French out. What British historians call the Peninsular War (1808–1814) is known in Spain as the War of Independence. In the 19th century, practically all of Spain’s possessions in the Americas broke away in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, and the few that remained were lost at the end of the 19th century. The Balearics, further neglected, were beset with poverty and outbreaks of disease. However, toward the 20th century, things began to improve on the islands, with Mallorca reaping the rewards of successful agricultural crops and Menorca launching an export shoe industry.

He worked at ground zero for 11 days beside his colleagues -- many of them, including Hilaire, not wearing a mask. He was later assigned to a landfill in Staten Island, where debris from the World Trade Center was dumped. For about 60 days between 2001 and 2002, the New York police officer was surrounded by dust. In 2005, Hilaire was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He underwent surgery and radiation. Just months later his doctor told him he also had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that multiplies the body's plasma cells to dangerous levels. It's a cancer that usually strikes much later in life. Hilaire was 34. More than 1,100 people who worked or lived near the World Trade Center on 9/11 have been diagnosed with cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A few months ago Hilaire received a letter from the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, officially offering him medical insurance under the World Trade Center Health Program. About 1,140 people have been certified to receive cancer treatment under the WTC Health Program, a representative told CNN. These are the first numbers released since the program was expanded a year ago. In September 2012, federal health authorities added 58 types of cancer to the list of covered illnesses for people who were exposed to toxins at the site of the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer choice in the given options is \\"radiator.\\" Radiators are a common component of heating systems in buildings, particularly those that rely on central heating. They serve as a means to transfer heat throughout the building, making the space more comfortable for inhabitants. While it is true that energy is used for heating a building and that oil can be used as the energy source, it is important to distinguish between the source of the energy and the method by which the energy is distributed throughout the building. Radiators provide the means by which the heat generated by the energy source (in this case, oil) is dispersed, making them the most appropriate answer choice. It is worth noting that some of the other answer choices can provide heating or insulation benefits in different contexts. For example, insulation is an important component of a building's construction to improve its energy efficiency by reducing heat loss. Body heat and clothing can provide personal warmth in the absence of a mechanical heating system.

Isolate f: To isolate f, I'll first move the constant term to the other side of the equation. -6*f + 12 - 12 = 0 - 12 This simplifies to: -6*f = -12 Step 3. Solve for f: To find the value of f, I'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of f, which is -6. -6*f / -6 = -12 / -6 This simplifies to: f = 2 So, the solution for the given equation, -226*f + 220*f + 12 = 0, is f = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The French defender's move aims to bolster the strength of Marseille's defense while also providing Amavi new challenges and growth opportunities to prove his worth at a higher level. Step 1: Introducing Jordan Amavi Jordan Amavi, a talented 27-year-old French left-back, first caught attention with his performances for OGC Nice before making a move to English side Aston Villa in 2015. Despite showing glimpses of his potential, Amavi struggled with injuries during his time at Villa Park, which hampered his growth as a player. Eager to prove himself, Amavi's move to Marseille offers him a fresh start and a chance to rediscover the form that brought him prominence. Step 2: Providing context for the transfer As Aston Villa continues its rebuilding process after a string of disappointing seasons, the sale of Amavi was seen as a practical move for the club. The funds generated from the potential permanent transfer could be used to strengthen other areas, while clearing the path for younger talent to come through the ranks. Marseille, conversely, sought to bolster its defensive options, and Amavi's acquisition provides depth and competition in the left-back position. With his knowledge of Ligue 1 after playing for Nice, Amavi brings valuable experience and a familiar style of play to the table which will ease his adaptation. Step 3: Discussing the terms of the loan and permanent deal The loan agreement between Aston Villa and Marseille includes an option for the French giants to turn the move into a permanent one at the end of the season. Should Amavi impress during his stint, Marseille will likely pursue a full transfer, enabling Aston Villa to cash in on the player and Marseille to invest in a long-term defensive solution. Step 4: Analyzing the impact on both clubs Aston Villa's decision to loan out Amavi will open the door for younger players to make a case for the first-team left-back spot. The potential permanent sale could also provide the club with much-needed funds to reinvest into the squad, assisting in their quest for promotion back to the Premier League. For Marseille, the addition of Amavi elevates their selection choices and adds a dynamic, attack-minded option on the left flank. By showcasing his skillset in France and beyond, the move has the potential to be a significant win for both the player and the club. Conclusion: Jordan Amavi's loan move to Marseille highlights an exciting new chapter for both Aston Villa and the French defender. With promising prospects for each party in turning the loan into a permanent transfer, the footballing world is eager to see if Amavi can seize this new opportunity and make a substantial impact in Ligue 1, paving the way for a long and prosperous career with Marseille."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - \`\` Before Tomorrow Comes '' is a song by American hard rock band Alter Bridge and the third international , fourth overall , and final single taken from the band 's second album Blackbird .

Pure iron is relatively soft, but when combined with a small amount of carbon to produce steel, it becomes much harder."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Rolling Stones Records was the record label formed by the Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman in 1970, after their recording contract with Decca Records expired. It was first distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco Records. Beginning in 1973 it signed a distribution deal with Atlantic Records. In 1986 Columbia Records started distributing it. In the UK, it was distributed by EMI. The label was initially headed by Marshall Chess, the son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. It was discontinued in 1992 when the band signed to Virgin Records, but the tongue-and-lips logo remains on all post-1970 Rolling Stones releases. - \`\` Some Girls '' is the title track of English rock and roll band the Rolling Stone 's 1978 album Some Girls . It marked the third time a song on one of the band 's albums also served as the album 's title and is noted for its risque lyrics concerning the title 's \`\` some girls '' . Alongside previous Stones releases that courted controversy ( \`\` Under My Thumb '' , \`\` Brown Sugar '' , \`\` Star Star '' ) due to their apparently degrading lyrics towards women , \`\` Some Girls '' caused a ruckus among both feminists and civil rights activists over such lyrics as \`\` black girls just want to get fucked all night '' and \`\` Chinese girls are so gentle / They 're really such a tease '' . Mick Jagger and the band defended the song , saying the lyrics mocked actual stereotypical feelings towards women . Saturday Night Live cast member Garrett Morris commented on the controversy with a mock - editorial on the show 's Weekend Update segment : After giving the impression that he was going to openly criticize the Stones , he quoted a sanitized version of the \`\` Black girls just ... '' line , then stated \`\` I have one thing to say to you , Mr. Mick Jagger ... where are these women ? ! ? '' The song is demonstrative of the unconventional uses of steel guitars heard throughout the Some Girls album , with an unusual , droning , phased two - chord groove that 's among the Stones ' most unusual arrangements . The original cut of the song ran some 23 minutes and featured verses Jagger came up with as they went along . Harmonica player Sugar Blue provides some virtuosic blues - style solos on the track . The song was featured heavily on the Stones ' 1999 North American No Security Tour which concentrated on lesser - known songs from the band 's catalogue . A performance during the band 's 2006 leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour was captured for the 2008 live album Shine a Light . - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (lead guitar, backing vocals), Ian Stewart (piano), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Other touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (196782), Billy Preston (through the mid 1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982-present). The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles. - Some Girls is the 14th British and 16th American studio album by the Rolling Stones, released in 1978 on Rolling Stones Records. It reached number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200 album chart, and became the band's top selling album in the United States, certified by the RIAA as having six million copies sold as of 2000. It was a major critical success, becoming the only Rolling Stones album to be nominated for a Grammy in the Album of the Year category. Many reviewers called it a classic return to form and their best album since 1972's \\"Exile on Main St.\\" - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences. - Exile on Main St. is a double album by English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 12 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records and was the band's tenth studio album released in the United Kingdom. The record's music incorporates rock and roll, blues, soul, country, and gospel genres. Although it originally received mixed reviews, \\"Exile on Main St.\\" has since been considered to be the Rolling Stones' best work while being ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time. - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. What entity does 'some girls ' has the relation 'performer' with?

Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the \\"powder keg of Europe.\\" In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the 33-day Second Balkan War, further destabilising the region.

Although advocated by Gaddafi and Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba, the move was deeply unpopular in Tunisia and soon abandoned. Retaliating, Gaddafi sponsored anti-government militants in Tunisia into the 1980s. Turning his attention to Algeria, in 1975 Libya signed the Hassi Messaoud defence agreement allegedly to counter \\"Moroccan expansionism\\", also funding the Polisario Front of Western Sahara in their independence struggle against Morocco.

A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Bexley is an area of south-east London, England and part of the London Borough of Bexley. It is located east-southeast of Charing Cross. It was an ancient parish in the county of Kent. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bexley increased in population, becoming a municipal borough in 1935 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Arts and Crafts movement was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between 1880 and 1910, emerging in Japan in the 1920s.

Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses. Each form of life is linked to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger. Which living things can use the sun's energy directly? A) Animals. B) Plants. C) Animals and plants. D) All living things. A:","completion":"B) Plants. All living things on Earth rely on each other in some way or form to survive. This interdependence creates various food chains, which are sequences of organisms where each organism feeds on the one below it. A crucial aspect of these food chains is the sun, as it provides the necessary energy for life to exist. However, not all living things can directly use the sun's energy. Plants have the unique ability to harness sunlight directly and convert it into food through a process called photosynthesis. In this process, plants use sunlight, water, and substances from the soil and air to produce glucose, which serves as a source of energy and building blocks for growth. This makes plants the primary producers in food chains, as they form the base of the chain by creating food from sunlight. Animals, on the other hand, cannot directly use the sun's energy. Instead, they rely on the food produced by plants, either by consuming the plants themselves (herbivores) or by eating other animals that have fed on plants (carnivores). This makes animals secondary consumers in the food chain. Thus, while animals do depend on the sun's energy for survival, they obtain it indirectly through their consumption of plants or other animals. In summary, it is plants that can directly use the sun's energy to produce food, making them the correct answer to the question (option B)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Community assets in England must all be kept on a list by councils who give local groups first refusal if they are sold. But ministers want to develop an approach \\"better suited\\" to Wales. Critics say they cannot understand the decision. Under the Localism Act, councils in England keep a register of \\"assets of community value\\". These could include libraries, playing fields and shops. If they come up for sale, community groups or parish councils are given a six month window to put together a bid to buy them on behalf of local people. There is a scheme in Scotland too. The Welsh government's communities minister had been considering enacting the legislation in Wales but last month she decided against the idea because she wants to spend time developing \\"an approach which is better suited to the Welsh context\\". In a statement, Lesley Griffiths told the BBC Sunday Politics Wales that the resource requirements could not be underestimated \\"including the need for adequate provision for monitoring and evaluation\\". Ms Griffiths also said she was mindful \\"of the legislative time pressures on the Welsh government currently\\" and she's concerned there could be \\"unrealistic expectations public funding will be provided to enable community organisations to purchase assets\\". Tim Hartley, a director of Supporters Direct, has been helping community groups in England to have sports grounds and stadia listed as assets of community value since the Localism Act came into force. Mr Hartley told the BBC Sunday Politics Wales: \\"This is not expensive, it's not a hassle. \\"I don't understand why the Welsh government won't bring in these elements of the Localism Act which will allow communities across Wales not only to safeguard but also to take ownership of these assets which they've been playing on for years and years.\\" Mr Hartley said listing sports grounds and pitches as community assets made \\"absolute sense\\" when councils were cutting back on their budgets. Mick Antoniw, Labour AM for Pontypridd said he was disappointed but had received some assurance from the minister that she was going to look at a \\"more effective and better way of supporting community trusts\\". Ms Griffiths said the government \\"greatly values the contribution key community facilities\\" but conceded it was unlikely any new approach will be implemented before the next Assembly elections in 2016. Sunday Politics Wales is broadcast on BBC One Wales at 12:25 GMT on Sunday 9 November Summary:","completion":"The English Localism Act requires councils to keep a register of assets of community value, which could include libraries, playing fields, and shops. If these assets go up for sale, local community groups are given a six-month window to bid on them. The Welsh government's communities minister considered applying similar legislation in Wales but decided against it, seeking an approach better suited to the Welsh context. Critics argue that the decision limits the ability of Welsh communities to take ownership of similar assets, while the minister cites the need for monitoring and evaluation as well as legislative time pressures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Title: Gadis Pantai - Girl from the Coast Review: I read this book (Gadis Pantai) in the original Indonesian many years ago and remember finding it incredibly sad and moving. I have read most of Pramoedya's more famous works (such as Bumi Manusia/This Earth of Mankind) but Gadis Pantai was my always my favourite because of its simplicity and the fact that it focussed on the story of someone who wouldn't normaly have their story told. The fact that it was written about the author's grandmother made it all the more moving for me. (I did always wonder what happened to her afterwards though).As I said I haven't read the English version so can't comment on the quality of the translation. I am pleased that it is available in English now though as it will make it so much more accessible to those interested in the work of the late Pramoedya or those just interested in one woman's moving story.

We can combine these terms by adding the coefficients: -30 + 26 = -4. This gives us: -4*i - 16 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable i Now, we want to isolate i on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 16 to both sides of the equation: -4*i = 16 Step 3: Solve for i To solve for i, we can divide both sides of the equation by -4: i = 16 / -4 Step 4: Calculate the result Now, we can calculate the value of i: i = -4 So, the solution to the equation -30*i + 26*i - 16 = 0 is i = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"In what decade was there a significant decline in industrial jobs?\\" Options are: - yes; - no;","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"In what decade was there a significant decline in industrial jobs?\\" The sentence directly mentions the 1970s as the decade when job losses occurred due to industrial restructuring. This indicates that there was a significant decline in industrial jobs during that period. Additionally, the sentence highlights the effects of these job losses on New York City, such as economic problems and rising crime rates, further emphasizing the importance of this issue in the given decade. The phrase \\"industrial restructuring\\" refers to the process by which industries undergo significant changes in their organization, technology, and production methods. This can lead to a reduction in the number of industrial jobs available, as companies may outsource jobs, adopt new technologies that reduce the need for human labor, or shift their focus to more profitable industries. In the case of New York City in the 1970s, industrial restructuring had widespread consequences. Many manufacturing jobs were lost as companies moved their operations to other countries with lower labor costs or transitioned to service-based industries. The loss of these jobs had a negative impact on the city's economy, as well as on the lives of the workers who were left without employment. The combination of economic issues and high unemployment rates contributed to a rise in crime during this time. With fewer job opportunities and a struggling economy, many individuals may have turned to criminal activities as a way to make ends meet. As a result, crime rates increased, further exacerbating the city's problems. In conclusion, the provided statement offers a valid answer to the question about the decade when there was a significant decline in industrial jobs. The 1970s were marked by industrial restructuring that led to job losses, economic problems, and rising crime rates in New York City, illustrating the far-reaching impact of such changes on both the city and its residents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: 1). unacceptable; 2). acceptable;","completion":"The sentence \\"Were you surprised that he stole the watch?\\" is linguistically acceptable. Let's break down the sentence in order to understand its linguistic acceptability. The sentence is a combination of an interrogative clause and a declarative noun clause. 1. Interrogative clause: \\"Were you surprised\\" The interrogative clause begins with the auxiliary verb \\"were,\\" which is the past tense of the verb \\"to be.\\" This is followed by the subject \\"you\\" and the main verb \\"surprised,\\" which is an adjective in this context. It is important to note that the interrogative form is correct, as the sentence begins with an auxiliary verb, followed by the subject and then the adjective. Therefore, this portion of the sentence is linguistically acceptable. 2. Declarative noun clause: \\"that he stole the watch\\" The declarative noun clause starts with the conjunction \\"that,\\" which introduces the clause and connects it to the main interrogative clause. It is followed by the subject \\"he,\\" the main verb \\"stole\\" (past tense of \\"steal\\"), and the direct object \\"the watch.\\" This noun clause functions as the object of the verb \\"surprised\\" in the main clause, providing further detail about the cause of the surprise. The structure of this clause is linguistically correct, as it follows the subject-verb-object pattern. Consequently, this part of the sentence is also acceptable. In summary, the sentence \\"Were you surprised that he stole the watch?\\" is linguistically acceptable, as both the interrogative clause and the declarative noun clause are structurally correct and adhere to the appropriate syntax rules of English grammar. The sentence effectively communicates the meaning, and it follows the standard of fluency and coherence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize: Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, an American-born Muslim convert, was sentenced to 30 years for what a judge called an \\"extraordinarily serious\\" crime. His two friends were shot dead after opening fire at an event that featured cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. A security guard was wounded but no-one else was injured in the attack. Kareem is the second person in the US to be convicted of charges supporting the so-called Islamic State (IS) group. Gunmen killed at Prophet Muhammad cartoons event IS claims US Prophet cartoon attack Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi were killed in a police shoot-out outside the conference in Garland, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, two years ago. The event, organised by a group critical of Islam, included a contest for drawings of the Prophet Muhammad - such pictorial depictions are considered forbidden by many Muslims. Prosecutors said Kareem had watched jihadist videos depicting violence with Simpson and Soofi, encouraged them to plot an attack to support the terrorist group and researched travel to the Middle East to join IS fighters. Kareem told Judge Susan Bolton he \\"had nothing to do with this crime\\". He said he did not know his friends had been planning to attack the conference and only found out about the shooting after they were killed. He also told jurors at his trial last year that he did not approve of Simpson using his laptop to watch al-Qaeda promotional videos. But prosecutor Kristen Brook argued Kareem had played an active role in helping attempt mass murder. \\"That just doesn't make him an outside participant or fringe guy,\\" she said. He was convicted of conspiring to support a foreign terrorist organisation and interstate transportation of firearms, among other charges. Authorities also claim he inquired about explosives to blow up the Arizona stadium, which is where the Super Bowl was held that year, before deciding on the cartoon event. Earlier this week, ex-convict Joseph Schreiber was sentenced to 30 years in prison for setting fire to a mosque that the Orlando nightclub shooter had occasionally attended. Schreiber pleaded no contest and was also ordered to pay 10,000 (Â£7,986). in compensation, despite damages to the mosque exceeding 100,000.

Summarize this article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: I would certainly apologise if you would like me to do that US President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to apologise for retweeting posts from a British far-right group. In an interview with ITV's Piers Morgan, Mr Trump said he knew \\"nothing\\" about Britain First before sharing three of its videos in November. \\"If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that,\\" he told Morgan. The interview, held in Davos, will be broadcast on 28 January at 22:00 GMT. The president's sharing of the controversial videos to his 40 million followers sparked a Twitter row with the UK prime minister, who criticised the move. \\"I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do,\\" Mrs May said, prompting Mr Trump to instruct the PM to focus on \\"terrorism\\" in the UK instead. 'Good relationship' Asked if he regretted the tweets, Mr Trump said, \\"it was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror\\". But he insisted he knew \\"nothing about\\" Britain First before sharing posts by the group's deputy leader Jayda Fransen - who is facing a trial in April, accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words at a protest in Belfast last year. \\"I know nothing about them, I don't want to be involved with people [like that],\\" Mr Trump told Morgan. One of the videos retweeted by Mr Trump shows unverified footage of a \\"Muslim migrant\\" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches, with another showing a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. The third video, originating from riots that took place in Egypt in 2013, shows a man being pushed from the top of a building. Mr Trump told Morgan: \\"Here's what's fair - if you're telling me they're horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that.\\" He also said the controversy was not a big story in the US.

Responding to Mr Trump's interview, Ms Fransen said she believed he had been \\"railroaded\\" into offering to apologise. She said: \\"The fact is Donald Trump retweeted those because they are a matter of national and worldwide security. \\"Islamic terrorism is affecting us all and he's been railroaded into saying he would offer an apology.\\" Ms Fransen said if she was really a \\"horrible, nasty racist\\" the US president \\"would condemn me\\". But she added: \\"It's not true.\\" 'Significant climbdown' Speaking to ITV after the interview, Morgan said it was \\"right and proper\\" that Mr Trump should apologise, adding: \\"I think this is a significant climbdown by the president\\". The pair have been amiable since Morgan, who has described the president as a \\"good friend\\", won the US reality show Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 - which was judged by Mr Trump. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered by an extremist who shouted \\"Britain First\\" as he fired his gun, praised Morgan for pushing for an apology. \\"Not many have succeeded in getting one,\\" said Mr Cox, who was among those who rebuked Mr Trump for promoting the far-right group. During the interview, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Mr Trump also told Morgan that he did not want to \\"cause any difficulty for your country\\". He spoke of his \\"love\\" for the UK and for Scotland in particular, which he described as a \\"very special place\\", despite cancelling a planned visit to the UK in February. Asked about whether some people were opposed to a UK visit, Mr Trump said: \\"I hadn't heard about banning, I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, [including] tough borders.\\" Mr Trump added that he had a \\"very good relationship\\" with the UK prime minister, who he met in Davos shortly before the interview on Thursday. \\"A lot of people think we don't,\\" he said. In an earlier exchange with the PM in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump told Mrs May: \\"We love your country.\\" He also said the US and UK were \\"joined at the hip\\" on military matters, while Mrs May said they stood \\"shoulder to shoulder\\" in facing shared threats. ||||| U.S. President Donald Trump arrives during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Friday, Jan. 26, 2018.

The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service. However, under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation's broadcasts. It now appears that Chinese COMPASS satellites will start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: Which of the following is not a band of frequencies: E1, ITU, or E5B? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, I will go through the passage to identify the bands of frequencies mentioned. 1. \\"Frequencies for COMPASS are allocated in four bands: E1, E2, E5B, and E6\\" - This sentence mentions four bands of frequencies: E1, E2, E5B, and E6. 2. The passage also discusses the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies. - ITU is mentioned as an organization responsible for policies related to frequency usage, but not as a band of frequencies. By analyzing these points from the passage, I can conclude that ITU is not a band of frequencies. The answer is: ITU."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.

Context: From 1789 to 1815, members of Congress received only a daily payment of 6 while in session. Members received an annual salary of 1,500 per year from 1815 to 1817, then a per diem salary of 8 from 1818 to 1855; since then they have received an annual salary, first pegged in 1855 at 3,000. In 1907, salaries were raised to 7,500 per year, the equivalent of 173,000 in 2010. In 2006, members of Congress received a yearly salary of 165,200. Congressional leaders were paid 183,500 per year. The Speaker of the House of Representatives earns 212,100 annually. The salary of the President pro tempore of the United States Senate for 2006 was 183,500, equal to that of the Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives and Party leaders of the United States Senate. Privileges include having an office and paid staff. In 2008, non-officer members of Congress earned 169,300 annually. Some critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median American Household income in the United States of 45,113 for men and 35,102 for women. Others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government. Another criticism is that members of Congress have access to free or low-cost medical care in the Washington D.C. area. The petition, \\"Remove health-care subsidies for Members of Congress and their families\\", has already gathered over 1,076,000 signatures on the website Change.org. In January 2014, it was reported that for the first time over half of the members of Congress were millionaires. Congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute. Others have criticized the wealth of members of Congress. Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving––that Congress was a \\"Farm team for K Street (Washington, D.C.)\\"––instead of on public service.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jim and Greg are brothers who both run their own farms, but they rarely see each other due to them living in different states. Greg runs a farm in Texas where he rarely sees rain so he spends much of his day watering his crops. Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will Greg's lake have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Greg's lake will have more carbon dioxide than Jim's lake. The reason behind this conclusion lies in the fact that Jim's farm is located in Illinois, where it rains more regularly. This regular rain causes fertilizer to dissolve in the soil and create runoff, which then carries the dissolved fertilizer to nearby bodies of water, such as the lake adjacent to Jim's farm. When the nitrogen-rich fertilizer enters the water, it promotes the rapid growth of algae. Algae are photosynthetic organisms that consume carbon dioxide in the water. As algae thrive thanks to the presence of nitrogen, they use up more carbon dioxide in Jim's lake compared to its levels in Greg's lake. After the algae have died, decomposers break down the dead tissue and consume oxygen in the process. This process may eventually lead to the creation of a dead zone in Jim's lake, an area with very low oxygen levels where little can grow or thrive. On the other hand, Greg's farm in Texas doesn't experience much rain, leading to less dissolved fertilizer and subsequent runoff in his adjacent lake. This results in lower levels of nitrogen entering the water and fewer algae in Greg's lake. Consequently, Greg's lake will have higher concentrations of carbon dioxide since the algae do not grow as much due to the absence of nitrogen-rich water. In conclusion, it is more likely that Greg's lake will have more carbon dioxide than Jim's lake, owing to the differing rainfall patterns and their effects on the presence of nitrogen and growth of algae in the water bodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translation explanation: The original sentence, \\"Äänestys toimitetaan tänään klo 17.30,\\" is in Finnish, and it carries a message about a voting event happening today at a specific time. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's discuss the context and importance of voting in general, as well as the significance of punctuality in the voting process. Voting is an essential mechanism in a democratic society, giving people the power to make decisions on various issues and to select representatives or leaders in their government. It is a way for citizens to participate in the political process and voice their opinions on matters that impact their lives and the well-being of their community. In many countries, voting is organized and scheduled during specific hours, aiming to accommodate the majority of the population. Ensuring that the voting process is accessible to as many people as possible allows for a more representative outcome, reflecting the collective will of the people. In the given context, this voting event is scheduled for 5:30 PM, which is likely designed to accommodate those who have work or other commitments during the day. Punctuality in voting is crucial, as the voting time window may only last for several hours, and in some cases, even shorter. Missing the deadline might result in someone's voice not being counted, which could have an impact on the final decision. It is essential that citizens make sure they are aware of the voting times and locations, and plan ahead to ensure they can make an informed vote during the allocated time. Moreover, being well-prepared and educated in the issues to be voted on is essential, as it can influence how well a person's vote truly reflects their values and interests. Sometimes, the materials and information provided during the voting process can be overwhelming; doing some research and seeking expert insights before the voting event will enable voters to make better choices for themselves and their communities. Thus, the voting taking place at 5:30 PM today holds significant importance not only for the people participating but also for the community at large. The event demonstrates the democratic values practiced in the society, emphasizing the importance of individual opinions and the collective decision-making process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They visit Marie Antoinette in Versailles during the French Revolution in 1789. Getting caught in the Reign of Terror, Peabody is nearly sent to the guillotine to be executed by Maximilien Robespierre, but escapes with Sherman through the Paris sewers. In the present day, Sherman attends the Susan B. Anthony School on his first day of school. His knowledge of the apocryphal nature of the George Washington cherry-tree anecdote leads to a fight with one of his classmates, a girl named Penny Peterson, in the cafeteria where she treats him like a dog and puts him in a choke hold, humiliating him. Peabody is called in by Principal Purdy as Sherman had bit Penny in retaliation, and also confronted by Ms. Grunion, a Child Protective Services agent, who suspects that Sherman's behavior is due to being raised by a dog and plans to visit to their home to investigate whether he is an unfit parent. Peabody then invites Penny and her parents, Paul and Patty over for dinner to reconcile before Ms. Grunion arrives. Penny calls Sherman a liar for claiming first-hand knowledge of history. Despite Peabody's contrary instructions, Sherman shows Penny the WABAC to show proof and takes her into the past, where she stays in Ancient Egypt in 1332 BCE to marry King Tut.

They are noted for their scented flowers and often brightly colored berries. Different species of Daphne bloom at different times, making it possible to have a Daphne in flower at almost any season. 4. Cultivation and Maintenance: These terms generally refer to the activities involved in taking care of plants to ensure they grow and thrive. Cultivation involves tasks such as planting, watering, fertilizing, and pruning. Maintenance may include activities such as weeding, preventing or controlling pests and diseases, and ensuring the plants have suitable growing conditions in terms of light, temperature, humidity, and soil type. 5. Planting and Watering: These are two key elements of plant care. Planting refers to the act of putting a plant into the ground or into a pot so that it can grow, whereas watering refers to providing the plant with the necessary water it needs to survive and grow. 6. Characteristics and Description: These words suggest a detailed overview or account of a plant's features. This might include information about a plant's size, the color of its foliage and flowers, its growth habit and rate, its preferred growing conditions, its uses in landscaping or gardening, and any unique or notable features. 7. Seedlings: Seedlings refer to young plants that have recently germinated from a seed. These plants are usually very small and delicate, and require careful handling to prevent damage. Seedlings must be gradually exposed to their new growing conditions in a process known as hardening off, so they can acclimate to changes in temperature, light, and humidity. Seedlings maybe grown in special seed trays or pots before they are transplanted to their permanent growing positions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: The 60s decade was a time of major social and cultural change, and the trends of the 1960s reflected that. People were embracing a bohemian lifestyle and the Hippie Movement was born. To get the look that the hippies created, start thinking about theatrical costumes, recycled clothing, ethnic fashions, Indian prints, bright colors and mismatched patterns. Check out your nearest resale shop to look for vintage clothes and other items that you can repurpose, just like hippies did. Paisley prints and psychedelic prints are also great choices. You can’t go wrong by pairing those two elements together. Jeans came in all colors of the rainbow and often featured embroidery or appliqued designs. Keep an eye out for those details or add them yourself. Look for blouses with long and flowy \\"bubble\\" sleeves. Gauzy fabrics work great, too. Wear a simple chiffon baby-doll dress with spaghetti-straps for a feminine look. Hippies frequently went barefoot, but sandals and flip-flops were also popular. If you have boots or clogs, those will also work perfectly. You could have fun with fresh flowers, but fake ones will work. Daisies were especially popular and they were often worn instead of jewelry. Weave the flowers flowers into your hair and secure them with bobby pins. Try a simple braid adorned with flowers or weave them into a wreath to wear on your head like a crown. Gypsy scarves, flower headbands, and leather moccasins are all great options. Peace sign pendants, beaded jewelry, large rings, and chain belts will also work. You could also try stacked silver bangles, woven leather bracelets, and hooped earrings. Thrift stores will be gold mines for these items. There was a wide variety of hairstyles in the 1960s, the most iconic being the very long, natural looking style that the hippies wore. Part it down the middle and allow it to hang loose and free. If you don’t have long hair, check out wigs at your local costume shop. The beehive hairstyle was also very stylish. The hippies usually went for a natural look and wore very little makeup. They did use face paint, however, especially for special events and festivals. Paint images of daisies, rainbows, and peace signs on your cheeks or forehead. Add some face glitter for a little sparkle. For those that did wear makeup, it was variable. However a pale mouth, large false eye lashes and exaggerated eye makeup will be instantly recognizable. For real life references of 60s makeup and hairstyles, look up pictures of icons like Twiggy, Brigitte Bardot, Janis Joplin, Edie Sedgewick, Jane Birkin and Marianne Faithfull.","completion":"The 1960s was a decade marked by significant social and cultural changes, with people adopting the bohemian lifestyle and giving birth to the Hippie Movement.

Four stars for meeting my expectations based on other yelpers....... We were not extremely hungry. I ordered the chicken Tandoori tiki, (hope I got that right... as I don't have my handy-dandy Asian Indian food guide close by...) and my wife, ordered the okra, which comes with basmati rice. We also ordered garlic nan, and for a specialty beverage, the mango lassi; a mango-yogurt drink. I'll say up front; \\"Everything was very good, and the mango drink was very much like what we drink, Brasilian style, mixing papaya, mango or passion fruit, with various forms of yogurt, ice cream, or condensed milk. I bet I've passed this place twenty five times over the past few years when in Vegas on business. The building is old looking, near the bus stop at the front of an older strip center, and in an older section of West Vegas. But once you walk inside, see a relatively nice interior, and see the many regulars we saw, you're probably going to have the same high level of confidence we had. While service is stereotypical-etchnic restaurant-slow and spotty......... the food does deliver. It will never be as good as homemade, if you cook Indian at home, but then, as a Brasilian family, we rarely find stateside restaurants that meet our standards. That's to be expected.

If it's good enough for the many Indian clients I saw there tonight, then I'm sure it'll be good enough for you. Remember that Indian clients could go anywhere in town, but there was a good number of couples and foursomes dining in tonight.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

Write an article using the following points: Asya Kozina creates wedding gowns inspired by classic Mongolian dress. She studied historical illustrations and sepia photos when designing. Chooses to use paper as a metaphor for 'life and art'","completion":"Title: Asya Kozina's Artful Paper Creations: Breathing New Life into Classic Mongolian Wedding Gowns Introduction: Imagine walking down the aisle donning a wedding gown inspired by the rich heritage of Mongolian culture, meticulously crafted with the most humble of all mediums—paper. This is the innovative and imaginative world of Asya Kozina, an artist who has turned the concept of traditional wedding attire on its head. Step 1: Introduce Asya Kozina Asya Kozina is a talented artist known for her unique approach to fashion, seamlessly blending historical inspiration with modern design. Her creations celebrate the beauty and intricacy of Mongolian culture, and her willingness to push boundaries has garnered her significant attention in the art and fashion worlds. Step 2: Discuss her inspiration from historical illustrations and sepia photos Kozina's journey into the world of Mongolian-inspired wedding gowns began with an exploration of historical illustrations and sepia-toned photographs. These sources provided a glimpse into the complex designs, patterns, and symbolism found in traditional Mongolian attire, which she then adapted to create her own stunning wedding gowns. Step 3: Elaborate on her decision to use paper as a medium By choosing to work with paper as her primary medium, Kozina transforms a seemingly ordinary material into a remarkable representation of 'life and art.' Paper, both delicate and strong, alludes to the many facets of human experience, reflecting the complexities that we face in our individual and shared journeys. Step 4: Discuss the metaphor of 'life and art' in her creations In Kozina's hands, paper serves as a reminder of the impermanence and beauty of life, making it the ideal medium for representing the love and dedication that a wedding signifies. The delicate and intricate nature of paper artistry symbolizes the fragility of relationships and the need for constant nurturing and care, echoing the importance of communication and compromise in a successful marriage. Step 5: Describe the details of her Mongolian-inspired wedding gowns Kozina's wedding gowns embody the rich traditions of Mongolian culture through the intricate patterns and designs she has incorporated into each piece. She pays homage to the classic Mongolian dress with its bold patterns and elaborate ornamentation while imprinting her own unique artistic vision onto each gown. Conclusion: Asya Kozina's paper wedding gowns are not only visually arresting and enchanting but also serve as thought-provoking conversation pieces, inviting us to reconsider the importance of tradition, heritage, and the beauty found in the artistry of everyday materials. These gowns remind us that, like paper, life is delicate, yet full of the potential to create something truly extraordinary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Roberto Mangabeira Unger (; born 24 March 1947) is a philosopher and politician. He has developed his views and positions across many fields, including social, political, and economic theory. In legal theory, he is best known by his work in the 1970s and 80s while at Harvard Law School as part of the Critical Legal Studies movement, which is held to have helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools. His political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil in the aftermath of the military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015. Unger's critique of economics begins with the identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger's analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and as a means to escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, marginalist economics arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we wanted to live in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value. Unger's critique of Marginalism begins with Walras' equilibrium theory, which attempted to achieve a certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market has been shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations. The consequences of the marginalist movement were profound for the study of economics, Unger says. The most immediate problem is that under this generalizing tendency of economics, there is no means by which to incorporate empirical evidence and thus to re-imagine the world and develop new theories and new directions. In this way, the discipline is always self-referential and theoretical. Furthermore, the lack of a normative view of the world curtails the ability to propose anything more than a policy prescription, which by definition always assumes a given context. The discipline can only rationalize the world and support a status quo. Lastly, Unger finds that this turn in economics ended up universalizing debates in macroeconomics and leaving the discipline without any historical perspective. A consequence, for example, was that Keynes' solution to a particular historical crisis was turned into a general theory when it should only be understood as a response to a particular situation. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: how did he identify this key moment","completion":"Roberto Mangabeira Unger identified the key moment in economic history as the point when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity.

Given the question: Given the background: The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions. and the situation: Stef is a young girl interested in the geography of the world. For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is. She is specifically looking at Norway, a country near the North Pole, and Mexico, a country close to the equator. Answer the following question: Will Norway be less accurately represented on the globe or the map? The answer is:","completion":"Norway will be less accurately represented on the map. The reason for this is Norway's high latitude. The further a country is from the equator, the more distorted it becomes on a Mercator projection map. This distortion involves an exaggeration of the size and a change in the shape of the country. In this case, Norway, being located near the North Pole, will appear much larger and more stretched out on the Mercator map than it truly is. Conversely, a globe represents all countries at their actual proportions and angles because it's a 3D model unaffected by the distortion caused by flattening the spherical Earth onto a 2D surface like a map. Thus, the representation of Norway on the globe would be a lot more accurate than on the Mercator map. Mexico, nearer to the equator, would look more or less the same on both the map and the globe due to the Mercator projection's properties of minimal distortions around the equator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet? Massenet was a fluent and skilful orchestrator, and willingly provided ballet episodes for his operas, incidental music for plays, and a one-act stand-alone ballet for Vienna (Le carillon, 1892). Macdonald remarks that Massenet's orchestral style resembled that of Delibes, \\"with its graceful movement and bewitching colour\\", which was highly suited to classical French ballet. The Méditation for solo violin and orchestra, from Thaïs, is possibly the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet, and appears on many recordings. Another popular stand-alone orchestral piece from the operas is Le dernier sommeil de la Vierge from La Vierge, which has featured on numerous discs since the middle of the 20th century.A Parisian critic, after seeing La grand' tante, declared that Massenet was a symphonist rather than a theatre composer. At the time of the British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral. Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, \\"What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise I would not be myself.\\" His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire. Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive.

Imagine we have a basket, and we take out 37 candies and then put back 37 candies. Now, let's see what happens: We start with this equation: 0 = -l + 37 - 37 First, we notice that there is a \\"+37\\" and a \\"-37\\". Adding 37 and then subtracting 37 doesn't change anything, like taking out 37 candies and then putting them back. So, we can ignore those two numbers: 0 = -l Now, we're left with the equation without the 37 candies. We need to find the value of \\"l\\". Currently, \\"l\\" is being multiplied by -1 (that's what the \\"-\\" sign means). To solve for \\"l\\", we need to do the opposite. Instead of multiplying by -1, we need to divide by -1: 0 ÷ -1 = l And you know what? Zero divided by any number (even -1) is still zero.

Three-week-old Eliza was found dead after being abducted. Her mother, father and uncle were shot at a home in Long Beach. Article:","completion":"Title: 25,000 Reward Established by County Board for Information in Long Beach Tragedy In a recent move to encourage community involvement and expedite closure for a grieving family, the County Board has announced the establishment of a 25,000 reward for any information that leads to the conviction of the individual or individuals responsible for a horrific crime in Long Beach. Three weeks ago, the unimaginable happened when three-week-old baby Eliza was abducted from her family home, only to be found dead some hours later. Her mother, father, and uncle were also shot in a merciless and senseless act of violence that has shaken the community to the core. Though the tragic event has triggered an outpouring of condolences and support for the devastated family, the culprits behind these heinous crimes remain unpunished. The 25,000 reward, now being offered by the County Board, represents a significant measure to encourage potential witnesses or individuals with knowledge of the crime to come forward and provide information that could aid the investigation. The belief is that someone in the community may hold the key to revealing the perpetrators and helping bring justice for baby Eliza and her heartbroken family. The Long Beach Police Department has been working diligently to uncover any possible leads they can use to help identify and apprehend the criminals behind this terrible tragedy. Law enforcement is appealing to the public and urging anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity in the vicinity of the crime or has any relevant information to come forward, even if they think their information is insignificant. The magnitude of this tragedy has prompted a large-scale community response, with people assembling in support of the family and in pursuit of justice for the innocent lives lost. Residents of Long Beach have come together in candlelight vigils, prayer gatherings, and community meetings in an atmosphere of unity and resilience. The shared goal is to ensure that baby Eliza, her mother, father, and uncle did not die in vain. While no family should ever have to endure such heartache, the immense public response has shone a light of hope amidst the darkness. The determination to advocate for justice, to stand up against senseless violence, and to support those who have been affected by such crimes is a testament to the strength and character of the Long Beach community. As the investigation continues, it is essential that the community remains vigilant and steadfast in its commitment to seeking answers and justice. The County Board's decision to offer a substantial reward for information is a powerful show of support for the family, as well as a clear message to those responsible for these despicable acts that they cannot evade justice forever. By coming together, the people of Long Beach are sending an unequivocal signal: their community will not be defeated by violence and tragedy. The determination to bring those responsible to justice, and to heal as a community, serves as a beacon of hope for a brighter, stronger future. Anyone with information regarding this case can contact the Long Beach Police Department or report their tip anonymously through the designated crime hotline. The County Board remains committed to supporting the family and the broader community as the investigation unfolds, and authorities hope that the 25,000 reward will be the catalyst that brings forth vital information in solving this heart-wrenching case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"To determine the category for \\"A Date with Jimmy Smith Volume Two,\\" let's analyze the title step-by-step and justify our decision. 1. First, let's look at the words in the title. It mentions a specific person named Jimmy Smith, and it is associated with Volume Two. This could imply that it is part of a series or collection. 2. Now, let's rule out some categories that don't fit this title. It is unlikely to be a company, educational institution, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, or film (given it's a volume). 3. With the remaining categories - artist, album, and written work - we can make a more informed decision. Knowing that Jimmy Smith was a famous jazz musician, it is highly possible that \\"A Date with Jimmy Smith Volume Two\\" is related to his work. 4. Since it mentions \\"Volume Two\\" in the title, it is less likely to be an artist category as it implies a continuation or collection of works. Therefore, we are left with album and written work. 5. Jazz musicians typically release albums instead of written works.

At this time in the early 1960s, Feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time, including a request, while at Caltech, to \\"spruce up\\" the teaching of undergraduates. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics. He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book. Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image, the publishers changed the cover to plain red, though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword. The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, as part-time co-authors for several years. Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics. Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including The Character of Physical Law, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, Statistical Mechanics, Lectures on Gravitation, and the Feynman Lectures on Computation.

And, in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (a very enjoyable supporting actor) was in this film,...so why didn't I particularly enjoy it?! Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd \\"A pictures\\" I have ever seen. Given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is shocking how slip-shod the writing was. I knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film I found myself predicting EXACTLY what would happen next--and I was always right! And this isn't because I am some sort of \\"movie savant\\", but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it. In fact, it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together! Also, I found it a bit irritating that Fred mistreated Carole so bad throughout the film and yet, true to convention, she came running to him in the end. Uggh! There is MORE suspense in a Lassie film (\\"will he bring people to rescue Timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break?\\"). Despite the very, very tired and clichéd script, there were a few positives about the film. It was pretty cool seeing Fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film--it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten, shaved or slept in days. Also, Charles Butterworth's \\"prattle\\" did provide a few mildly humorous moments. But all this just wasn't enough to make this film look any different than a \\"B movie\\".

A few positive aspects are mentioned (e.g., a believable performance and occasional humorous moments) but these are outweighed by the overall negative tone and dissatisfaction of the reviewer.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. John William Money (8 July 1921 - 7 July 2006) was a psychologist, sexologist and author, specializing in research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of \\"gender\\" affect an individual. More recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer and his eventual suicide. Money's writing has been translated into many languages, and includes around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews. In this book (Oxford 1988: 116), Money develops a conception of 'bodymind,' as a way for scientists, in developing a science about sexuality, to move on from the platitudes of dichotomy between nature versus nurture, innate versus the acquired, biological versus the social, and psychological versus the physiological. He suggests that all of these capitalize on the ancient, pre-Platonic, pre-biblical conception of body versus the mind, and the physical versus the spiritual. In coining the term \\"bodymind\\", in this sense, Money wishes to move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology. Money also develops here (Oxford 1988: 114-119) a view of \\"Concepts of Determinism,\\" which, transcultural, transhistorical, and universal, all people have in common, sexologically or otherwise. These include pairbondage, troopbondage, abidance, ycleptance, foredoomance, with these coping strategies: adhibition (engagement), inhibition, explication. Money suggests that the concept of threshold (Oxford 1988: 115) - the release or inhibition of sexual (or other) behavior - is most useful for sex research as a substitute for any concept of motivation. Moreover, it confers the distinct advantage of having continuity and unity to what would otherwise be a highly disparate and varied field of research. It also allows for the classification of sexual behavior. For Money, the concept of threshold has great value because of the wide spectrum to which it applies. \\"It allows one to think developmentally or longitudinally, in terms of stages or experiences that are programmed serially, or hierarchically, or cybernetically (i.e. regulated by mutual feedback).\\" (Oxford 1988: 116) Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What is the book about?","completion":"The book is about the author's John Money's approach to understanding sexual identity and gender biology.

He uses the term bodymind to \\"move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology.\\" The book also introduces Money's view of \\"Concepts of Determinism,\\" which are common to all people. Furthermore, he advocates for the use of the concept of 'threshold' in sex research as it brings continuity and unity to the otherwise varied field of research.

Given the question: Process: - Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose A balance in nutrition is made happens, how will it affect more food will be digested. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which implies a balance in nutrition, can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of digestion. A well-balanced diet provides the body with the essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required for optimal functioning, as well as the energy needed for numerous biochemical reactions, including those involved in digestion. Direct Effects: 1. Improved enzymatic reactions: A balanced diet ensures that the body receives adequate amounts of nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, which act as cofactors for various enzymes involved in digestion. For instance, the presence of sufficient amounts of magnesium is crucial for the proper functioning of enzymes that break down carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Enhanced enzymatic reactions allow for more efficient breaking down of food, thereby promoting better digestion. 2. Adequate production of stomach acids: A well-nourished diet ensures the body has the necessary components to produce stomach acids, such as hydrochloric acid, which play a crucial role in breaking down food in the stomach. Balanced nutrition can lead to the appropriate production of stomach acids, resulting in optimal digestion and absorption of nutrients. 3. Proper peristalsis: A balanced diet provides adequate amounts of dietary fiber, which is essential for maintaining proper bowel movement and peristalsis—the involuntary muscle contractions that move food through the digestive system. A well-functioning peristaltic mechanism makes digestion more efficient as it ensures that food moves effectively through the digestive tract. Indirect Effects: 1. Stronger immune system: A balanced diet strengthens the immune system, enabling it to better combat pathogens and prevent infections. Since the digestive system is susceptible to infections by bacteria, viruses, or parasites, a stronger immune system can help maintain the overall health of the gastrointestinal tract, thus indirectly improving digestion. 2. Optimal gut microbiome: A well-balanced diet promotes a healthy gut microbiome that contributes to digestion. The gut microbiome comprises diverse bacterial populations that aid in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, synthesizing vitamins, and fermenting dietary fiber. These beneficial microorganisms also play a role in modulating the immune system and maintaining gut health, which indirectly affects the efficiency of digestion. 3. Enhanced energy production: A balanced diet ensures that the body has adequate fuel to generate energy. In turn, this energy supports the numerous biochemical reactions, including the process of digestion. When the body has enough energy, it can allocate resources to digestion, enhancing its efficiency and allowing for better absorption and utilization of nutrients. 4. Reduced inflammation and better gut health: Consuming a balanced diet that includes adequate portions of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supplies the body with essential antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that can help combat inflammation. Lower inflammation levels lead to improved gut health, which fosters a conducive environment for digestion and nutrient absorption. In conclusion, the perturbation brought about by a balanced diet can have both direct and indirect effects on the digestive process. By promoting the proper functioning of enzymes, enhancing stomach acid production, maintaining an optimal gut microbiome, and supporting overall energy and immune function, a well-balanced diet contributes to more efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -280*y - 2744 = 138*y - 40*y - 98 for y.","completion":"To solve the equation -280*y - 2744 = 138*y - 40*y - 98 for the variable y, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation First, simplify the equation by combining the terms with the variable y on each side: The right side of the equation has two y terms: 138*y and -40*y. Combine these to get 138*y - 40*y = 98*y. Our simplified equation is: -280*y - 2744 = 98*y - 98 Step 2: Get all the y terms on one side of the equation To do this, add 280*y to both sides of the equation to move the -280*y term to the right side: -280*y + 280*y - 2744 = 98*y + 280*y - 98 This simplifies to: -2744 = 378*y - 98 Step 3: Move the constant terms to the left side of the equation Add 98 to both sides to move the -98 term to the left side: -2744 + 98 = 378*y - 98 + 98 This simplifies to: -2646 = 378*y Step 4: Solve for y To solve for y, divide both sides of the equation by 378: -2646 / 378 = 378*y / 378 This simplifies to: y = -7 So the solution to the equation -280*y - 2744 = 138*y - 40*y - 98 is y = -7."},{"prompt":"Is this product review positive?

Plymouth: The redevelopment of the city was planned by Sir Patrick Abercrombie in his 1943 Plan for Plymouth whilst simultaneously working on the reconstruction plan for London. Between 1951 and 1957 over 1000 homes were completed every year mostly using innovative prefabricated systems of just three main types; by 1964 over 20,000 new homes had been built transforming the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia. Most of the city centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece allowed to fall into disrepair by its owner Plymouth City Council but recently grade II listed by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.

I'll address each of them separately and provide some suggestions on how to handle the issues you have raised. 1. Feeling like falling over and experiencing blurry vision It is not normal to feel like falling over or have blurry vision when you wake up and walk to the hallway. These symptoms could be caused by various factors, some of which are: a. Orthostatic Hypotension: This is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing up. It can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and even blurred vision. It's essential to get up gradually from a lying to a standing position to give your body time to adjust to the change in posture. b. Dehydration: Dehydration can lead to dizziness and blurry vision because it affects the overall balance of fluids in your body, including blood flow to the brain and the proper functioning of the eyes. c. Sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality: Inadequate sleep can have a detrimental effect on your body and mind, including dizziness and impaired vision upon waking up. To resolve these issues, consider the following: - Stand up slowly when getting out of bed. - Ensure you are properly hydrated by drinking enough water throughout the day. - Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night. - Keep a consistent sleep schedule. - Consult a healthcare professional if the symptoms persist. 2. Feeling depressed and like a stagnant human being during and after waking up The factors contributing to this feeling might include poor sleep quality, an unhealthy lifestyle, or even a clinical case of depression, among others. Here are some suggestions on how to address these feelings: a. Create a morning routine: Having a consistent and healthy morning routine can help start your day on a positive note. Try activities like stretching, meditation, or journaling to establish a more fulfilling start to the day. b. Engage in physical activity: Exercise is known to boost mood, energy levels, and overall mental health. Incorporate exercise into your daily routine, ideally in the morning, to improve your mood and well-being. c. Eat a healthy breakfast: Consuming a nutritious meal in the morning can improve cognitive function and sustain energy levels throughout the day. d. Connect with others: Socializing with friends or family members can elevate your mood and help you feel more engaged in life. e. Seek professional help: If your feelings of depression are persistent, it might be advisable to consult a mental health professional to explore various therapeutic options. In summary, these two questions address different aspects of your well-being. The first deals with potential physical causes of dizziness and blurry vision upon waking up, while the second discusses feelings of depression and stagnation in the morning hours. It is important to address both issues by adopting healthy lifestyle habits and consulting professionals if necessary to improve your overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - hydrogen - gas - water - mercury A:","completion":"The only metal that is liquid at room temperature is mercury. Among the given choices, hydrogen is an element, but it is a gas at room temperature and not a metal. Gas refers to a state of matter and is not an element itself. Lastly, water is a liquid at room temperature, but it is a compound made of hydrogen and oxygen, not a metal. Mercury, with the chemical symbol Hg and atomic number 80, is a unique metal in that it is a liquid at room temperature (about 20-25 degrees Celsius or 68-77 degrees Fahrenheit). This property is due to its relatively weak bonds between atoms. Mercury has a melting point of -38.83 degrees Celsius (-37.89 degrees Fahrenheit) and a boiling point of 356.73 degrees Celsius (674.11 degrees Fahrenheit). Mercury is a fascinating element with a range of applications. It is most well-known for its use in older thermometers due to its ability to expand and contract uniformly as the temperature changes. However, in recent years, the use of mercury for measuring temperature has diminished because of its harmful effects on human health and the environment. Mercury is highly toxic, and extended exposure can lead to health problems such as kidney damage, respiratory failure, and negative neurological effects. Beyond thermometers, mercury has been used in other applications, including barometers to measure atmospheric pressure, various types of electrical switches, and dental amalgams for filling cavities. Additionally, mercury's high density has made it a choice material for liquid mirror telescopes. Despite its numerous uses, there is a growing concern regarding mercury's impact on both human health and the environment. Many countries have introduced or strengthened regulations to limit the emission of mercury and phase out its usage in consumer products. The Minamata Convention on Mercury, a global treaty adopted in 2013, embodies the international effort to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. In conclusion, mercury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature, setting it apart from other metals with its unique properties and diverse applications. However, due to its toxicity and environmental concerns, efforts are being made to reduce the use of mercury in everyday life and implement safer alternatives wherever possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Is Saints QB Drew Brees worth two first-round draft picks? NFL teams can begin placing the franchise tag on potential free agents Feb. 20. The mechanism has historically been a very effective way to restrict movement since another club must not only make an enticing contract offer to pry a tagged player loose, it must surrender two first-round picks to the player's original team if it chooses not to match the offer. Only three franchised players have switched teams at that cost, and none since 1998. (Teams have negotiated different terms, such as QB Matt Cassel's move from New England to Kansas City in 2009 for one second-round pick.) But wouldn't Saints QB Drew Brees be worth two first-rounders? Let's couch this hypothetical upfront: Brees could re-sign with the Saints before Monday, allowing the team to potentially tag all-pro G Carl Nicks or WR Marques Colston instead; if Brees is tagged, he could also get hit with the exclusive version of the tag, which doesn't allow other teams to even negotiate with him. Brees also said prior to the Super Bowl that he expected to be re-signed soon and should be a Saint for the rest of his career. But let's say, for argument's sake, New Orleans tagged Brees but let other teams talk to him. Brees, twice the offensive player of the year since 2008, just turned 33 and comes off a season where he set single-season records for passing yards (5,476), completion rate (71.2%) and total completions (468). His 2011 campaign aside, Brees' run in New Orleans has produced the most prolific six-year stretch for passing yards (28,394) by one player in league history. (Though you could argue that his symbiosis with the Saints and HC Sean Payton is otherworldly and wouldn't translate in another city.) Since suffering the shoulder injury that led to his departure from the Chargers after the 2005 season, Brees hasn't missed a game due to injury and has only been sacked an average of 19.3 times per season with New Orleans, a remarkable figure given his number of dropbacks. He's also a workout warrior in the offseason. But put aside the stats. Brees may be even more renowned for his locker room leadership, not to mention his community service. Two first-round picks (and maybe a contract that averages roughly 18 million annually, same as Tom Brady and Peyton Manning received in recent years) for a player in a league now largely defined by its quarterbacks seems a veritable bargain, no? What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is discussing whether Saints quarterback Drew Brees is worth two first-round draft picks in the NFL. Brees has impressive stats, strong leadership, and dedication to community service. He could re-sign with the Saints before Monday, which may affect who the team tags. However, the article suggests that two first-round picks and possibly an 18 million annual contract for a player like Brees could be a good deal in a league that values quarterbacks highly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer. The baby then playfully bonks Tom on the head. Answer:","completion":"Tom and Jerry fear that the baby has crawled into a cement mixer at a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site.

In his pursuit to become healthier, he thought it was essential to not only improve his physical health but also his mental well-being. Cycling offered an all-encompassing experience that allowed him to achieve both of these goals simultaneously. Step 1: Benjamin started by identifying the different types of bikes available and their intended purposes. This step was necessary since bikes were designed for various terrains and activities, such as mountain biking, road cycling, and leisure riding. Step 2: After thorough research, Benjamin chose a hybrid bike that was suitable for both on and off-road cycling. This choice allowed him to explore nature trails and ride on paved paths without having to switch bikes. Step 3: To ensure that he was making the most out of his biking experience, Benjamin invested in essential safety gear such as a helmet, reflective clothing and accessories, lights for nighttime visibility, and a high-quality bike lock. Step 4: Benjamin also took the time to learn basic bike maintenance skills. This step proved to be invaluable as it allowed him to keep his bike in top condition and saved him money on costly repairs in the long run. Step 5: With his bike ready and safety measures in place, Benjamin started to incorporate cycling into his daily routine. He decided to ride his bike to work, run errands, and visit friends whenever possible. Not only did this help him meet his fitness goals, but it also allowed him to reduce his carbon footprint – another source of satisfaction to him. Step 6: In addition to his daily rides, Benjamin joined a local cycling group on weekends. This allowed him to socialize, discover new routes, learn from experienced cyclists, and hold himself accountable for his exercise goals. Step 7: To track his progress, Benjamin used a fitness tracker and cycling apps that provided insights into his performance, such as distance, speed, and duration. These tools motivated him to stay committed to cycling and see the tangible results of his efforts. Step 8: Benjamin's commitment to cycling soon led to noticeable improvements in his health and wellness. His cardiovascular endurance increased, his muscles became stronger, and his stress levels decreased significantly due to the meditative effects of cycling and spending time outdoors. Step 9: As Benjamin continued to see positive results from his cycling endeavors, he also started making healthier food choices. Nutrition played a significant role in optimizing his performance on the bike and helped in reaching his weight loss goals. With perseverance and a comprehensive approach, Benjamin successfully integrated cycling into his lifestyle, reaching not only his physical fitness goals but also reaping the emotional and mental rewards that came along with it. As his journey continued, he found himself not only in better shape but also with a newfound appreciation for the great outdoors and the sense of freedom that only cycling could offer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid.

Answer the following question: This article: The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758. The Booth-Greys then held the manor until the 19th century, whose patronage, despite being... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money?, what is it ?

In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.

(CNN) -- Since taking the helm of Yahoo after years in Google's upper echelon, Marissa Mayer has been at the center of plenty of talk not focused on turning around the once-mighty Web giant. As Silicon Valley's most prominent woman, her appearance, her motherhood and the way her policies will affect female employees have all, fairly or not, been the subject of spirited discussion. Now, a two-page photo spread in September's Vogue magazine has them talking again. In the photo, Mayer lies upside-down on a backyard lounge chair, wearing a blue Michael Kors dress. Her blond hair fans out at the foot of the chair, her Yves Saint Laurent stiletto heels point toward the top and she holds a tablet computer featuring a stylized image of her face. \\"However, still wincing over Marissa Mayer all stretched out for","completion":"Vogue, while simultaneously trying to prove she's a serious CEO,\\" tweeted one observer. Critics argue that the photo undermines Mayer's accomplishments as a business leader and reinforces negative stereotypes about women in tech. But others say the backlash is unwarranted and that Mayer's decision to be featured in a fashion magazine can be seen as a powerful statement for women in the industry. This isn't the first time Mayer has faced scrutiny over her appearance and decisions. When she was named CEO of Yahoo in 2012, much of the conversation revolved around whether she would succeed and how she would balance work and her upcoming motherhood. Mayer's decision to shorten maternity leaves and ban telecommuting at Yahoo sparked debates on issues parents face in the workplace, with many questioning her commitment to promoting a family-friendly environment at the tech giant. But as the company's first female CEO, Mayer has also helped to make strides for women in leadership. Under her guidance, the proportion of women in leadership roles at Yahoo increased from 23 percent in 2013 to 24 percent in 2016. She also invested in programs aimed at supporting women entrepreneurs and raising awareness about gender inequality in the industry. The Vogue photo spread, though controversial, highlights a key issue: the persistent double standard that exists for prominent women in business and technology. Women in these industries often face a Catch-22 situation – embracing femininity can lead to critiques and doubts about their competence, while adopting traditionally masculine traits in order to be taken seriously can result in accusations of being \\"unlikable\\" or \\"unfeminine.\\" Mayer's choice to be featured in a fashion-forward photo in one of the world's leading magazines shows her refusal to be limited by traditional perceptions of what a tech executive should look like and act. In showcasing her unique blend of style and substance, Mayer is forging her own path and breaking down barriers for other women in the field. She sends the powerful message that a woman can embrace her femininity while also being a strong leader and running a major company. Moreover, she has openly talked about her career, her success, and her family life, hoping to inspire women to pursue a career in the tech industry. Mayer has been open about her journey as a mother, and how she balances her executive position with raising her children. This transparency contributes to clearing obstacles that other women might face when considering entering tech leadership roles. While the Vogue photo might have generated intense debate, it ultimately allowed important discussions to be had about the expectations and stereotypes surrounding women in leadership positions, particularly within the tech industry. As one of the most visible female leaders in technology, Mayer has the power to redefine and reshape these expectations, demonstrating that women can succeed in male-dominated industries and embrace their personal style without sacrificing their professional credibility."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Claret wine is produced in the region surrounding which French city????","completion":"Claret wine is predominantly produced in the region surrounding Bordeaux, a French city located along the Garonne River in the southwestern part of the country. The Bordeaux wine region is one of the world's most famous and prestigious wine-producing areas, with a history that dates back nearly 2,000 years. The term \\"claret\\" is commonly used in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries to refer to the red wines from this region. The Bordeaux region consists of six primary sub-regions or appellations, namely Médoc, Graves, Pomerol, Saint-Émilion, Sauternes, and Barsac. Covering over 100,000 hectares of vineyards, it is home to over 8,000 wine-producing estates or châteaux, each crafting wines with distinct characteristics and flavors. The claret wines produced in Bordeaux are typically blends of several grape varieties, with the most important ones being Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cabernet Franc. Other grape varieties that may also be included in the blends are Petit Verdot, Malbec, and, occasionally, Carménère. Bordeaux's unique terroir, characterized by its diverse soils, varying climate conditions, and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gironde Estuary, plays a crucial role in the quality and taste of claret wines. The region experiences mild winters and long, warm summers, providing ideal conditions for grape cultivation. The soil composition varies across the Bordeaux region, with some areas having gravel and limestone soils while others have clay or sand-based soils. These differences in terroir result in distinct styles of claret wines that are appreciated worldwide. Bordeaux claret wines are generally categorized into Left Bank and Right Bank wines, based on the location of the vineyards relative to the Gironde Estuary and the Garonne and Dordogne rivers that it encompasses. Left Bank wines, coming from the Médoc and Graves regions, are often Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant with more structured tannins, while Right Bank wines, originating from the Pomerol and Saint-Émilion regions, tend to have a higher proportion of Merlot, offering rounder and fruitier flavors. The production process of claret wines in Bordeaux follows strict regulations and guidelines set by the region’s appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system, which helps maintain the quality, standards, and authenticity of the wines. Each step of the wine-making process, from grape growing and harvesting to fermentation and aging, is governed by these rules. Typically, Bordeaux red wines, including clarets, are aged in oak barrels for a period of time, which imparts complexity, structure, and additional flavor dimensions to the wines. In conclusion, Bordeaux, a renowned French city, is at the heart of claret wine production. The region's unique terroir and the blending of different grape varieties contribute to the exceptional quality and variety of claret wines that have gained popularity and acclaim around the globe. With their rich history, adherence to strict production standards, and diverse range of styles and flavors, Bordeaux claret wines continue to hold a prestigious position in the world of wine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the open top bus party, the bus takes a wrong turning and the team have to endure a very cold, lengthly detour up the A11.After the opening titles, the news comes in that England manager Phil Cope has had a heart attack, and a meeting takes place in which the members of the Football Association board must find a new manager to take them into the World Cup finals in Brazil. They are faced with problems in that the most successful Premier League manager is Scottish, the second most successful is too much of a \\"bigmouth\\" for the F.A.'s liking despite otherwise seeming perfect for the role, and all the other English managers in the Premier League come up with an increasingly ridiculous set of excuses to turn down the job. Still wanting to appoint an English manager, they look to the league below, Division One.As the press gather at Mike's house, he has no idea that they are there and unwittingly reveals himself (in polite terms) to them. As he speaks to them and says that he is not the England manager, his son Jason appears saying \\"Dad, you've got the England job.\\" Despite some recent bad results that caused the press to turn aggressively on Phil Cope, England are still theoretically in a strong position to qualify, and can make sure of it with either a single victory or avoiding defeat in their three remaining games.At his first meeting at Lancaster Gate (the home of English football) he is informed that he is allowed to pick his own assistant and coach.

Barack Obama speaks at a rally in Chicago, Illinois, after winning the presidency Tuesday night. \\"His goal was to be understood by the widest possible audience during his victory speech, and he seems to have done a great job doing it,\\" said Paul J.J. Payack, president of the Austin, Texas-based Global Language Monitor, which analyzed the speech for content, tone and length. \\"He's at his best communicating directly and forthrightly with this audience and using different types of rhetorical devices,\\" Payack said, noting that the speech was written to a seventh- or eighth-grade level. That's lower than the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech (grade 8.8), President Reagan's 1987 \\"Tear Down This Wall\\" speech (grade 9.8) and even Obama's own 2004 Democratic Convention speech (grade 8.3), Payack said. In the four years since then, \\"he has learned to speak more directly and more succinctly when he's giving a major address,\\" the word aficionado said. He spoke admiringly of Obama's repeated use of the phrase \\"Yes, we can,\\" calling it \\"very effective.\\" \\"That's a very short, direct sentence,\\" Payack said. \\"Almost like a drumbeat hammering into people's minds and hearts.\\" He added, \\"something like that comes across as a very effective rhetorical device.\\" That phrase compares with Reagan's \\"Tear Down This Wall\\" and President Kennedy's \\"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,\\" delivered in his inaugural speech. At about 2,000 words, the speech was short enough not to lose the audience's attention but long enough to cite specifics and cover the subject matter, Payack said. Watch Obama's victory speech ». Twelve of those words were \\"hope\\" or variations of the word, which indicates optimism about the change (used nine times) he has promised to effect. Another 23 of the words were \\"will,\\" another way of making the speech forward-looking. Though most of Obama's verbs were in the active voice, 11 percent of the sentences were in the passive voice, a dependable method of deflecting responsibility, Payack said. He cited Obama's \\"There will be setbacks and false starts\\" as an example. \\"He's spreading the responsibility around,\\" Payack said. \\"He didn't say, 'I will have setbacks. I will be wrong. I will make mistakes.' He used the passive voice for those types of constructions.\\" But the vast majority of the hopeful references were in the active voice, he said. \\"It's very personal and very active. 'I promise we, as a people, will get there.' \\" The speech was notable for what it omitted, too, Payack said. In this case, the absence of a reference to the September 11 terrorist attacks indicates a change in tone, he said. In his closing phrase, Obama repeats the mantra, \\"Yes, we can,\\" which serves as a call to action, an acknowledgment that the country faces hard work, Payack said. Obama is saying, \\"I'm asking you to do something big, but we can do it together,\\" Payack said. \\"We are the change; we are the hope.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article is talking about how good President-elect Barack Obama's victory speech was.

Paul Payack also said that Obama used a phrase, \\"Yes, we can,\\" that was really good at making people remember what he said.

But beyond the handshakes, casual strolls and shared asides, many analysts and experts are already wondering what exactly the enduring substance of the summit will be and whether it could boost Trump's political rating at home. For Trump, the great political disrupter, it was the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains.

(CNN) -- Professional basketball star Shaquille O'Neal paid for the funeral of a 5-year-old North Carolina girl whose body was found last week, O'Neal's team confirmed Thursday. Authorities believe the child, Shaniya Davis, was kidnapped, raped and murdered after being reported missing November 10. Her body was found six days later on a roadside about 30 miles from her hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina. Her funeral was Sunday. O'Neal said in a statement released by his team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, that he was touched after seeing Davis' story on CNN sister network HLN's \\"Nancy Grace\\" show. \\"What happened to her was tragic. I wanted her to have a funeral that would be as beautiful as she was,\\" O'Neal said in the statement.

The statement refers to the crime explaining that McNeill is being accused of kidnapping the child, and is expected to face further charges related to her murder and alleged rape. The other options do not make logical sense as they imply that entities like CNN, the Cleveland Cavaliers, or locations like Fayetteville, North Carolina would face such charges.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

Michael liked to go outside and play sports. Brandon on the other hand enjoyed reading and playing games on his computer.

Later, Savage reluctantly shares with Major General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, his belief that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his men and may no longer be fit to command. That night, Pritchard and Savage visit the group headquarters to investigate the cause of the mission's heavy losses. Pritchard realizes that Savage is right: Davenport has become over-protective and is unwilling to discipline his men even for costly mistakes.

Reports say the French National Front (FN) has received loans worth several million euros from a Russian bank. Russia remains under EU-US sanctions. The sanctions target Russian state banks, defence and energy industries, and close aides to President Vladimir Putin. They are expected to be renewed next month, to keep up pressure aimed at defusing the conflict in Ukraine. The West accuses Russia of helping the separatists in eastern Ukraine with soldiers and heavy weapons - something Russia denies. UKIP members, along with nationalists from France, Italy and some other countries, opposed the European Parliament resolution. The MEPs' votes were reported by the Votewatch Europe website. In the past, UKIP leader Nigel Farage has expressed some admiration for Mr Putin. Bulgarian Socialists also voted against the resolution. Russia maintains strong ties with Bulgaria, based on centuries-old shared culture and religion. In a comment on the vote, UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall said his party objected to any EU involvement in party funding. \\"UKIP does not support interference by the European Commission in any aspect of funding for British political parties.

The MEPs also accused Russia of \\"hybrid warfare, deliberately blurring the lines between military/paramilitary activity and political activism\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Information: - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Chamber pop (or \\"ork-pop\\") is a subgenre of indie pop or indie rock which grew in the mid 1990s as a reaction against the fuzz distortion and \\"lo-fi aesthetic\\" prominent in alternative music. Inspired partly by the era's lounge music revivalism, chamber pop is typified by the use of strings, horns, and piano, and a dissociation from contemporary genres of the time, like grunge or electronica. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heavily influenced much of the genre, as did composer Burt Bacharach. Specific works which helped define chamber pop include the Beach Boys' albums \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) and \\"Smile\\" (196667), as well as the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records (198489). - Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie pop current. - Athens (formally known as Athens-Clarke County) is a consolidated citycounty in the U.S. state of Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state, comprising the former city of Athens proper (the county seat) and Clarke County. The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County. As of the 2010 census, the consolidated city-county (including all of Athens-Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) had a total population of 115,452; all of Clarke County had a population of 116,714. Athens is the sixth-largest city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 192,541 as of the 2010 census. Athens-Clarke County has the smallest geographical area of a county in Georgia. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack. - Masters of the Hemisphere is the first full album by the Athens , Georgia based indie pop band of the same name . Though it lacks the elaborateness of their followup , the heavily concept - based I Am Not A Freemdoom , it still maintains the essential element of the band 's indie pop songcraft , drawing comparisons to R.E.M. , among others . - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop. - Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes. - Masters of the Hemisphere are an American indie pop group, founded by Bren Mead and Sean Rawls. The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996. There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show. Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis. In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \\"Going on a Trek to Iceland\\". The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \\"Masters of the Hemisphere\\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998. The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch. Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \\"I Am Not a Freemdoom\\", also on Kindercore. The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog. The \\"Permanent Stranger\\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label. The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \\"Protest a Dark Anniversary\\". A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \\"The Last Show Ever\\". Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'record label'. The answer is:","completion":"Subject entity: Kindercore Records Object entities: Masters of the Hemisphere"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"Perhaps one day we'll even achieve that.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"One day it is possible we achieve that.\\"? Possible answers: -yes -it is not possible to tell -no","completion":"Yes, if the premise \\"Perhaps one day we'll even achieve that\\" is true, it entails the hypothesis \\"One day it is possible we achieve that.\\" The reason for this is that the premise itself suggests the possibility of accomplishing the particular objective or goal in question. Analyzing the premise, \\"perhaps\\" indicates uncertainty but also the existence of an opportunity to achieve something. \\"One day\\" implies that it may be achieved in the future, even if such a time is unspecified. \\"We'll even achieve that\\" means there exists a specific task, goal, or accomplishment that the speaker is talking about. Taken together, the entire premise implies a non-zero probability of success in achieving the discussed objective at some point in the future. Drawing from the premise, the hypothesis \\"One day it is possible we achieve that\\" logically follows. In fact, the hypothesis and the premise are very closely related. It emphasizes that there's potential to achieve the given task in the future without making any definitive claims about when it will happen. The hypothesis simply reiterates the idea of possibility already present in the original premise. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"Perhaps one day we'll even achieve that,\\" it is accurate to assume the hypothesis \\"One day it is possible we achieve that\\" to be true. Both the premise and the hypothesis acknowledge the potential for success in the future without providing a fixed time frame for that accomplishment. Therefore, the correct answer is \\"yes,\\" as the premise entails the given hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Pick from: [i] not enough information. [ii] Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US.. [iii] It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians.. [iv] Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control.. A:","completion":"The politics regarding gun rights in the US are likely heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. This is evident from the various opinions expressed by different groups, such as the Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day campaign, which has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians, and celebrities, but rejected by gun rights advocates such as the National Rifle Association. The different views on gun ownership and control demonstrate that the politics surrounding this issue are indeed highly contentious and polarizing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bill 's Cathy Stoller Center is home to all University athletics teams , the Intercollegiate Athletic Offices and the Department of Exercise Science .","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the structure and content of both sentences. In the first sentence, the structure is as follows: - The Bill's Cathy Stoller Center is home to: a. all intercollegiate athletic teams from the university b. sports offices c. the Department of Exercise Science In the second sentence, the structure is as follows: - The Bill's Cathy Stoller Center is home to: a. all University athletics teams b. the Intercollegiate Athletic Offices c. the Department of Exercise Science Step 2: Compare the content and meaning of both sentences. Overall, both sentences convey a similar meaning: The Bill's Cathy Stoller Center houses athletic teams, certain offices, and the Department of Exercise Science. However, there are slight differences in the specific elements mentioned within each sentence: 1. In the first sentence, \\"all intercollegiate athletic teams\\" are mentioned, while the second sentence refers to \\"all University athletics teams.\\" This difference does not change the meaning significantly, as \\"intercollegiate athletic teams\\" can be understood as the university's athletic teams. However, the second sentence is more general by mentioning \\"all University athletics teams.\\" 2. In the first sentence, \\"sports offices\\" are mentioned, while the second sentence refers to \\"the Intercollegiate Athletic Offices.\\" This difference is also minor, as both terms possibly refer to the same entity, but the second sentence is more specific about the type of offices. Step 3: Evaluate if both sentences mean the same. The two sentences have similar meaning but contain minor differences in detail. As a result, they can be considered roughly equivalent, but not exactly the same. The second sentence is more specific in the type of offices and more general in the mention of athletic teams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The first draft of the Convention included political killings, but these provisions were removed in a political and diplomatic compromise following objections from some countries, including the USSR, a permanent security council member. The USSR argued that the Convention's definition should follow the etymology of the term, and may have feared greater international scrutiny of its own Great Purge. Other nations feared that including political groups in the definition would invite international intervention in domestic politics. However leading genocide scholar William Schabas states: “Rigorous examination of the travaux fails to confirm a popular impression in the literature that the opposition to inclusion of political genocide was some Soviet machination. The Soviet views were also shared by a number of other States for whom it is difficult to establish any geographic or social common denominator: Lebanon, Sweden, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Iran, Egypt, Belgium, and Uruguay. The exclusion of political groups was in fact originally promoted by a non-governmental organization, the World Jewish Congress, and it corresponded to Raphael Lemkin’s vision of the nature of the crime of genocide.” Question: What was the primary concern of other nations who objected to including political groups in the definition of genocide?","completion":"The primary concern of other nations who objected to including political groups in the definition of genocide was the potential invitation of international intervention in domestic politics. These nations feared that by encompassing political groups in the definition, it would create a gateway for external forces to interfere in their internal affairs, infringing upon their sovereignty and potentially destabilizing their political systems. This hesitance to include political killings within the scope of genocide was driven by various countries' desire to preserve their autonomy and maintain control over their own political landscape, rather than having external entities dictate or judge their actions."},{"prompt":"In this task, you will be given a short story.

Article: A group inspired by the running of the bulls in Pamplona is planning to unleash bulls in several U.S. cities to sprint through fenced-in courses as daredevils try to avoid being trampled. The Great Bull Run is set to kick off Aug. 24 at a drag-racing strip south of Richmond, Virginia. A second event is planned for Oct. 19 at an Atlanta-area horse park that hosted events for the 1996 Olympics. More events are planned later for Texas, Florida, California, Minnesota, Illinois and Pennsylvania. Bull runs _ when the animals are released to run alongside participants as spectators cheer _ are common in Spain and can drum up controversy. Injuries often occur, as do deaths, though they are much rarer. Some groups attack the treatment of the bulls used in the runs. About 5,000 people have signed up to participate in the Virginia event, and the number grows by about 50 each day, said Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of The Great Bull Run. And with 2,000 signed up for the Conyers, Georgia, event, Dickens expects 5,000 to 7,000 to run there in October. The U.S. events will last one day each, unlike the annual weeklong festival in Pamplona, when bull runs are held every morning. Author Ernest Hemingway wrote about the festival in his 1926 novel \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" which helped it gain worldwide notoriety and attract spectators from around the globe. Organizers acknowledge that the Great Bull Run is likely to start out on a smaller scale than its Spanish counterpart. But they note that other physically challenging activities such as extreme off-road runs and obstacle races have become increasingly popular in the U.S., and they see bull running as a natural follow-up. \\"I think it's just a progression where we are becoming more and more active as a society,\\" Dickens said. \\"There's this fitness craze that started with running. I think this is just an extension of all that, but making it more interesting to the general public.\\" Dozens of people are injured each year in the San Fermin festival at Pamplona, most by tripping and falling. Bulls have killed 15 people since record-keeping began in 1924. Last month in Spain, a University of Utah college student and an Australian woman were gored by bulls. During one run, participants and spectators screamed as a bull tossed a Spaniard to the ground and attacked him, with fellow runners trying to pull the animal away by its tail. The man was eventually dragged to safety. Organizers of the U.S. events plan to include several safety features, making them \\"quite different than the running of the bulls in Spain,\\" Dickens said. Unlike the narrow, cobblestone streets of the Spanish runs, the U.S. events will use fencing that will include coves, or notches, so participants can get out of the way quickly. Dickens said organizers are partnering with ranches who will supply the bulls, and veterinarians will monitor their health. \\"We're not using the Spanish fighting bulls that are bred to be very aggressive for the entertaining aspect of bullfighting,\\" Dickens said. Bulls will be released in waves of six at a time, giving the animals and people a \\"better opportunity to complete the course safely,\\" Dickens said. Before running, participants will be required to sign waivers. Dickens, an attorney, acknowledges that waivers won't prevent lawsuits but likened it to sky-diving or operating a rock-climbing wall: \\"The waivers for the most part ensure that even if you get sued, they're not going to win.\\" Researchers are still trying to figure out why some people are drawn to potentially dangerous activities. One theory is that some people get a surge from routine activities, but others need more thrilling or exciting behaviors to get the same feeling, said Dr. Jonathan Becker, assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \\"To get that same sort of euphoric feeling that you feel at the end of a jog, they may need to jog with bulls for example,\\" Becker said. Organizers say they're planning each U.S. event as an all-day experience, with plenty of activities such as a tomato fight, also modeled after a Spanish festival. But they hope the bull runs draw participants who have always wanted to participate but couldn't make the trip to Spain. \\"You can go running down the street anytime you want, but to run with bulls _ that's something that doesn't come along very often,\\" Dickens said. ___ Felberbaum reported from Richmond, Virginia. ||||| Thousands of daredevils have already signed up to sprint alongside bulls when The Great Bull Run comes to the U.S. this August.

Dozens of people are injured each year in the San Fermin festival at Pamplona Watch out! The Great Bull Run is coming to the U.S. Organizers of the Pamplona-inspired event plan for several U.S. cities to unleash bulls to sprint through fenced-in courses as daredevils sprint to avoid being trampled. The inaugural run is set for Aug. 24 in Richmond, Va. More events are planned for Georgia, Texas, Florida, California, Minnesota, Illinois and Pennsylvania. Bull runs — when the animals are released to run alongside participants as spectators cheer — are common in Spain and have proved to be dangerous. Dozens of people are injured each year in the San Fermin festival at Pamplona, most by tripping and falling. Bulls have killed 15 people since record keeping began in 1924. \\"By participating in the run, you accept the risk that you might be trampled, gored, rammed or tossed in the air by a bull, or bumped, jostled, tripped or trampled by your fellow runners,\\" the event website states. \\"We do what we can to minimize those risks by using less-aggressive bulls than those used in Spain and allowing runners to hide in nooks and climb over the track fence if necessary, but make no mistake: You could get seriously injured in this event.\\" About 5,000 people have signed up to participate in the Virginia event, and the number grows by about 50 each day, Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of The Great Bull Run, told the Associated Press. And with 2,000 already signed up for the Conyers, Ga., event, Dickens expects 5,000 to 7,000 to run there in October. Bull runs have long been controversial. Some animal rights groups raise concerns over the treatment of the bulls. \\"These events are a shameful example of cruelty for the sake of nothing more than entertainment and profit,\\" Ann Chynoweth, senior director of The Humane Society of the United States' End Animal Fighting & Cruelty Campaign, told the AP. \\"These companies put the health and safety of both humans and animals at risk, without the required federal oversight. We call on the USDA to investigate these entities immediately.\\" Organizers at the Great Bull Run say they are \\"wholly committed to the health and safety of the animals we work with.\\" \\"Unlike the running of the bulls in Spain, we don't kill the bulls in a bullfight, nor do we abuse them in anyway,\\" organizers state on the event website. \\"We don't hit them, shock them or deprive them of food, water, light or sleep. In fact, we have a veterinarian on site at all times to make sure the bulls are treated properly and are perfectly healthy before, during and after each run.\\" Organizers of the U.S. events plan to include several safety features, making them \\"quite different than the running of the bulls in Spain,\\" Dickens said. Unlike the narrow, cobblestone streets of the Spanish runs, the U.S. events will use fencing that will include coves, or notches, so participants can get out of the way quickly.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Instructions: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. You need to come up with a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph. The generated question should not be answerable without both the background and story. Write a question about the story that requires a relationship in the background paragraph to answer. Check whether your question requires both the background paragraph and the story to answer. If your question can be answered by only one of these, try to rewrite your question so that it requires both. Note that \\"flipping\\" a word in the question can give rise to a new question where the answer will be different from the original question. Often, \\"flipping\\" a word gives rise to flipping the direction of the relationship, for example, from \\"increase\\" to \\"decrease.\\" Input: Background Paragraph: People protect areas that might flood with dams. In dire situations, they use sandbags ( Figure below ). Dams are usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to break. In that case, flooding can be catastrophic. Flood waters can also overflow a dam. People may line a river bank with levees to protect against floods. These are high walls that keep the stream within its banks during floods. Flood protection in one location sometimes causes problems elsewhere. For example, a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream. This will lead to flooding in a different location. Sometimes water gets so high that the river must be allowed to flood. Story: There are two neighboring towns in the middle of the United States with a river running through both of them. One town, Glenview, just installed a new set of levees due to concerns about the river flooding. The other town, Binnington, is located just upstream from Glenview and has not yet installed any flood protection. Output:","completion":"Question: After Glenview installed the new set of levees, what might be the impact on flooding in the upstream town of Binnington, if the river water level rises significantly? Explanation: To answer this question, one must understand the causal relationship mentioned in the background paragraph, which is that \\"a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream\\" and the story, which tells us about two towns: Glenview (with newly installed levees) and Binnington (without flood protection). The question requires the understanding of the relationship between levees and the potential redistribution of high waters to answer how Binnington might be affected by the flood protection installed in Glenview."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Using the definition of \\"favor\\" as a kind act or assistance provided out of goodwill, and considering the prototypical situation of friendship where friends help and support each other, offering a ride to the airport is a common and helpful favor.

Build a movie plot around this: What does the homeless man who follows Brad demand? Two dollars The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: \\"Two-Dollar Destiny\\" Step 1: Establish Setting and Main Characters The movie is set primarily in a large city in the United States. Brad, a successful businessman, is our main character. He is a workaholic and initially lacks empathy for others. A key secondary character is Mark, the homeless man who follows Brad. Step 2: Introduce Conflict One day, Brad encounters Mark, a homeless man in his mid-30s who appears to be suffering from mental health issues. Mark approaches Brad and demands two dollars. At first, Brad dismisses the man, wanting nothing to do with him. Step 3: Build Tension Despite Brad's initial dismissal, Mark begins to follow him around the city. Mark's persistence attempts to get the two dollars from Brad piques Brad's interest, making him wonder why this specific amount is so important to the homeless man. This, in turn, leads Brad to develop a strange fascination with Mark, prompting him to observe the man and his daily routine. Step 4: Connection between Characters As Brad spends more time watching Mark, he begins to learn about the homeless man's tragic past. Once a struggling artist, Mark lost his family, home, and career after a series of unfortunate events. The two dollars he seeks from Brad is a symbol of the last artwork he sold before his life spiraled out of control – it had been priced at just two dollars. Step 5: Transformative Experience Brad's newfound understanding of Mark's story prompts him to reevaluate his own life and priorities. Witnessing the hardships faced by Mark, Brad starts to develop empathy and compassion for others, including those less fortunate. Step 6: Climax One day, while following Mark, Brad watches as Mark is confronted by a group of violent thugs. Noticing the situation escalating, Brad steps in to assist Mark and fights off the attackers. In the aftermath, Mark reveals that the persistence in asking for two dollars was not about the money, but rather about finding someone who genuinely cared enough to help him, regardless of his circumstance. Step 7: Resolution Deeply moved by Mark's story and their shared experience, Brad decides to give Mark the two dollars, acknowledging the significance of the gesture. However, he goes a step further and offers Mark a job at his company as well, determined to help the homeless man rebuild his life. Brad's involvement with Mark and the impact it has on his life inspire him to dedicate more time and resources to improving the lives of the less fortunate in the city. Step 8: Closing The film concludes with a scene showing Brad and Mark, now good friends and coworkers, organizing a charity event to benefit the homeless. Brad's personal growth culminates in a heartfelt speech, in which he expresses gratitude to Mark for teaching him the importance of compassion and empathy. Ultimately, the answer to the question \\"What does the homeless man who follows Brad demand?\\" is not just \\"Two dollars,\\" but also a life-changing relationship that transforms the lives of both men."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

The son of a physician, Kunstler was born in New York City and attended DeWitt Clinton High School. He was educated at Yale College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1941, and Columbia University Law School from which he graduated in 1948. While in school, Kunstler was an avid poet and represented Yale in the Glascock Prize competition at Mount Holyoke College. Kunstler served in the U.S. Army during World War II in the Pacific theater, attaining the rank of Major, and received the Bronze Star. In 1974-1975, Kunstler defended a prisoner charged with killing a guard during the Attica Prison riot. Under cross-examination, Kunstler forced Correction Officer Donald Melven to retract his sworn identification of John Hill, Kunstler's client, and Charles Pernasilice (defended by Richard Miller), admitting he still retained \\"slight\\" doubts that he confessed to investigators at the time of the incident. Kunstler focused on pointing out that all the other prosecution witnesses were testifying under reduced-sentencing agreements and called five prison inmates as defense witnesses (Miller called none), who testified that other prisoners hit the guard. Despite Justice King's repeated warnings to Kunstler to \\"be careful, sir\\", Kunstler quickly became \\"the star of the trial, the man the jurors watch most attentively, and the lawyer whose voice carries most forcefully\\". Although the prosecution was careful to avoid personal confrontation with Kunstler, who frequently charmed the jury with jokes, on one occasion Kunstler provoked a shouting match with the lead prosecutor, allegedly to wake up a sleeping jury member. The jury convicted Hill of murder and Pernasilice of attempted assault. When Kunstler protested that the defendants would risk being murdered due to the judges remanding them, King threatened to send Kunstler with them. New York Governor Hugh Carey granted executive clemency to Hill and the other inmates in 1976, even though Hill's name was not on the recommended list of pardons delivered to the governor and his appeals were still pending. In June, Kunstler and Barbara Handshu, representing another inmate at Attica, Mariano Gonzales, asked for a new hearing on the role of FBI informant Mary Jo Cook.

'As one of Big Change’s Trustees, some of you have been asking why I’m now not taking part in the Virgin STRIVE Challenge myself. 'Well, Freddie and I are delighted to share the happy news that we are expecting twins!'. She continued: 'After telling our families and all of the Virgin family too, we thought it was time to let everyone know - plus I don’t want anybody thinking I wasn’t up for the challenge of doing Strive!!

She. wasn't going to let that stop her holding her big day there and said. getting married on the remains added a special aspect to the ceremony. Talking to Hello! magazine, she said: 'Because it is such a dramatic environment, you don't get a sad feeling. on the ruins, it's more of an uplifting, wow, a feeling of celebration. and a time to reflect. 'Before, we were wondering where to fit that many people to have a. proper service, but it was the most obvious big flat open space, it was. perfect. 'It's definitely our special place and it looked absolutely beautiful,. even thought it was still very rustic - there are still piles of rubble -. it was dramatic. And it's stunning because you're at the top of a hill. so there are incredible panoramic views.' Explanation: Writing on Virgin.com, she explained that she wouldn't be taking part in the Virgin Strive Challenge because of her pregnancy. Grandfather Richard: Sir Branson, pictured with newborn son Sam and daughter Holly in 1986, encouraged Holly's pregnancy. Clearly the place is. special; in the tweet announcing her pregnancy news, she and Freddie can. be seen posing on a hill on Necker Island. At the time of her wedding, Holly said: 'He was really keen for. me to be pregnant walking down the aisle. He didn't think we should. worry about being married first. 'My parents weren't married before they. had Sam and I, but both had been married before and it didn't work, so I. think for us, it's nice to do everything in the right order.' Will she be godmother?

Tight City Council races: Veteran aldermen head for runoffs UPDATED at 9:43 p.m. Posted by Hal Dardick and John Byrne at 7:10 p.m.; check back for updates on results. City Council incumbents in several wards were beating back challenges tonight but at least two longtime aldermen appeared headed for April runoff elections. Ald. Sandi Jackson, 7th, who faced questions about how much time she spends in Washington D.C. with her children and husband, U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., had about 53 percent of the vote with 97 percent of precincts reporting in her Southeast Side ward. And Ald. George Cardenas, 12th, held a comfortable lead with 55 percent of the vote and all precincts in the ward reporting unofficial results, despite challenges from opponents backed by state Sen. Tony Munoz and Ald. Ricardo Munoz, 22nd. Ald. Scott Waguespack, 32nd, a frequent Daley critic in his first re-election race, collected 66 percent of the vote in his North Side ward against three challengers, with all precincts counted, according to unofficial results. And Ald. Robert Fioretti, 2nd, held 55 percent of the vote with 95 percent of precincts reporting as he tried to fend off attorney Genita Robinson and four others in the ward, which extends west from the South Loop well into the West Side Perhaps the biggest potential upset of the evening was in the 47th Ward on the Northwest Side, where longtime Ald. Eugene Schulter pulled out of the race at the last minute and threw his support behind ally Tom O’Donnell. With 94 percent of the vote counted, Ameya Pawar was just above the 50 percent mark. O’Donnell had 44 percent of the vote. The election was guaranteed to change City Council, even before the results of today's voting were reported. Nine of the 50 current aldermen were not on the ballot. In six wards, aldermen appointed by Mayor Richard Daley in the past 19 months were running in their first council election. More than half a dozen other aldermen faced serious challenges. One of the most hotly fought contests was in the 50th Ward on the far North Side, where Bernard Stone, the city’s second-longest serving alderman, faced an intense challenge from Debra Silverstein, a CPA, political worker and neighborhood volunteer who is the wife of the ward’s Democratic committeeman. Stone won by less than 700 votes four years ago in a runoff contest, and the next year Sen. Silverstein beat him in the committeeman’s contest. Since then, two of Stone’s political workers went to jail for trying to manipulate ballots. Lawyer Michael Moses, architect Greg Brewer and Ahmed Khan, whose family owns a popular local grocery store, rounded out the field. With more than 70 percent of the vote counted, Stone had about 38 percent of the vote, and Silverstein had about 33 percent. The other candidates had a total of about 30 percent, but all were well behind the two leaders. At campaign headquarters, Stone sat quietly at a long table signing volunteer work slips while his employees milled about yelling into cell phones. \\"I'm leading\\" Stone said. \\"So there's no question I'm in the runoff.\\"Despite his optimism, however, Stone acknowledged that it had been \\"a long day.\\"\\"We haven't reached the 50 percent mark yet, but we keep moving up,\\" said Stone, who was dressed in a gray suit and pink tie. \\"The only thing is, of course, there's more candidates and that makes it tougher.\\" Stoned added that turnout so far appeared to be lower than it was in 2007. City election officials predicted turnout from 40 to 45 percent, and aldermen said they were seeing similar numbers. To win outright on Tuesday, a candidate had to capture more than half the overall vote. In wards where no one got the outright majority, runoff elections between the two candidates with the most votes will be held April 5. The make-up of the new council and the inevitable jockeying for leadership posts will help create a new power equation at City Hall, which has long been dominated by outgoing Mayor Richard Daley. For more than two decades Daley has had an iron grip on the council and won easy passage of his initiatives, leaving aldermen to tinker around the edges of governance.But aldermen have considerable muscle to flex, if they choose to do so. They pass laws, vote on the city’s 6 billion-plus budget and have final say on all major appointments, including the key post of police superintendent.Unions, other political power players and the pro-business group, For a Better Chicago, have in recent weeks poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into council races. Another incumbent under heavy fire was Sharon Denise Dixon, 24th of the West Side, who faced 17 challengers, including former Ald. Michael Chandler. In the 7th Ward, Jackson was one of five sitting aldermen being challenged by the sons or daughters of former aldermen. Jackson declared victory over Darcel Beavers, the daughter of Cook County Commissioner William Beavers, was hoping to turn the tables on Jackson after losing to her in 2007. \\"This really was a very, very hard fought campaign, you all,\\" Jackson said, addressing more than 50 campaign volunteers and supporters at her headquarters in the 7100 block of South Exchange Avenue. \\"But tonight, the people of the 7th Ward have spoken.\\" In the 25th Ward, influential Ald. Daniel Solis was being challenged by Ambrosio “Ambi” Medrano Jr., the son of a former alderman sent to prison for public corruption, and Cuahutemoc Morfin, vice president of a Pilsen chamber of commerce. In the South Side's 6th Ward, Roderick Sawyer, the son Eugene Sawyer, who was elevated from alderman to mayor after the death in office of Harold Washington, was taking on Ald. Freddrenna Lyle. With about 78 percent of the vote counted, Lyle was leading the pack, but falling short of the majority e needed to avoid a runoff. She had 44 percent of the vote, to 25 percent for Sawyer, with the other three candidates in that contest far behind. Also on the South Side, Ald. Pat Dowell, 3rd, was being challenged by Ebony Tillman, the daughter of former Ald. Dorothy Tillman. Ald. Howard Brookins Jr., 21st, the son of a state senatorbest known for his successful battle to get a Walmart approved for his South Side ward, is being challenged by Sheldon Sherman, the son of former Ald. Niles Sherman, and three other people.One of the most highly publicized races was in the 20th Ward, where freshman Ald. Willie Cochran, a former police officer, was being challenged by Che “Rhymefest” Smith, a rap artist, attorney George Davis and two others. Cochran jumped out to an early lead. With 44 percent of precincts reporting, Cochran had 45 percent of the vote, to 20 percent for Che Smith. First-term Ald. Robert Fioretti, 2nd, who represents an area that extends from the South Loop well into the West Side, faced a spirited challenge from attorney Genita Robinson, who runs a youth tutoring and mentoring program, and four other candidates. Ald. Scott Waguespack, 32nd, who has developed a reputation for independence during his first term, was being challenged by three other men who had ties to regular Democrats. Meanwhile, Ald. George Cardenas, 12th, faced Jose Guereca, who had the backing of former Cardenas ally Sen. Tony Munoz, and Jesus “Jesse” Iniguez, who was backed by Ald. Ricardo Munoz, 22nd. Three others were in the contest. In one of the hardest fought open races, to replace outgoing Ald. Vi Daley, 43rd, Michele Smith, the ward’s Democratic committeeman, and Tim Egan, a hospital executive, were among nine candidates trying to represent Lincoln Park.In the North Side 47th Ward, Tom O'Donnell, an ally of longtime alderman Eugene Schulter, finds himself in a tight race. With 79 percent of precincts reporting, O'Donnell, who launched his campaign late last year as Schulter dropped out at the last minute, found himself with just 44 percent of the vote. He trailed Ameya Pawar, 30, a program assistant in Northwestern University's Office of Emergency Management, who had 50.3 percent of the total. The 46th Ward, where longtime Ald. Helen Shiller is calling it quits, had 11 candidates. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about City Council elections in different wards.

(b). yes.","completion":"There are multiple factors that prevent a group of well-intentioned billionaires from pouring €10B into Greece's banks to save the country and Greeks from financial collapse. Here are some of the key reasons: 1. Legal restrictions: International financial regulations, as well as regulatory laws in respective billionaires' countries, may limit the transfer of such large sums of money into another country's banks. These regulations are in place to curb money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit financial activities. 2. Moral hazard: Introducing a large sum of money to a country's banks to alleviate financial collapse could inadvertently encourage riskier behavior in the future. Banks may take more risks, knowing that they may be bailed out by outside sources if a crisis occurs again. 3. Economic repercussions: Injecting €10B into Greece's banks could lead to inflation, as the country experiences a sudden influx of money. This could hurt the overall economic situation in the country and be counterproductive to the intended goal of stabilizing Greece's financial condition. 4. Political considerations: A large influx of money from private individuals could create or perpetuate the idea of dependence on external forces for financial stability. This could lead to political disagreements within Greece and potential resentment toward the donating billionaires, as their actions could be perceived as interfering with Greece's autonomy. 5. Return on investment: Billionaires would likely consider the potential return on investment (ROI) before deciding to inject funds into Greece's banks. It may not be an appealing investment opportunity if the overall financial condition of the country is unstable, as the chances of getting a substantial ROI could be low. Regarding your second question about taking a mortgage on your house in a Greek bank hoping for a Grexit, there are several issues to consider: 1. Risk: Taking a mortgage from a Greek bank involves a high degree of risk, especially considering the unstable financial environment in Greece. This may not be a wise financial decision, as there is no guarantee of a Grexit, and the potential consequences could have a lasting negative impact on your finances. 2. International regulations: There are likely regulations and policies in place that govern international mortgages, which could make it difficult or impossible for you to secure a mortgage with a Greek bank while residing in Belgium. 3. Cross-border complexities: Securing a mortgage in a foreign country can be complicated due to differences in regulations, legal systems, and consumer protection laws. This may increase the financial burden and complexity of managing the mortgage, as well as the overall risks associated with your investment. In conclusion, these two questions are not the same. The first question deals with the potential actions of a group of billionaires that could potentially save Greece from financial collapse. The second question focuses on an individual seeking a mortgage from a Greek bank, possibly hoping to gain an advantage in the event of Greece's exit from the European Union. Therefore, the correct answer to your multi-choice problem is (a) no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

When criminal mastermind Erwin \\"Doc\\" Riedenschneider is released from prison after seven years, he goes to see a bookie named Cobby in an unnamed Midwest river city (probably Cincinnati), who arranges a meeting with Alonzo Emmerich, a lawyer. Emmerich listens to Doc's plan to steal jewelry worth half a million dollars or more. Doc needs 50,000 to hire three men—a \\"box man\\" (safecracker), a driver, and a \\"hooligan\\"—to help him pull off the caper. Emmerich agrees to provide the money and assume the responsibility for disposing of the loot. Doc hires Louie Ciavelli, a professional safecracker. Ciavelli only trusts Gus Minissi, a hunchbacked diner owner, as the getaway driver. The final member of the gang is Dix Handley, a friend of Gus. Dix explains his goal to Doll Conovan, who is in love with him. His dream is to buy back the horse farm that his father lost during the Great Depression. During the crime (an 11-minute sequence in the film), the criminals carry out their work. Ciavelli hammers through a brick wall to get into the jewelry store, deactivates a door alarm to let in Doc and Dix, and opens the main safe using home-brewed nitroglycerine (\\"the soup\\"). On their way out, Dix slugs an arriving security guard, who drops his revolver, which discharges and wounds Ciavelli in the belly. The men get away unseen, but a police manhunt begins. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Dix Handley wants to buy a horse farm.

Argentina remains one of 17 countries still banning British cattle for breeding because of the outbreak of mad cow disease in 1980s. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Refusal of Argentina to buy cattle created new tensions between the two countries.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it cannot be definitively concluded that the \\"refusal of Argentina to buy cattle created new tensions between the two countries.\\" The paragraph only states that Argentina is one among the 17 countries that still ban British cattle for breeding due to the outbreak of mad cow disease in the 1980s. It does not provide any direct evidence of new tensions arising from this specific ban. While it is entirely possible that there may be some discontent or disagreement between Argentina and the United Kingdom due to the ban on British cattle for breeding, it is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. This ban might be just one of the many factors influencing the relations between these nations, and it would be necessary to obtain further information to evaluate the impact of this decision on their relationship. Moreover, it is important to consider that the ban on British cattle stems from legitimate health concerns linked to the mad cow disease outbreak. Mad cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in cattle that can be transmitted to humans, causing a severe and eventually lethal condition known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Argentina, as a sovereign country, has the right to apply precautionary measures, such as the ban in question, to safeguard its people's health and its domestic livestock industry. Furthermore, trade partnerships between nations are multifaceted, and it is likely that Argentina and the United Kingdom engage in several other forms of economic and diplomatic cooperation. While the ban on British cattle for breeding may cause some strain between the two countries, it is also important to examine the extent to which the other aspects of their bilateral relations balance and potentially mitigate the impact of that disagreement. In conclusion, the paragraph only provides information about Argentina's continued ban on British cattle for breeding due to the mad cow disease outbreak. It does not establish a clear link between this ban and the emergence of new tensions between Argentina and the United Kingdom. For a more accurate assessment, it would be necessary to gather more information on the context surrounding this ban as well as any recent changes or incidents related to the two countries' political, economic, and diplomatic relations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Items are collected - The items are sorted - Trash is removed from everything else - Goes to a landfill - The items go into a baler machine for each kind of material - They come out as bales - The bales are shipped to manufacturers to use to make products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More plant roots grow into the rock happens, how will it affect MORE recyling. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the supposed perturbation of \\"More plant roots grow into the rock\\" would not have a direct or indirect effect on the recycling process described. Here's how I reason this: Step-by-step: 1. First, let's understand the given process. It involves collecting items, sorting them, removing trash, sending it to a landfill, processing the rest through a baler machine, forming them into bales, and shipping them to manufacturers. 2. Now, let's define the perturbation hypothesis: \\"More plant roots grow into the rock.\\" This is a biological and geological event implying that increase in vegetation or an increase in plant root penetration into the soil or rock layers. 3. The next step is to check if this perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the described recycling process. To impact the recycling process, the perturbation would need to affect one or more steps of the process. 4. However, an increase in plant roots growing into the rock is predominantly associated with land management, ecology, and geology. It's hard to see a plausible connection between this and the item collection, processing, or shipping activities in the recycling process. 5. Even in an indirect perspective, unless the growth of plant roots into the rock would somehow lead to an increased production of recyclable waste or affect the infrastructure used for recycling, it's hard to envision a connection. And these would be highly indirect and speculative at best. Therefore, based on these steps and the provided information, we can reason the perturbation proposed does not realistically impact the process of recycling as described. Therefore, it will not affect the outcome of 'MORE recycling'. Meaning the perturbation hypothesis of \\"More plant roots grow into the rock\\" would in general not lead to more recycling, considering the steps identified."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This political party was different from the others because they truly cared about the people and what they were going through. You see, Greece was going through a very difficult time. They had what's called an \\"economic crisis.\\" This means that many people didn't have jobs, and they didn't have enough money to buy the things they needed. Lots of people were very sad and worried about their future. But Syriza wanted to help. They saw that the people needed someone to understand what they were going through, and they wanted to make things better for everyone. Syriza listened to the people's problems and worked hard to fix them. A man named Manos, who was 32 years old, explained why Syriza was different from other political parties. He said that Syriza was successful because they understood what was happening in society. That means they knew what people were worried about and were able to help them out. Syriza also managed to connect with the people. They talked to many people from different walks of life and listened to their stories. They made the people feel important and heard, which is something that not all political parties are good at doing. Because of their caring and understanding ways, Syriza was able to gain the trust of the people. The people saw that this party was different, and they believed that Syriza could help them during the difficult time in Greece. So, as the economic crisis continued, Syriza became more and more popular. People believed in them and wanted them to be in charge. That's how Syriza found success during the economic crisis. In conclusion, Syriza was a special political party that managed to connect with the people during a tough time. They listened to the problems of the people in Greece and worked hard to make things better. Their understanding and caring ways made them successful during the economic crisis. And that's how Syriza's story teaches us the importance of listening and being kind to others, even in the hardest of times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a summary based on this article: George Zimmerman can be released on 150,000 bail as he awaits trial for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a judge ruled Friday during a hearing that saw Zimmerman apologize to Martin's parents for the teenager's death. FILE - In this Thursday, April 12, 2012 file photo, George Zimmerman, right, stands next to a Seminole County Deputy during a court hearing in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer... (Associated Press) Tracy Martin, left, and Sybrina Fulton, parents of slain teen Trayvon Martin, speak to each other during a public town hall meeting with legal experts and political leaders on Thursday, April 19, 2012,... (Associated Press) Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester set several conditions Friday for Zimmerman's release, which he said would not occur Friday, but he did not say when exactly Zimmerman could go free. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, also wants his client to be allowed to live in another state because of threats made against him, and wear a GPS monitor to track his whereabouts. Wearing a charcoal suit, white shirt and gray tie _ but also shackled and appearing to have on a bulletproof vest _ Zimmerman took the witness stand to deliver a short statement to Martin's parents, who were there. \\"I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son. I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit younger than I am. I did not know if he was armed or not,\\" Zimmerman said in his first public comments about the shooting. The judge said he would hold another hearing on whether Zimmerman could go out of state if details could not be worked out with law enforcement. Zimmerman cannot have any firearms, drink alcohol or use illegal drugs and must observe a curfew between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. Zimmerman surrendered his passport at the start of the hearing. Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder in the Feb. 26 shooting of the 17-year-old Martin. He claims self-defense and has said Martin was the aggressor in their confrontation at a gated community where Martin was staying. Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch volunteer at the community, where he also lived. The lack of an arrest for 44 days spurred protests nationwide in which participants chanted and held signs that said, \\"Arrest Zimmerman Now!\\" Anger over a delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to the Sanford police chief stepping down temporarily and the recusal of the prosecutor who normally handles cases out of Sanford. Earlier, Zimmerman's parents and wife testified by phone in the hearing at the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center, saying he is not a flight risk nor a threat to the community. Zimmerman's family members were testifying by phone because they say they have been threatened. \\"He is absolutely not a violent person,\\" his wife, Shellie Zimmerman, testified. Zimmerman's father, George Zimmerman Sr., said that even when confronted his son was likely to \\"turn the other cheek.\\" The father also described what he said were his son's injuries Feb. 27, the morning after Martin was shot and killed. \\"His face was swollen quite a bit. He had a protective cover over his nose. His lip was swollen and cut. And there were two vertical gashes on the back of his head,\\" the elder Zimmerman testified. Zimmerman's mother, Gladys, said her son was \\"very protective\\" of vulnerable people such as the homeless and children. She described how he got involved in a mentoring program for children in Orlando, noting that both of the children he mentored were African-American like Martin. Gladys Zimmerman said she was concerned about her son's safety in that program because he traveled twice a month to a dangerous neighborhood. \\"He said, \`Mom, if I don't go, they don't have nobody,'\\" Gladys Zimmerman said. Prosecutor Bernardo de la Rionda asked the family members about two incidents. In 2005, George Zimmerman had to take anger management courses after an undercover law enforcement officer accused him of attacking him as he tried to arrest Zimmerman's friend. In another incident, a girlfriend accused Zimmerman of attacking her. No charges were filed. Zimmerman asked to meet with Trayvon Martin's parents before the hearing, but the family's lawyers said this was not the time. \\"We believe (the) Zimmerman request is very self-serving, considering the timing of it 50 days later, right before his bond hearing,\\" said Justin R. Campbell _ an assistant to attorney Benjamin Crump _ in an email Thursday. Legal experts had earlier predicted Zimmerman would likely be granted bail. Key factors include his ties to the local community and that he doesn't appear to be a flight risk since he turned himself in voluntarily after he was charged last week. He also has never been convicted of a serious crime, which would indicate he doesn't pose a threat to society. \\"Although it's not routine for people charged with murder to get bond, they do get bond, and I think there is an excellent argument to be made in his specific case for him to be released on bond,\\" said defense attorney Randy McClean, who practices in Seminole County, about 15 miles northeast of Orlando. Kim Cannaday, a spokeswoman for the Seminole County Sheriff's Office, said she couldn't comment on what security procedures would be in place for Zimmerman if he is released. The sheriff's office does have the ability to monitor defendants outside the county if a judge requests a GPS monitor be used as a condition of release. ___ Anderson reported from Miami. ||||| George Zimmerman stunned a Florida court today by taking the stand and apologizing to the parents of Trayvon Martin, who were sitting in the courtroom during Zimmerman's bond hearing. \\"I am sorry for the loss of your son. I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit younger than I am. I did not know if he was armed or not,\\" Zimmerman said addressing Martin's family directly. Martin's father, Tracy Martin, cried tears of anger after the apology, his attorney Ben Crump told reporters after the hearing. Zimmerman took the stand wearing a dark suit with his hands shackled to a belt around his waist. He appeared to be wearing a bullet-proof vest beneath his loose-fitting suit. His surprising testimony came the same day that ABC News exclusively obtained a photograph showing the bloodied back of Zimmerman's head, which was apparently taken three minutes after he shot and killed Martin. The photo could give credence to Zimmerman's claim that Martin had bashed his head against the concrete as Zimmerman fought for his life. Click here to view the image. Warning: graphic content. The bond hearing concluded this morning with Judge Kenneth Lester agreeing to allow Zimmerman, who is charged with second degree murder, to post a 150,000 bond to get out of jail. The prosecution had argued that Zimmerman should be denied bail or that it should be set at 1 million. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, told reporters after the hearing that he does not expect Zimmerman to be out of jail for a couple of days because it will take some time to come up with the money for bail. After the court hearing, O'Mara rejected the suggestion that they were \\"pandering\\" to the parents, and said Zimmerman wanted to apologize after hearing the parents on TV said that he had never done so. \\"He wanted to respond. I took it that the family wanted to hear from him and he wanted to say it… It should have been done in a private setting but that wasn't afforded him,\\" O'Mara said. Ben Crump, a lawyer for Martin's parents, said the family was furious that Zimmerman could \\"give this self serving apology so he could get a bond.\\" One of the lawyers for the family called the apology \\"disingenuous and insincere.\\" Zimmerman, 28, is being held on charges of second-degree murder for the Feb. 26 shooting of Martin, 17, which could carry a life sentence if he is convicted. The exclusive photo obtained by ABC News shows blood trickling down the back of Zimmerman's head from two cuts. It also shows a possible contusion forming on the crown of his head. The original police report that night notes that the back of Zimmerman's head was wet, and that he was bleeding from the nose and head. Zimmerman told police that night that he shot and killed the teenager in self-defense after Martin punched him and pounced on him. Zimmerman told police that Martin then bashed his head into the concrete sidewalk during the altercation that took place in the tidy middle-class development of the Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman was treated at the scene by paramedics, then cuffed and driven in a police cruiser to the Sanford police station. He was questioned for hours and later released. In police surveillance video obtained last month by ABC News, Zimmerman's wounds are not apparent, and there were no bandages on his head. Zimmerman was not admitted to a hospital or given stitches the night of the incident. The person who took the photograph of a bloodied Zimmerman, asking not to be identified, told ABC News exclusively that they did not see the scuffle that night, but did hear it. The person recalled seeing Martin's prostrate body on the wet grass and said the gunpowder burns on Martin's gray hoodie were clearly visible. The photographer said that after the shooting, Zimmerman asked the photographer to call his wife. When the photographer asked him what to say, Zimmerman blurted out, \\"Man, just tell her I shot someone.\\" Investigators have seen the photo. Crump, the Martin family attorney, is skeptical. \\"How bad could it have been if they didn't take him to the hospital [and] didn't stitch him up,\\" he said in a statement to ABC News in response to the image. \\"The special prosecutor has seen all the evidence and still believes George Zimmerman murdered Trayvon Martin.\\" Testifying today, Zimmerman's father, Robert, a former magistrate, told the court that the day after Martin was killed he saw injuries his son suffered. \\"His face was swollen quite a bit,\\" Robert Zimmerman said. \\"There was a protective cover over his nose, his lip was cut and there were two vertical gashes on the back of his head.\\" Zimmerman's parents and wife Shellie testified at the hearing by phone because they did not want to make a public appearance out of fear for their safety. In a dramatic moment during the hearing, a detective, under questioning from O'Mara, admitted that it has no clear evidence that Zimmerman attacked Trayvon Martin first. Zimmerman's family testified that he should be granted bail because, they said, he is not a violent person. \\"He's absolutely not a violent person or a threat to the community,\\" said Shellie Zimmerman, who is a nursing student. In 2005, Zimmerman was arrested in Orange County, Fla., and accused of battering a police officer and obstructing justice. He pleaded to a lower charge and was ordered to attend an anger management program. Both his wife and father testified that Zimmerman had seen two men in civilian clothes shoving his friend against a wall and that the officers never identified themselves as police. However, a police affidavit claimed that when the officers showed their badges Zimmerman said, \\"I don't care who you are.\\" In a second incident, prosecutor Bernie de la rionda said that a woman got an injunction against Zimmerman after he pushed her and slapped her mouth. Shellie Zimmerman testified that her husband was defending himself after the woman attacked him and drew blood. She said that Zimmerman got an injunction against the woman. ||||| After George Zimmerman took the stand during his bond hearing and told Trayvon Martin's parents that he was sorry for the loss of their son, a Florida judge Friday set Zimmerman's bond at 150,000. The judge set a number of conditions, including GPS monitoring. The judge said Zimmerman wouldn't have the opportunity to be released Friday, because his attorney and state authorities needed to hammer out the monitoring and other logistics. Friday's bond hearing also included testimony from one of the state's main investigators in the case, with Zimmerman attorney Mark O'Mara challenging the state's assertions. Under questioning, the investigator said the state didn't have evidence to contradict Zimmerman's account that Martin started the fight that led to the shooting, but he did say evidence did call into question other parts of Zimmerman's account. Zimmerman, 28, was charged on April 11 with second-degree murder in the February death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, after the case sparked a heated, national debate over racial profiling and saw thousands of protesters demand Zimmerman's arrest. Martin's family contends Zimmerman racially profiled their son, who was black, and was walking back from a convenience store in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who is Hispanic, maintains he acted in self-defense. His family says he did not profile Martin. (Timeline of case) The following is a running account of the bond hearing: [Updated at 12:14 p.m. ET] The state's attorney in today's bond hearing, reacting to reporters' questions about O'Mara's assault on the prosecution's case, said that not all evidence has been publicly revealed. \\"We did not put our entire case on today. Let's leave it at that,\\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. [Updated at 11:55 a.m. ET] Mark NeJame, an Orlando lawyer and CNN legal analyst, said O'Mara's move to put Zimmerman on the stand during the bond hearing \\"was a calculated risk to humanize George Zimmerman.\\" \\"We've heard a lot of negative things for weeks now, and we've now heard a living breathing person\\" make an apology, NeJame said. [Updated at 11:15 a.m. ET] The hearing is over. Zimmerman stood up and shook hands with his attorney, Mark O'Mara, before sitting down again to wait to be taken from the courtroom. [Updated at 11:10 a.m. ET] The judge has set a bond of 150,000, with conditions. The conditions include: - GPS monitoring - Zimmerman would have to contact authorities every three days - No contact with the victim's family - No possession of firearms - No use of controlled substances, other than those prescribed by a physician. As for O'Mara's request that Zimmerman be allowed to reside away from Florida, the judge said O'Mara and the state should get together and determine whether that can be accomplished. Because O'Mara and the state need to meet about the arrangements for monitoring, Zimmerman will not have an opportunity to be freed today. the judge said. [Updated at 11:07 a.m. ET] The state's attorney is now making a case against leniency when it comes to the bond decision, and has asked for no bond, or a bond of 1 million. The state's attorney argued that Zimmerman is a danger to the public, citing not only the second-degree murder charge, but a previous charge of battery against a law enforcement officer, which was discussed at length earlier in the hearing. [Updated at 11:02 a.m. ET] The hearing is now turning back to the issue of bond. O'Mara is asking the judge for: - 15,000 bond. - The ability of Zimmerman to leave the state - Secrecy over Zimmerman's whereabouts O'Mara, speaking to Zimmerman's ability to pay bond, noted that Zimmerman cannot work in public because of the case's publicity, and that his wife is not working because she is in school. [Updated at 10:58 a.m. ET] The prosecuting attorney is now questioning Zimmerman. He asked whether Zimmerman had ever said he was sorry when he spoke to police. Zimmerman responded that he had told one of the investigators that \\"I felt sorry for the family.\\" The prosecutor told Zimmerman that if that's true, it must have been recorded. He asked Zimmerman if he was sure, and Zimmerman said he was \\"fairly certain.\\" [Updated at 10:55 a.m. ET] \\"I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son,\\" Zimmerman said on the stand, apparently addressing Martin's parents, who are in the room. (Watch video of apology) Zimmerman also said he thought Martin was older, and that he \\"didn't know if (Martin) was armed or not.\\" [Updated at 10:54 a.m. ET] Zimmerman is about the address the court. His attorney has called him to the stand. [Updated at 10:53 a.m. ET] The prosecuting attorney, after saying \\"I didn't know we were going to be trying the case today,\\" is back to ask questions of state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, after O'Mara asked questions challenging the state's assertions. The prosecutor asked Gilbreath whether there was any evidence indicating that Zimmerman's account that Martin bashed his head against a sidewalk wasn't true. Gilbreath said yes. [Updated at 10:47 a.m. ET] O'Mara is back to questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, one of the investigators in the case. O'Mara asked whether Gilbreath knows who started the fight between Zimmerman and Martin, or had any evidence as to who started the fight. Gilbreath said no. O'Mara asked whether Gilbreath had any evidence contradicting Zimmerman's statement to Sanford police on the night of the incident that Zimmerman: 1) turned toward his car after losing sight of Martin; and 2) that Martin started the fight that led to the shooting. Gilbreath said no. [Updated at 10:36 a.m. ET] A prosecuting attorney is now questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, after Zimmerman's attorney took issue with wording in a probable cause affidavit that Gilbreath had signed. Gilbreath is one of the investigators in the Martin shooting case. Like O'Mara, the prosecuting attorney is asking Gilbreath about the affidavit, and about evidence that Gilbreath collected. The general thrust of the questioning is designed to bolster the affidavit's credibility, after O'Mara questioned word choices in the affidavit. Gilbreath testified he has reviewed other evidence documents other than what has been discussed in the hearing. The prosecutor asked Gilbreath whether Martin had a right to be in the neighborhood - Gilbreath said yes. Gilbreath also was asked if there was no evidence that Martin was committing any crime, and again Gilbreath said yes. [Updated at 10:28 a.m. ET] O'Mara still is questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath about the way that the probable cause affidavit - which supported the second-degree murder charge - was written. O'Mara is now taking issue with a line that says Zimmerman \\"disregarded\\" a police dispatcher. On the tape that has been released to the public, Zimmerman indicated that he was following Martin, and the dispatcher said that authorities didn't need Zimmerman to do that. O'Mara, through his questioning of Gilbreath, is basically suggesting that \\"disregarded\\" was the wrong word, because Zimmerman did not hang up with the dispatcher, and therefore did not disregard him. O'Mara also is taking issue with the affidavit saying that Zimmerman \\"confronted\\" Martin. O'Mara is contending that Gilbreath has offered no evidence that Zimmerman confronted Martin, and that other, less antagonistic words, should have been used since Gilbreath had no evidence that Zimmerman confronted him. Such words, O'Mara said, would be \\"came up to,\\" or \\"spoke with.\\" [Updated at 10:19 a.m. ET] O'Mara, while questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, is now taking issue with other language choices in the probable cause affidavit. O'Mara has noted that the only two quotes in the affidavit from Zimmerman - taken from a police call that Zimmerman made to notify police that he had seen a suspicious person - are of Zimmerman using expletives. O'Mara asked why - out of everything Zimmerman said - only those two quotes were included in the affidavit. Gilbreath responded that he didn't type the affidavit. O'Mara pointed out that Gilbreath swore to it, and Gilbreath agreed that he had. [Updated at 10:14 a.m. ET] O'Mara, while questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, has taken issue with the word \\"profiled\\" in the probable cause affidavit supporting the second-degree murder charge. The affidavit, which Gilbreath had signed, says that Zimmerman profiled Martin. O'Mara asked why the affidavit says profiled, rather than \\"noticed\\" or \\"saw.\\" Gilbreath said he couldn't remember who wrote the word, saying it was a collaborative document. [Updated at 10:09 a.m. ET] O'Mara has called Dale Gilbreath, an investigator with the state attorney's office, to the stand. Gilbreath is one of the investigators in the Martin shooting case. Gilbreath has indicated that he didn't expect to testify today. [Updated at 10:05 a.m. ET] O'Mara asked Zimmerman's mother whether she has come to know her son as someone who comes to the defense of people. She said yes. She said he has stood up for children and homeless people in and around his community. She also testified that he had been a mentor for two African American children. [Updated at 10:04 a.m. ET] O'Mara asked Zimmerman's mother about Zimmerman's previous charge of battery against a law enforcement officer. She said that Zimmerman was involved in an altercation with a plainclothes ATF agent because he was coming to the defense of a friend, who was being roughed up. The officer didn't identify himself as a law enforcement officer, she said. [Updated at 10:02 a.m. ET] Zimmerman's mother, like his father and wife earlier this morning, said that if Zimmerman is released on bond, his location and the places where he would be allowed to go should be kept secret, because he and the family have received threats. [Updated at 9:53 a.m. ET] O'Mara has now called Zimmerman's mother to the phone. [Updated at 9:51 a.m. ET] Now being questioned by O'Mara, Zimmerman's father testified about Zimmerman's appearance after the February 26 shooting. The father said Zimmerman's face was swollen \\"quite a bit,\\" had a protective cover over his nose, and had two vertical gashes on the back of his head. According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman told authorities that after he called 911 about a suspicious person (later identified as Martin), and after he briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk. [Updated at 9:47 a.m. ET] The prosecution is asking Zimmerman's father about Zimmerman's previous charge of battery against a law enforcement officer, basically having the father acknowledge that he knows Zimmerman faced that charge. Like the exchange that the prosecution had with Zimmerman's wife a few minutes ago, they went over the fact that Zimmerman took anger management classes as a result of that charge, which was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor. [Updated at 9:41 a.m. ET] O'Mara is asking Zimmerman's father about his financial ability to help post bond. The father, who said he was retired, said he and his wife have some savings, but very little. He said he had a mortgaged home, and that he was willing to secure the home as part of a bond arrangement. [Updated at 9:39 a.m. ET] O'Mara is now questioning Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman Sr., who, like Zimmerman's wife, is testifying by phone. A notary public has sworn Robert Zimmerman in. [Updated at 9:36 a.m. ET] O'Mara questioned Zimmerman's wife about the previous allegations against Zimmerman - including a charge of battery on a law enforcement officer and an altercation with a woman - that the prosecuting attorney brought up. Through questioning, Zimmerman's wife testified that the battery charge was reduced to a misdemeanor through a pretrial diversion program in which he took anger management classes, and that she believes he completed those classes. She also testified that in the altercation with the woman, Zimmerman was not arrested, and that the woman attacked Zimmerman and drew blood, and that as a result, Zimmerman got an injunction against that woman. [Updated at 9:30 a.m. ET] The prosecuting attorney summed up the previous allegations - including the charge of battery on a law enforcement officer - and then asked Zimmerman's wife whether she still believes Zimmerman isn't a danger to the community. \\"Absolutely he is not a violent person,” nor is he a threat to the community, she responded. [Updated at 9:24 a.m. ET] The prosecution is now questioning Zimmerman's wife about her assertion that Zimmerman poses no danger to the community. The prosecuting attorney is pointing out that Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder, and that Zimmerman is accused of a violent act. The prosecuting attorney also is asking Zimmerman's wife about his previous brushes with the law, including a charge of battery of a law enforcement officer. He also brought up a woman's previous allegations that the woman and Zimmerman were in an altercation - Zimmerman's wife answered that she is aware that Zimmerman needed to defend himself from an attack by the woman, that the woman drew blood, and that Zimmerman filed for a protective order because of the incident. The prosecutor is asking her whether she is aware of those charges and allegations in the past, and she said she is. [Updated at 9:20 a.m. ET] Zimmerman's wife said she fears for Zimmeran's safety and the safety of their family, and that is part of the reason why she is testifying by phone. Asked if she believes Zimmerman is a danger to society, she said no. She said she has \\"no concerns whatsoever\\" about him. [Updated at 9:18 a.m. ET] O'Mara is asking Zimmerman's wife about the family's financial ability to post bond. O'Mara is saying that Zimmerman is indigent; Zimmerman's wife said that she has talked to other family members about scraping up everything they could in anticipation of posting bond. [Updated at 9:15 a.m. ET] With Zimmerman's wife on speakerphone, O'Mara has begun asking her questions. Asked if she would do everything in her power to ensure that Zimmerman - should he be granted bail - return to court when he is required to do so, she said yes. And she said she would contact the court if she lost contact with him. [Updated at 9:11 a.m. ET] The court has called Zimmerman's wife on the phone. A notary public is with Mrs. Zimmerman and is swearing her in. [Updated at 9:08 a.m. ET] Lester has begun the proceeding. After the attorneys identified themselves to the judge, O'Mara kicked off the bond request and told the judge that witnesses are available by phone. The court is calling those witnesses now. As we noted earlier, Zimmerman's family has offered to give testimony by phone. [Updated at 9:04 a.m. ET] Zimmerman, wearing a dark gray suit, white shirt and light gray tie, has entered the courtroom and has seated himself next to O'Mara. [Updated at 9:00 a.m. ET] Martin's parents are, indeed, in the courtroom, and they've taken their seats. O'Mara, Zimmerman's attorney, also is standing the courtroom, waiting for the proceeding to begin. [Updated at 8:59 a.m. ET] Check out this piece on why evidence in the case may come up in the bond hearing. The prosecutor, Corey, has the burden of showing why bond should not be set or that it should be high. The burden is referred to as \\"proof of guilt is evident or presumption of guilt is great.\\" Corey would have to convince Lester that a jury would convict Zimmerman. [Updated at 8:55 a.m. ET] The bond hearing is expected to begin in minutes. Martin's parents are expected to be at the hearing, and this would be the first time that they and Zimmerman are in the same room, CNN's Martin Savidge tells us from the site. O'Mara filed a motion that asks the court to allow Zimmerman's family members to provide testimony at the bond hearing by telephone. The state attorney's office did not object. |||||","completion":"George Zimmerman, the man accused of the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, has been granted the possibility of release on a 150,000 bail by the judge. Zimmerman apologized to Martin's parents for the teenager's death during the court hearing. The judge set several release conditions for Zimmerman, including that he cannot have any firearms, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs, and must observe a curfew between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, requested that his client be allowed to live in another state due to threats made against him and wear a GPS monitor to track his whereabouts. Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, but claims self-defense and that Martin was the aggressor in their confrontation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - In logic, a logical connective (also called a logical operator) is a symbol or word used to connect two or more sentences (of either a formal or a natural language) in a grammatically valid way, such that the sense of the compound sentence produced depends only on the original sentences. - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\". - In logic, a substructural logic is a logic lacking one of the usual structural rules (e.g. of classical and intuitionistic logic), such as weakening, contraction, exchange or associativity. Two of the more significant substructural logics are relevant logic and linear logic. - In mathematical logic, a sequent is a very general kind of conditional assertion. - In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proved on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theoremsand generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally \\"deductive\\", in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is \\"experimental\\". - In logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called \\"modus ponens\\" takes two premises, one in the form \\"If p then q\\" and another in the form \\"p\\", and returns the conclusion \\"q\\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion. - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature. - In proof theory, a structural rule is an inference rule that does not refer to any logical connective, but instead operates on the judgment or sequents directly. Structural rules often mimic intended meta-theoretic properties of the logic. Logics that deny one or more of the structural rules are classified as substructural logics. - Idempotency of entailment is a property of logical systems that states that one may derive the same consequences from many instances of a hypothesis as from just one . This property can be captured by a structural rule called contraction , and in such systems one may say that entailment is idempotent if and only if contraction is an admissible rule . Rule of Contraction : from A , C , C B is derived A , C B. Or in sequent calculus notation , frac ( Gamma , C , C vdash B ) ( Gamma , C vdash B ) - In logic, a rule of inference is admissible in a formal system if the set of theorems of the system does not change when that rule is added to the existing rules of the system. In other words, every formula that can be derived using that rule is already derivable without that rule, so, in a sense, it is redundant. The concept of an admissible rule was introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1955). - Paul Lorenzen (March 24, 1915 October 1, 1994) was a German philosopher and mathematician, founder of the Erlangen School (with Wilhelm Kamlah) and inventor of game semantics (with Kuno Lorenz).

This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.Several years would pass before Simon & Garfunkel worked together again.

Washington (CNN) -- Troubling questions over Georgia's controversial death penalty system will remain unresolved for now, after the Supreme Court declined Monday to review an appeal from a death-row inmate who received unwanted help from state prosecutors on his legal representation. The justices without comment rejected Jamie Ryan Weis' request for relief. He says he sat in jail for years after the state ran out of money to pay for his lawyers. Weis said prosecutors then suggested that a judge appoint two public defenders, even offering the names of two overworked and inexperienced attorneys who did not want the job. Weis' current legal team calls that a blatant conflict of interest.

The situation raises concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of Georgia's death penalty system, specifically in relation to the provision of adequate legal representation for defendants. The fact that the Supreme Court has declined to review Weis' appeal means that these complex issues will remain unresolved for the time being, leaving other death-row inmates in the state potentially vulnerable to similar challenges in securing their legal rights. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy trial and effective counsel for defendants in criminal cases. In Weis' case, his initial legal representation was withdrawn due to the state's budgetary issues, leaving him without counsel for an extended period. When state prosecutors then recommended two public defenders who were both overworked and inexperienced, it further complicated matters, as their reluctance to take on the case could have jeopardized Weis' chances of receiving a fair trial and proper legal defense. The fact that the Supreme Court chose not to review this appeal highlights the difficulty in addressing systemic flaws within the death penalty framework. States may face funding shortages and other logistical issues that can inadvertently impact a defendant's right to a fair trial. Additionally, issues of conflict of interest, as demonstrated in Weis' case, can further undermine public trust in the system's ability to ensure justice is served. In order to prevent similar issues from arising in the future, potential solutions could involve increased oversight and regulation of the legal representation process for death penalty cases. This may require additional funding and resources to be allocated to public defender offices, along with the implementation of more stringent guidelines and requirements for the attorneys appointed to these roles. By improving the quality and availability of legal representation in capital cases, states can minimize the risk of unconstitutional practices and help guarantee that defendants' rights are fully protected throughout the legal process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plates on the Earth's crust move slowly past each other. 2. As the plates move, they exert a great force. 3. When the force is large enough, the crust breaks. 4. The stress is released as energy. 5. The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves. 6. We feel the earthquake. Given information: - Night will fall, and wind will not pass as much as it usually does. Question: - How will this perturbation affect the second effect mentioned (the force exerted by plates)? Now, let's analyze the information given and how it affects the process outlined above. The perturbation described concerns the decrease in wind during nighttime. Wind is primarily a result of atmospheric pressure differences caused by uneven heating of the Earth's surface. It doesn't have a direct effect on the movement of tectonic plates or the force they exert, as tectonic plate movement is primarily driven by processes in the Earth's mantle, such as convection currents, mantle plumes, and forces related to the Earth's rotation. Since the wind decrease in the scenario provided doesn't directly impact the forces driving tectonic plates, we can conclude that the perturbation has no effect on the second effect mentioned (the force exerted by the plates)."},{"prompt":"Question: what are corporation balance I found the following answer on Google: Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections \\"balancing.\\" Is that a correct answer?

This nature-inspired decor piece is perfect for adding a touch of coastal charm to any space, and it's a great way to display your collection of seashells gathered from your beach adventures. In this article, we'll guide you through the steps to create your very own driftwood and seashell wall hanging that will impress your guests and add a calming ocean vibe to your living space. Step 1: Collect your materials To begin your project, you'll need to gather a few essential materials. These include: - A selection of seashells in different shapes and sizes - A piece of driftwood, approximately 12-18 inches long - A drill and small drill bit - A pair of scissors - A roll of sturdy string, such as twine or hemp cord - Optional: beads or additional decorative elements Step 2: Wash your seashells Before starting the assembly, it's important to give your seashells a thorough cleaning. This will remove any dirt, sand or debris that might still be clinging to them. Simply soak the shells in a bucket of warm water mixed with a mild detergent for about 15 minutes. After soaking, gently scrub each shell with a soft brush, then rinse with clean water and let them dry completely. Step 3: Drill holes in the shells Next, you'll need to create small holes in each of your seashells to enable them to be strung onto the string. Using a small drill bit, carefully drill a hole near the top of each shell. To prevent cracking, start with a small pilot hole and gradually increase the size until you have the desired hole size for your string to pass through. Step 4: Cut your string Cut multiple pieces of string to the desired length for your wall hanging. The length may vary depending on how many shells you have and your preferred style – some may want longer strands with multiple shells, while others may opt for shorter strands with just one or two shells. Remember to leave extra length for tying knots and attaching to the driftwood. Step 5: Tie the string to the driftwood Lay your driftwood piece on a flat surface, and arrange the cut strings along the length of the driftwood, spacing them evenly apart. One by one, secure each string in place by tying a secure knot around the driftwood. Ensure that the knots are tight and will hold the weight of the shells. Step 6: Add shells to the string Thread the seashells onto each piece of string by passing the string through the drilled holes. You can create a variety of patterns by mixing and matching different shell types and sizes. If desired, you could also add beads or other decorative elements to further personalize your wall hanging. Step 7: Hang your driftwood Finally, it's time to display your DIY driftwood and seashell wall hanging. Choose a spot on your wall where you'd like to hang the piece, ensuring that it can support the weight of the assembled wall hanging. You can either attach a hanging hook directly to the wall or use a piece of string to create a small loop at the top of the driftwood for easy hanging. Conclusion: A driftwood and seashell wall hanging is a creative and unique way to bring a touch of beach-inspired decor to your home. By following these simple steps, you can create a stunning art piece using natural materials that hold special memories from your seaside adventures. So, get crafting and give your home a lovely, coastal makeover with your very own DIY driftwood and seashell wall hanging."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) suffered its first trial loss in a lawsuit claiming its talc-based products including Johnson’s Baby Powder contain cancer-causing asbestos, with a New Jersey jury on Thursday ordering J&J; and another company to pay 37 million in damages. FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo The verdict of liability in Middlesex County Superior Court in New Brunswick came as J&J; fights thousands of cases claiming its talc products can also cause ovarian cancer. The jury found J&J; and another company liable after more than two months of trial. The lawsuit was brought by New Jersey resident Stephen Lanzo, who said he developed mesothelioma after inhaling dust that was generated through his regular use of J&J; talc powder products since his birth in 1972. Mesothelioma is a deadly form of cancer closely associated with exposure to asbestos. It affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities, most often around the lungs, but also in the abdomen and elsewhere. The jury awarded Lanzo 30 million and his wife 7 million in compensatory damages. It found J&J; was responsible for 70 percent of the damages and said a unit of France-based Imerys SA (IMTP.PA), its talc supplier, was responsible for 30 percent. The jury will return on Tuesday for further proceedings to determine whether to award punitive damages, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network. J&J; denied the allegations and says Johnson’s Baby Powder does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. J&J; in a statement said it was disappointed but would withhold further comment until the trial’s completion. Gwen Myers, an Imerys spokeswoman, said Imerys plans to appeal and is confident talc did not cause Lanzo’s cancer. The Lanzos did not respond to requests for comment. J&J;, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, faces talc-related lawsuits by 6,610 plaintiffs nationally, largely based on claims it failed to warn women about the risk of developing ovarian cancer by using its products for feminine hygiene. In five trials in Missouri involving ovarian cancer lawsuits, juries found J&J; liable four times and awarded the plaintiffs a total of 307 million. In California, a jury awarded a now-deceased woman 417 million. But in October, a Missouri appellate court threw out the first verdict there for 72 million and a California judge tossed the 417 million verdict. J&J; is seeking to reverse the other verdicts. Asbestos claims are a more recent challenge for J&J.; It won the only other asbestos-related trial in November when a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ruled in its favor. (This story corrects headline to show case was J&J;’s first trial loss in an asbestos-related case involving talc, not first loss in talc cancer lawsuit. Corrects paragraph 1 to say both J&J; and another company have been ordered to pay 37 mln, not just J&J;) ||||| (CNN) Johnson & Johnson and talc company Imerys SA must pay 117 million in damages to a couple after the husband, a New Jersey banker, got cancer after decades of using talcum powder. The Middlesex County, New Jersey, jury ordered the companies to pay 80 million in punitive damages Wednesday. Last week, it awarded banker Stephen Lanzo 30 million in compensatory damages and his wife 7 million in damages. Lanzo said he used Johnson & Johnson products like Shower to Shower and Baby Powder for more than 30 years, and he claimed that inhaling the powder caused his mesothelioma , an aggressive and deadly cancer that impacts the lining of the lungs. Deposits of talc, one of Earth's softest minerals , are often located near deposits of the minerals that constitute asbestos, and studies have shown the risk of cross-contamination during mining. Johnson & Johnson said its talc products do not contain asbestos, which, it noted, has been a legal requirement since the 1970s. Lanzo's case was the first to go to trial in New Jersey, the home state of Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson and other talcum powder companies face thousands of separate but related cases that draw a connection between genital talc use and ovarian cancer. The Lanzos' lawyers accused the company of holding back information from its customers about the health risks of asbestos in its talc products since the 1960s. Johnson & Johnson argued that it did extensive testing to make sure its products were not contaminated. \\"Johnson's Baby Powder has been used for more than 120 years and it does not contain asbestos or cause mesothelioma,\\" the company said in a statement Wednesday. \\"After suffering multiple losses through court rulings and at trial, plaintiff's attorneys have shifted their strategy and are now alleging that talcum powder is contaminated with asbestos, despite multiple independent, non-litigation-driven scientific evaluations which have found that our baby powder does not contain asbestos. \\"Throughout this trial, we were prevented from presenting evidence we believe would have been important to the jury in their deliberations, which forced us to file multiple mistrial motions. We will continue to defend the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder and immediately begin our appeal, and we believe that once the full evidence is reviewed, this decision will be reversed.\\" Gwen Myers, a spokeswoman for talc supplier Imerys, said in a statement last week, \\"Our hearts go out to those affected by all forms of cancer. We are disappointed by the jury's decision, but we remain confident that talc did not cause Mr. Lanzo's cancer. The evidence was clear that his asbestos exposure came from a different source such as the asbestos found in his childhood home or schools, and the jury's decision is inconsistent with a recently published study of workers who mined and milled talc all day over the course of more than 50 years that did not find a single case of mesothelioma.

We intend to appeal this decision and will continue to stand by the safety of our product.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and its talc supplier Imerys SA have been ordered by a New Jersey jury to pay 80 million in punitive damages and 37 million in compensatory damages. The case was brought by Stephen Lanzo, who claimed that he developed mesothelioma, a cancer linked to asbestos, after using J&J talc powder products since 1972. J&J, which is facing 6,610 talc-related lawsuits in the US, denied its baby powder contains asbestos or causes cancer, and said it plans to appeal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She needed something, something that she could grab onto, and hold, hold until it hurt, hold until blood made racing red lines down her arms, until her hands were raw. She left the room and walked quietly into the now guest room that had been Rob's. Opening the closet, she found the teddy bear that Rob had once confided in and held it in her arms tight as she slumped down on the bed. A quiet sobbing rang through the house accompanied only by the chime of the grandfather clock in the living room every fifteen minutes. As Jan lay on the guest room bed she soon resorted to deep gasps, knowing that meager tears would never be forceful enough to express her worry to those that listened. \\"Just bring him home, bring him home, bring him home,\\" she mumbled over and over, each time changing the tone slightly in a desperate attempt to make her pleading sound more real. She could hear the occasional snore of her husband and she hated him for it. What kind of person could find sleep at a time like this? Why wasn't he awake worrying? Why wasn't he with her?

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Who does King Priam welcome as a guest? Helen A:","completion":"Title: The Curse of the Emerald Tiara Genre: Historical Fiction/Adventure/Drama Plot Summary: In ancient Troy, a mysterious visitor arrives with a gift and a secret that would shape the fate of the city. As King Priam welcomes Helen, a beautiful and enchanting woman, new alliances are formed and a legend is born. The Curse of the Emerald Tiara explores the trials and tribulations faced by the people of Troy, and the consequences brought about by a valuable artifact - the Emerald Tiara. Act 1: The story begins in the thriving city of Troy, where King Priam rules with wisdom and fairness. When Helen arrives from Sparta and is welcomed by Priam as a guest, the people of Troy are stunned by her beauty and grace. Helen's husband, King Menelaus of Sparta, had been distant and unloving, prompting her escape. Secretly, Helen brings with her the prized possession of Sparta, the Emerald Tiara - an enchanted artifact rumored to grant great power to its possessor. As the enchanting Helen captures the heart of Prince Paris, King Priam's son, love quickly blossoms between the two. Act 2: On discovering Helen's presence in Troy along with the stolen Tiara, a furious Menelaus demands her return and wages war against Troy. The Trojan War begins, and the Emerald Tiara takes center stage. As the fighting rages, King Priam becomes concerned about the tiara's influence on their city and the people. A prophecy is revealed that whoever holds the Emerald Tiara will experience great power but also unleash destructive bloodshed upon their kingdom. Cursed by the tiara, tensions rise within the city, with friendships strained and trust tested. King Priam grows increasingly desperate to restore peace while retaining the city's honor, but as his family begins to fragment, that peace seems ever more elusive. Act 3: As the battle escalates, the tiara's dark curse begins to take effect. Helen, who has grown to love the Trojans, chooses to return the Tiara in hopes of undoing its damage before it's too late. Paris, torn between his love for Helen and loyalty to his father, decides to embark on a perilous journey to Sparta to return the enchanted artifact. With the help of several brave warriors, Paris crosses enemy lines and delivers the Emerald Tiara back to Menelaus, allowing the curse to be lifted. However, the consequences of their actions can no longer be reversed. Paris says a heartfelt goodbye to Helen, who has chosen to remain in Sparta and face her responsibilities. Act 4: The Trojan War continues to rage, but the people of Troy have regained the strength of unity and purpose. Together, they face their enemies with courage, motivated by their love for their city and their King. As the war nears its end, King Priam summons Paris, honoring him for his bravery and selflessness, and reinstating him as heir to the throne. Conclusion: Though the Curse of the Emerald Tiara brought destruction and suffering to Troy, it also taught its people invaluable lessons about love, loyalty, and sacrifice. The film ends with a somber yet hopeful tone, as the Trojans rebuild their lives and city, stronger and more united than ever before. Through the legend of Helen, Paris, and the Emerald Tiara, the resilience and spirit of Troy will never be forgotten."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

From the moment we stepped inside, we were transported to a culinary paradise where every dish, every flavor, and every moment exceeded our expectations. The ambiance at Gourmet Haven was inviting and warm, with tastefully curated lighting that perfectly balanced the room's intimate setting. The beautiful decor, featuring a pleasant fusion of modern and vintage accents, instantly conveyed a sense of sophistication without being overly pretentious. As soon as we were seated, our knowledgeable and professional waiter, Tom, greeted us with a genuine smile. Throughout our entire evening, he was attentive and efficient without being intrusive. Tom's familiarity with each dish and his ability to gracefully articulate the menu's offerings made it incredibly easy for us to make our selections. We started our meal with a shared appetizer of truffled mushrooms with goat cheese crostini. The earthy, aromatic flavor of the truffle melded perfectly with the tangy, creamy goat cheese, resulting in a decadent and rich flavor sensation. As for the crostini, they were crisp and expertly prepared, providing just the right textural contrast. For our entrees, my husband opted for the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, while I decided on the grass-fed filet mignon. The sea bass was cooked to perfection - the delicate, flaky texture and buttery flavor was enhanced by a light, citrusy beurre blanc sauce that showcased the fish's freshness. My filet mignon was equally impressive, cooked exactly to the requested medium-rare. It was tender, juicy, and accompanied by a silky red wine reduction that perfectly accentuated the meat's inherent succulence. We also shared a side of garlic mashed potatoes, which were creamy, flavorful, and had just the right amount of garlic infused in them. I also appreciated that the portion size was generous without being overwhelming, allowing us to enjoy every last bite. To conclude our meal, we decided to indulge in the signature dessert - a delectable dark chocolate lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream. The warm, gooey lava cake was an absolutely divine combination of rich, velvety dark chocolate and a gooey center that practically melted in our mouths. The accompanying ice cream was the ideal complement, its creamy, natural vanilla flavor balancing the intensity of the chocolate. And, just when we thought our experience couldn't get any better, the restaurant surprised us with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine as we were celebrating our anniversary, adding an extra touch of thoughtfulness to our memorable evening. In conclusion, our dining experience at Gourmet Haven was an absolute delight from start to finish. The exquisite food, the impeccable service, and the enchanting atmosphere have earned this extraordinary establishment a well-deserved spot on our list of must-return restaurants. If you're seeking a superb dining experience for a special occasion or just an unforgettable meal, I wholeheartedly recommend Gourmet Haven."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, the two sentences can be considered paraphrases of each other, as they both convey the same overall meaning despite some differences in the structure and wording. Both sentences discuss the functioning of provisional councils, where they have started operating or acting as national governments for independent countries. In the first sentence, \\"The provisional councils had already begun to operate more or less as national governments of independent countries,\\" the verb \\"operate\\" is used to describe how these councils have been functioning. The phrase \\"more or less\\" emphasizes that they are not fully functioning as national governments but are close to it. The focus here is on the active process of \\"operating\\" in a way that resembles national governments. In the second sentence, \\"The provisional councils had already begun acting more or less as national governments of independent countries,\\" the verb \\"acting\\" is used instead of \\"operate.\\" This also conveys a sense that the councils are behaving or taking action in a manner that aligns with national governments, but not completely, as they are still only \\"more or less\\" functioning in that capacity. Though the two sentences use slightly different wording, both are expressing the idea that provisional councils have started to function in a manner that closely resembles national governments, even if they may not be fully there yet. Therefore, the differing verb choices do not significantly alter the meaning, and the sentences can be seen as paraphrases of one another."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites.

After she awakens from one, she looks at her dream journal, which includes drawings detailing characters and events from the first film; during this, she recalls a vision that picks up immediately where the first film ended: after the Tall Man's minions attacked Mike through his bedroom mirror, Reggie heard the commotion and ran upstairs to his aid.

Encyclopedia The most suitable option for looking up information about a sloth is an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias are comprehensive reference works that contain extensive and detailed information on a wide range of subjects, including animals like the sloth. They are designed to provide a reliable, authoritative source of knowledge for readers, with entries written by experts in their respective fields who curate and consolidate facts on various topics. An encyclopedia typically presents factual information in an organized, easily accessible manner, enabling readers to quickly find and understand the information they are looking for. In the context of researching a sloth, an encyclopedia would likely provide information on the animal's taxonomy, physiology, habitat, behavior, and ecological role, among other relevant details. Here are brief descriptions of the other options that are less suitable for looking up what a sloth is: A. Wilderness: This term refers to a natural environment that remains largely undisturbed by human intervention. While one might encounter a sloth in the wilderness, this option does not represent a collection of writings that provide information on the sloth. C. Magazine: Magazines are periodicals that typically focus on a specific subject or theme. They contain articles, essays, and illustrations created by various authors and designers. While it's possible that a magazine might feature an article about sloths, the overall scope of a magazine is not likely to be comprehensive or authoritative enough to provide the depth of information required to thoroughly understand what a sloth is. D. Commercial: This term generally refers to a profit-oriented business activity or an advertisement promoting a product or service. A commercial does not represent a collection of writings and is not an appropriate source for looking up information about a sloth. E. Countryside: This term refers to rural or undeveloped areas outside of cities and towns, typically characterized by natural landscapes and agricultural land. While sloths might inhabit some countryside regions, this option does not represent a collection of writings that provide information on the sloth. In conclusion, the best source for researching information about a sloth is an encyclopedia.

The shocking incident took place in her apartment, leaving Sereda with numerous injuries and deep emotional scars. The young model and Ushanov had reportedly been dating for two years when she decided to put an end to their relationship. Assertions suggest that out of blind rage and malice, Ushanov resorted to physical violence, blatantly ignoring his now ex-girlfriend's personal choice and autonomy. Sereda's terrifying ordeal allegedly involved her being constantly beaten for ten grueling minutes. Ushanov reportedly did not hold back in venting out his anger, as he relentlessly kicked and punched his former partner. The model was left with visible bruises, cuts, and marks from the brutal beating that took place in the supposed safety of her own home. In a stroke of courage and determination, Sereda managed to find an opportunity to escape the wrath of her attacker. Despite her injuries and overwhelming fear, the model made a run for safety after finally being able to open the door to her apartment. Swiftly, she fled from the scene and sought immediate help. After the attack, authorities stepped in to address the alarming situation and apprehend Ushanov for his heinous actions. As the story of Sereda's assault unfolds, her strength and determination to come out of the situation alive is garnering praise and admiration. This unfortunate incident sheds light on the pervasive issue of domestic violence affecting countless individuals worldwide. In relationships, any expression of aggression and violence – whether physical, verbal, or emotional – is not only unacceptable but also criminal. Moreover, this attack serves as a reminder that both men and women in our society need to recognize the importance of respecting personal boundaries and decisions, especially when it comes to ending relationships. Nobody should ever have to suffer or endure physical harm for asserting their personal choices or leaving a toxic relationship. As more details come to the fore about Sereda's traumatic experience, it is essential to offer her support and emotional healing as she steadily recovers from the physical and emotional repercussions of the harrowing incident. Furthermore, it is crucial to foster a culture that condemns violence and promotes healthy, consensual relationships to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break down the phrase and analyze its components to better understand this perspective. 1. \\"Better characters\\": This part implies that the characters being referred to are an improvement in comparison to another set or group of characters. The word \\"better\\" suggests a positive change or enhancement in the quality or depth of the characters. In the context of literature, film, or television show, this can be highly appreciated, as people tend to be drawn towards well-developed, complex, and realistic characters. The indication of character improvement is, therefore, a positive element in this phrase. 2. \\"Some genuine quirkiness\\": The word \\"quirkiness\\" refers to peculiar or unconventional traits, adding uniqueness to individuals, situations, or occurrences. In this phrase, the term \\"genuine\\" emphasizes a sense of authenticity, implying that the quirkiness is not forced or artificial. In various forms of art or entertainment, audiences typically appreciate authenticity and originality. When something is described as having \\"some genuine quirkiness,\\" it implies that it possesses a certain level of uniqueness that sets it apart from others and makes it memorable and appealing. This aspect also contributes positively to the overall perception of the phrase. It is essential to note that, like many phrases, the interpretation may change depending on the context in which the phrase is used. However, based on the analysis of the individual components, the phrase \\"better characters, some genuine quirkiness\\" can be seen as primarily positive. It suggests improvement, authenticity, and uniqueness, which are generally considered to be favorable qualities in the world of entertainment and art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thus, this option does not fit the description of Ash based on the given information. Option 3: Feeling smart. - This option implies Ash feels intelligent, possibly because they managed to cast Robin's vote. Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Ash may have been cunning in their actions and feels smart due to their success in influencing the election. Based on my analysis, A: I would describe Ash as feeling smart, as they successfully cast Robin's vote, leading to the desired outcome of the person winning the election for the 5th time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. \\"There's more of a prize for getting it right.\\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Development of the Vertebral Column and Thoracic cage Development of the vertebrae begins with the accumulation of mesenchyme cells from each sclerotome around the notochord. These cells differentiate into a hyaline cartilage model for each vertebra, which then grow and eventually ossify into bone through the process of endochondral ossification. As the developing vertebrae grow, the notochord largely disappears. However, small areas of notochord tissue persist between the adjacent vertebrae and this contributes to the formation of each intervertebral disc. The ribs and sternum also develop from mesenchyme. The ribs initially develop as part of the cartilage model for each vertebra, but in the thorax region, the rib portion separates from the vertebra by the eighth week. The cartilage model of the rib then ossifies, except for the anterior portion, which remains as the costal cartilage. The sternum initially forms as paired hyaline cartilage models on either side of the anterior midline, beginning during the fifth week of development. The cartilage models of the ribs become attached to the lateral sides of the developing sternum. Eventually, the two halves of the cartilaginous sternum fuse together along the midline and then ossify into bone. The manubrium and body of the sternum are converted into bone first, with the xiphoid process remaining as cartilage until late in life. Q: The accumulation of what cells begin the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage? Choices: - semiosis cells - hindbrain cells - False cells - mesenchyme cells A: Answer:","completion":"The accumulation of mesenchyme cells begins the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Prosecutors say he accepted 3.7m reais (1.11m; Â£867,000) in bribes connected to the multi-billion dollar scheme. Lula, 70, had already been charged in August with allegedly obstructing investigations. He denies any wrongdoing and says the accusations are politically motivated. \\"I am sad,\\" Lula said in New York. \\"It is a big farce, a big lie, a big pyrotechnic show. \\"What's happening isn't getting me down, but just motivates me to go out and talk more.\\" Judge Sergio Moro, who is overseeing Operation Car Wash, the investigation into corruption allegations at Petrobras, said there was \\"sufficient evidence of [Lula's] responsibility\\". The money that the ex-president allegedly received was laundered through the purchase and renovation of a beach apartment, prosecutors say. The flat was built by a construction company implicated in the scandal. His wife, Marisa Leticia, and six others have also been indicted. Lula was accused by prosecutors of being the \\"boss\\" of the scheme, estimated to have cost the company more than 2bn (Â£1.5bn). Several politicians and Petrobras executives have been arrested and sentenced as a result of the two-year inquiry. Investigators believe overpriced contracts with Petrobras were given in return for bribes. Some of the illicitly-obtained money was used to finance the electoral campaign of top Brazilian politicians, they allege. Lula, who served as president between 2003 and 2011, was one of Brazil's most popular leaders and is seen as a possible candidate for the 2018 presidential elections. However, the popularity of his Workers' Party plummeted this year and his chosen successor Dilma Rousseff was impeached last month. A criminal conviction would bar him from running in 2018.

In that same interview, Cudi said that while he believes in God, he considers himself spiritual but not religious. In a March 2013 interview, Kid Cudi talked about how his initial sudden and unexpected fame drove him to alcohol and drugs: \\"For me, I just got to this point, and especially up until recently, I gave up liquor, I don't drink anymore, it's been five and a half months I've been sober.

The connection between the vessel and Oliver Hazard Perry lies in the type of frigate it is, which is known as an \\"Oliver Hazard Perry-class\\" frigate – a class of retired guided-missile frigates primarily used by the United States Navy. The ship was not named after Oliver Hazard Perry, so the mention of him not wanting a Medal of Honor is not directly related to the topic of the preceding text.

It can influence our choice of purchase when we go shopping and can also affect the way we look and feel. A person can be naturally attracted to one particular color1 while finding another color1 repulsive. The influence of color1 on human emotions and feelings is very powerful and designers, advertisers, artists and even doctors use _ in their professions for different purposes. Every day, without even thinking about it, we use color1 to communicate our feelings. For example, the color1 we choose to wear is one way of expressing ourselves. It says something about the person, how he or she feels, and how he or she wants others to feel about the wearer. In other words, color1 talks. A person who wants to appear stylish and mature will usually wear dark color1s or black. A person who wishes to appear youngish, pure and innocent dresses in white, like the choice of a bride's wedding gown. Also clothed in white are doctors, dentists, nurses and hospital in-patients as the color1 expresses comfort, cleanliness and professionalism. Brown, blue or grey clothes are the usual color1s worn by office workers so as not to draw unnecessary attention to them. They are, in a way, conveying the message that they want to be noticed for their work, not their appearance. People who wear bright, strong color1s like to be attractive and these color1s are particularly popular with actresses, singers and party goers. In the past, common people were not allowed to wear certain color1s. In Thailand, for example, only kings, queens and members of the royal family could wear purple while in ancient China, yellow was the color1 reserved for the emperor and the empress.

Given the question: The U.S. State Department has asked American embassies and consulates around the world to identify certain groups that should get extra scrutiny when they apply for visas. A series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas. The diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \\"population sets\\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S. Even if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial. It is the first evidence of a plan for the \\"extreme vetting\\" of foreigners entering the United States that President Donald Trump promised during his campaign. The four cables sent between March 10 and March 17 do not define which groups would be considered among the \\"population sets\\" requiring more scrutiny. But in the first glimpse into what \\"extreme vetting\\" may look like under the Trump administration, one of Tillerson's memos would have added to the interview process questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses and travel history going back 15 years, as well as all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years. The questions were withdrawn in a following memo, pending approval of the list by another federal agency. The directives, first reported by Reuters, quickly drew criticism from rights groups and others who've accused Trump of discriminating against Muslims through his now-suspended ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \\"These measures could provide license for discrimination based on national origin and religion,'' human rights group Amnesty International wrote in a letter to Tillerson on Thursday. \\"They...

Formerly a courthouse which served the. nearby market town of Llanrwst, the cottage, known locally as ‘the red. house’, was taken over in the 1930s by two elderly ladies who made money. by inviting locals around for evenings of musical entertainment. It is now owned by the National Trust. and leased by Tim Maddox, a former Londoner who escaped the city a. decade ago to run the tearooms and enjoy a slower pace of life with his. wife and three children. The building sits on the edge of the. Snowdonia national park, alongside an Inigo Jones bridge which straddles. the rushing River Conwy. Mr Maddox, 47, who used to work in publishing,. said: ‘It’s unbelievably picturesque. The trees, the hills and the. mountains are just breathtaking. The drive as you approach is fantastic. 'The view changes every day. The colours, the trees. I have to remind. myself not to take it for granted.’ Autumn brilliance: The Tu Hwnt i'r Bont tearooms is a quaint 15th century cottage on the west bank of the River Conwy, and the historic building is a very popular attraction for tourists at this time of year. It’s hard to imagine that just three. weeks ago many of us were bathing in sunshine and 85F heat - but at. least some areas were still looking beautiful this weekend, ahead of the. start of October. Rain and. gale force winds are set to batter Britain this week as the miserable. autumn shows no signs of improvement, after a month that saw parts of. England experience a 50 per cent rise in rainfall. Flood warnings are. already in place for today and more may follow as rain falls on already. soaking ground. Met Office forecaster Helen Waite said: ‘Northern England had an average of one and half times its monthly rainfall - and temperatures across the country were about half a degree below average.’ However she added that last month’s rainfall across the country was average thanks to the dry and sunny start. Meanwhile, there is more wet weather to come as we enter October tomorrow. Ms Waite said: ‘It’s still quite unsettled and there is a band of rain moving south through the day (Sunday). It’s also very windy, and there are some gales around the coast and the hills. ‘On Monday there will be scattered showers, most persistent in the North-West and perhaps quite heavy at times. It’s still quite blustery and it’s still looking unsettled.’ Leafing summer behind: The first signs of autumn are evident in Pollok Park in Glasgow. Sunshine: A couple make the most of the sunshine along Tynemouth beach, North Tyneside, as the sun rises after a week of bad weather. Life's a beach: A man walks his dog along Tynemouth beach after a week of terrible weather in the north east. It comes after seven kittens, three. cats and four chickens were rescued by the Royal Society for the. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on Friday from a property that was. marooned due to flooding. The. welfare charity’s chief inspector Mark Gent offered to help after. hearing the animals’ owner could not get back to their home near. Stillingfleet, North Yorkshire, because of the high water. Mr. Gent travelled along a badly-flooded stretch of road to the house,. where he safely recovered the animals, which included five two-week old. kittens and two nine-week old kittens. Helping hand: Seven kittens, three cats and four chickens were rescued by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on Friday from a property that was marooned due to flooding. Saved: The welfare charity's chief inspector Mark Gent offered to help after hearing the animals' owner could not get back to their home near Stillingfleet, North Yorkshire, because of the high water. Meanwhile on Tuesday another band of. rain will arrive in the UK, which could cause problems on top of the wet. weather already seen in some parts. There will also be strong winds on. the western coast. More. scattered showers are forecast for Wednesday, but there could be some. sunny spells and it may be a little less windy. Thursday and Friday are. expected to be reasonably pleasant but crisp. ‘Temperatures. are set to be slightly below average during the day with perhaps some. frost at night, which is not unusual for October,’ Ms Waite added. Taken to safety: The RSPCA travelled along a badly-flooded stretch of road to the house, where they safely recovered the animals, which included five two-week old kittens and two nine-week old kittens. Cat eyes: The owner of these animals was much happier after they were rescued in North Yorkshire.

Article: Today, when there are many top graduates looking for top jobs, graduates can differentiate themselves by obtaining a double major or even a double degree. Increasingly, employers are looking for individuals who are not only competent and intelligent, but who have different skill sets and who are knowledgeable in many areas. Part of the appeal to employers is that your extra work demonstrates a willingness to take on difficult tasks. Additionally, if your majors overlap , you are able to show potential employers that you have both _ and depth of knowledge. By studying for a double major, although you will be studying for only one degree, you will be focusing on two related and integrated subjects that complement each other. Classes overlap between the majors, meaning fewer classes are required than with a double degree, so it is easier to finish within four years. In contrast, with the more rigorous double degree, you will be studying for two different degrees in two completely different areas of study. Although pursuing such a course of study allows students to complete two wholly separate degrees in less time than if they were to earn them separately, many strong students still find it incredibly difficult to complete in four or five years. If you are committed to a double major/degree, it is wise to do a little bit of planning. Some students try to find two courses of studies that are related, while others seek to round out their academic studies by choosing two completely unrelated fields. For double majors, common pairings include: (i) economics and a foreign language; (ii) political science or government and journalism; (iii) economics and psychology. For double degrees, common pairings include: (i) engineering and a business program such as finance or accounting; (ii) engineering and economics. Question: Which statement is CORRECT according to the passage? Options: A: Economics is a major while engineering is a degree. B: Every college student should take a double major or degree. C: Earning a double degree is more difficult than obtaining a double major. D: Some students choose two completely unrelated fields to show their ability in academic study.

And the answer is?","completion":"The actress you are referring to is Mackenzie Phillips, who played Julie Horvath on the TV sitcom \\"One Day at a Time.\\" Mackenzie Phillips recently revealed that she had a 10+ year long consensual relationship with her father, John Phillips. Mackenzie Phillips, born November 10, 1959, is the daughter of John Phillips, a musician and member of the 1960s folk-pop band The Mamas & the Papas, and Susan Adams, a former model. Mackenzie started her acting career at a young age, and \\"One Day at a Time\\" brought her considerable fame during the 1970s and 1980s. In her 2009 memoir titled \\"High on Arrival,\\" Mackenzie Phillips courageously shared her difficult personal history, including her struggles with drug addiction and her incestuous relationship with her father. According to Mackenzie, the relationship began when she was 19 years old and continued on and off for over a decade. The relationship was not only consensual but also appears to have been fueled in part by their shared drug addiction. Mackenzie had been in and out of rehab multiple times and was eventually fired from \\"One Day at a Time\\" due to her addiction issues. Mackenzie Phillips' revelations about her relationship with her father stirred up substantial controversy and shock. Several members of her family, including her half-siblings, were divided on the truth of her claims, and her story elicited strong emotions and disbelief from the public. Some people applauded her bravery for coming forward, while others criticized her for airing such private information. Regardless, Mackenzie's story serves as an example of the importance of speaking the truth about taboo subjects, shedding light on the complexity of family relationships, and the particular challenges facing children of celebrities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Due to his erratic driving, Dave determines Elrod is driving his Lamborghini drunk and sets to arrest him. Elrod, objecting to being sent to jail tells Dave of a decayed corpse that he and Kelly had found up in the swamp.When Dave goes to investigate he remembers a murder he had witnessed as a teenager where a chained prisoner was shot in the swamp and disappeared into the bog. The discovery opens a string of events that ties to several murders in that area that had occurred recently mostly to young runaways and prostitutes. The clues seem to point to a former friend of Dave's, Julius \\"Baby Feet\\" Balboni (John Goodman) whose ties with the mafia had caused the two to drift apart and become strained enemies. Julius denies knowing the prostitute whose murder is being investigated. However his story does not corroborate, leading Dave to suspect more to the story.Meanwhile, the discovery of a second body prompts the FBI to become involved in the case, and Dave is partnered with an agent called Rosie Gomez (Justina Machado) whose insight into the case gains Dave's respect and the pair team up to solve the case.

By Meghan Keneally President Obama has paid tribute to President Kennedy at the Medal of Freedom ceremony today as he presented awards to former President Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, country singer Loretta Lynn and newspaper editor Ben Bradlee. In his opening remarks, Obama highlighted the slain President’s sister-in-law Ethel Kennedy, calling her ‘one of my favorite people’ in a room full of dignitaries. He went on to also give President Kennedy’s grandson Jack a shout out by praising his basketball skills. Aside from the fact that the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy’s assassination comes this Friday, the Democrat was mentioned because he was the one to establish the Medal of Freedom initiative which is the highest civilian honor in the country. A tell-all book about the 2012 election revealed that Obama reportedly told aides that he could only take OPTIONS: - Ben Bradlee ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Bill Clinton ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Chelsea ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Democrat ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Ethel Kennedy ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Hillary ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Huma Abedin ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Jack ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Kennedy ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Loretta Lynn ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Medal of Freedom ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Medal of Freedom award ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Meghan Keneally ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Obama ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Oprah Winfrey ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Richard Lugar ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - White House ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program.","completion":"Bill Clinton ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. This ending highlights the relationship between Obama and Clinton that was portrayed in the tell-all book about the 2012 election. Despite their political alliance and common party affiliation, the two leaders occasionally had their differences, which is not uncommon in the world of politics. The sentence illustrates that Obama reportedly found it challenging to be in the company of Clinton for extended periods, and by publicly criticizing Obama's handling of the national health insurance program rollout, Clinton appeared to reciprocate the sentiment. Such disagreements between prominent political figures demonstrate that, although they may belong to the same party and share common goals, their opinions and approaches can differ significantly. The discussion of these disagreements in a tell-all book serves to shed light on the behind-the-scenes relationships and tensions within the world of politics, and offer a more complete understanding of the decision-making process. As shown in this case, the relationship between Obama and Clinton was not without its challenges, but they still managed to work together on various issues in order to advance their shared political goals. In conclusion, the sentence demonstrates the complex relationships and occasional disagreements that can exist between political leaders, even within the same party. The public discourse and reported difficulties between Obama and Clinton, as well as Clinton's criticism of the national health insurance program rollout, show that their working relationship encompassed both cooperation and conflict. These nuances are essential for understanding the dynamics within the political sphere and gaining a deeper insight into the motivations and approaches of influential figures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is one of four sons of Anna Pearl (nee Hite), a maid, and William Henry Cosby Sr., who served as a mess steward in the U.S. Navy. During much of Cosby's early childhood, his father was away from home in Navy service and especially during WWII. As a student, he described himself as a class clown. Context: Cosby left Temple to pursue a career in comedy. He lined up standup jobs at clubs in Philadelphia and then in New York City, where he appeared at The Gaslight Cafe beginning in 1961. He booked dates in cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. In the summer of 1963, he received national exposure on NBC's The Tonight Show. This led to a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, who, in 1964, released his debut LP Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right!, the first of a series of comedy albums. His album To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With was number 1 on Spin Magazines list of \\"The 40 Greatest Comedy Albums of All Time\\", calling it \\"stand-up comedy's masterpiece\\". While many comics of the time were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore material that was controversial and sometimes risque, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby's stories. As Cosby's success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, \\"A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it too.' Okay. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? So I figure this way I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy.\\" In 1983, he released the concert film Bill Cosby: Himself; it is widely regarded as \\"the greatest comedy concert film ever\\". Younger, well-established comics like Jerry Seinfeld have credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of the genre of standup comedy, as well as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television. Seinfeld said of Cosby: \\"He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story. He created that.

News article: What Does the Nobel Peace Prize Mean for Obama? Deputy assistant to President George W. Bush and deputy press secretary from September 2006 to January 2009 Well, those Norwegians were up to their tricks again this morning. Just when you forgot that they were up there, what with autumnal darkness descending on the northern region, they send up a flair to announce their presence by awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to a U.S. president who, while espousing \\"hope\\" for peace, has demonstrated little in the acquiring of \\"actual\\" peace. As if to inconveniently punctuate the silliness, NASA today bombed the moon. In the president's defense, he's had precious little time for actual achievement, being barely nine months into his term. But never mind that. The Nobel committee was fairly explicit that Obama's hope of achieving peace was all that was required, presumably making countless Miss Universe contestants equally eligible. Oh, they mentioned plans for nuclear weapons reductions as well, but of course the smart people would have quickly noted that President George W. Bush reduced stockpiles by nearly 4000 weapons from 6000, making new reductions of a few hundred relatively inconsequential. No, as with all things Obama, it's far better to bet on a hopeful vision than to wait around for what are inevitably becoming disappointing results. Here's the irony: in the Nobel committee's over-reach, rather than honor the U.S. president, they've instead awarded an albatross around his neck and opened him up to mockery. As an American, I'm happy for the president's recognition, but my hope is that over time his record shows him to be deserving -- not for his hopeful quest, but for actual achievement. Democratic member of Congress from Maryland When the Nobel committee announced President Obama as the Peace Prize recipient, thus began the sarcasm, second-guessing and chatter. Some opined that selecting President Obama is either a repudiation of our former president or premature for this one. Perhaps it is neither. Perhaps the international community is reaffirming our promise as practitioners of peace and diplomacy and protectors of human rights? Perhaps the Nobel committee sees the work undone and acknowledges at once both our imperfection and our desire to keep working? Obama has spoken with clarity about the quest for nuclear nonproliferation, dialogue and engagement in the Middle East, the aspirations of women in the Arab world, and the alleviation of disease and hunger in Africa and in this hemisphere. He began the difficult task of turning words into action for peace and justice, artfully balancing grit and diplomacy with Iran, North Korea, and in the Sudan. Our president is being recognized as a peacemaker and an inspiration for millions around the globe. But, this honor for the president is not just about the individual. We chose Obama as our face, our handshake extended to the world. In this peace prize, the world is expressing its gratitude for peace to come. Democratic strategist and senior fellow at New York University's Wagner School of Public Service Obama's winning the Nobel less than a year into his term shows how much the world values and welcomes affirmative and inspiring leadership from the president of the United States. On my plane Friday leaving Frankfurt for the Middle East, passengers were congratulating me as an American for this tribute to Obama -- and his proof that we are once again the America they hope for. All of us should take heart and pride from this. Despite the jeers about the Nobel from those who cheered our loss of the Olympics, what the prize represents is a powerful asset in the arsenal of our democracy. The way FDR, JFK and Ronald Reagan enlarged and conveyed the idea of America strengthened our influence and ideals around the globe, both while they were in office and long afterwards. In Obama, we have a president who commands such heights, not one who is disdained or despised -- and we are better for it. This was an extraordinary moment in a young presidency of high purpose that is renewing our country's international standing. But this is also a hard and unrelenting time, and Obama will have to re-earn his Nobel Prize everyday -- from North Korea to Iran and Iraq, and, in the coming weeks especially, Afghanistan. The prize doesn't tell him what decisions to make; it does tell us that we have a president with a new chance to lead in the world instead of going it alone. This Nobel is not premature; it comes at just the right time. Instead of simply witnessing history already made, it can help Obama bend history in the direction of our best hopes. Secretary of labor from 1993 to 1997; professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley President Obama's only real diplomatic accomplishment so far has been to change the direction and tone of American foreign policy from unilateral bullying to multilateral listening and cooperating. That's important, to be sure, but it's not nearly enough. Had the world not suffered eight years of George W. Bush, Obama would not have won the prize at this early stage of his presidency. I'd rather he had won it after Congress agreed to substantial cuts in greenhouse gases comparable to what Europe is proposing, after he brought Palestinians and Israelis together to accept a two-state solution, after he got the United States out of Afghanistan and reduced the nuclear arms threat between Pakistan and India, or after he was well on the way to eliminating the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons. Perhaps the Nobel committee can give him only half the prize now and withhold the other half until he accomplishes one or more of these crucial missions. Speechwriter to Vice President Dan Quayle; contributor to National Review Online's \\"The Corner\\" blog After the incredulity and snickering at a Nobel Prize for significant achievement in international affairs going to a promulgator of vaporous \\"hope,\\" with no foreign policy accomplishments, at time of multiple crises, the White House must respond delicately. Unfortunately, this is another instance for Obama of excessive reward for mere potential. He should be offended. Even the worst frauds on the past recipient list had to work a lot harder for their prizes. So aides owe the president a dose of reality. Otherwise, the prize may exacerbate his vanity and narcissism, which are his most visible flaws, and inflate his cult of personality, which won't create jobs or end wars. One hopes our president understands that the award is a bribe to continue apologizing for America, going soft on rogue nations and despots with nuclear goals, and backing away from the non-peaceful challenges of Afghanistan and Islamic extremism. If not, he'll learn when Americans next vote. The moment requires a nuanced, non-political performance. Obama must be able to convey genuine modesty. If that isn't in his repertoire, handlers should hire the best Broadway acting coach they can get. Oh, and donate the million bucks to a soup kitchen -- times being not so hopeful here at home. Every American has to be proud that President Obama has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. And there is, of course, an enormous amount that the president has done to end the United States' estrangement from the world community. But that being said, the prize was necessarily awarded more for what Obama has said he wants to accomplish than for any concrete achievements. Moreover, many of the tough decisions the president faces going forward involve the possible use of force -- in Afghanistan imminently, as well as potentially in Iran and even in North Korea if circumstances should require a change in approach in both regions. The most immediate impact of the prize is that it will burnish the president's image and stature, which have both been somewhat tarnished given the intractable challenges he is facing at home and abroad. The hope has to be that the president's enhanced image will make it easier to negotiate constructive settlements to ongoing conflicts as well as to begin to put in place a process to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict. At the same time, the president must remain resolute in his pursuit of America's interests around the world. That the Nobel Committee called Obama \\"the world's leading spokesman for its agenda\\" should not in any way obscure the fact that the president, no doubt, will have to make some very challenging decisions involving U.S. troops and the possible use of force in the weeks and months to come. White House staffer to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush; chairman of BGR Group I'm trying to be proud that my president has won the Nobel Peace Prize. But I have no idea what his accomplishment could be that deserves this or any other award. Shouldn't there be some positive contribution toward peace in a place where there is conflict? I think we should all be more embarrassed than proud. I assume Obama did not apply, but surely he could have quietly told the committee, \\"thanks, but no thanks\\" prior to a public announcement. But, if Ed McMahon just shows up at your door with balloons and the Nobel Prize, what are you supposed to do? Say no? I don't think the Nobel committee has done Obama any favors. Americans will see this as contrived and undeserved. It will breed resentment, and, for the first time, Obama may face every politicians' worst nightmare: ridicule. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about President Obama receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. People have different opinions about it. Some think it's a good thing that shows how much the world values and welcomes his leadership. Others think it's not a big achievement because they believe he hasn't done much for peace yet.

(ii) woman was many years older.","completion":"The man chose to retire before the woman did although the woman was many years older. This situation might raise some eyebrows or seem counterintuitive at first glance, but upon further examination, several factors could have contributed to this choice. Firstly, individual preferences differ when it comes to retirement age. The man may have had personal reasons for deciding to retire early, despite being younger than the woman. For instance, he might have been experiencing health issues or stress from work that prompted him to reevaluate his priorities and choose early retirement. Secondly, financial circumstances could have played a significant role. The man might have been more successful in his career than the woman, accumulating enough savings and investments that allowed him to retire comfortably while still being able to fulfill his financial obligations. On the other hand, the woman could have started her career or managed her finances later in life, or perhaps she had additional family responsibilities that required her to continue to work and contribute to the household for a longer period. Thirdly, career progression opportunities could also be a factor. The woman, despite being older, may still have felt professionally fulfilled and motivated to continue working, perhaps because of a recent promotion, an engaging work environment, or the opportunity to take on new challenges at her job. Meanwhile, the man may have felt like he had achieved all he could professionally or that he was not as satisfied with his career trajectory, which contributed to his decision to retire. It's important to consider gender dynamics as well. In some societies and professions, there may be more pressure on men to work and provide for the household, which could lead to earlier burnout and the desire to retire once financial independence is achieved. Women, on the other hand, might have faced other types of work-life challenges, including potential interruptions to their careers due to family and childcare responsibilities. In such cases, the woman may choose to continue working in order to make up for the lost time or capitalize on later-career opportunities. Lastly, personal ambitions and life goals could have influenced their decision. Perhaps the man was determined to retire early to embark on a new venture, such as starting his own business or pursuing an interest in a creative, philanthropic, or intellectual capacity outside his typical job setting. The woman, on the other hand, might have derived a strong sense of identity and purpose from her career, which led her to remain actively involved in her work even as she aged. In conclusion, the man's decision to retire before the woman, despite her being older, could be a result of a multitude of factors, including individual preferences, financial circumstances, career progression opportunities, gender dynamics, and personal ambitions. It's crucial to remember that everyone's life journey is unique, and what might be suitable for one person may not necessarily be the right fit for another."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As their bond deepened, Betty and Christine began to appreciate not only the power of cosmetics but also the strength of their friendship.

Q:Information: - The early - mid - 1990s English band Submarine followed in the footsteps of many of its contemporaries , including The Flaming Lips , Mercury Rev , Boo Radleys and My Bloody Valentine with its own vision of noise pop , before morphing into Jetboy DC , which continues sporadically to this day . - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Jonathan Daniel Donahue (born May 6, 1966 in Kingston, New York) is an American rock musician. He has been an integral member of two of North America's more influential indie/experimental bands of the 1990s; The Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev. - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music. - The Flaming Lips are an American rock band formed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1983. Instrumentally, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titlessuch as \\"What Is the Light? (An Untested Hypothesis Suggesting That the Chemical [In Our Brains] by Which We Are Able to Experience the Sensation of Being in Love Is the Same Chemical That Caused the \\"Big Bang\\" That Was the Birth of the Accelerating Universe)\\". They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, \\"Q magazine\\" named the Flaming Lips one of the \\"50 Bands to See Before You Die.\\" - Mercury Rev is an American indie rock band formed in 1989 in Buffalo, New York. Original personnel were David Baker (vocals), Jonathan Donahue (vocals, guitars), Sean Mackowiak, a.k.a. \\"Grasshopper\\" (guitars, clarinet), Suzanne Thorpe (flute), Dave Fridmann (bass) and Jimy Chambers (drums). - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\". - Buffalo is a city in western New York state and the county seat of Erie County, on the eastern shores of Lake Erie at the head of the Niagara River. , Buffalo is New York state's 2nd-most populous city after New York City, with 258,703 residents. The metropolitan area has a population of 1.13 million. - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Noise pop is a subgenre of alternative rock developed in the mid-1980s in the UK and US that mixes dissonant noise or feedback, or both, with the melodic instrumentation and production elements more often found in pop music, making it more melodic than noise rock. - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" / ; or transliterated from English as (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. - The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of HornbostelSachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones. - Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes. - David Lawrence \\"Dave\\" Fridmann is an American record producer and musician. From 1990 onwards he co-produced most releases by Mercury Rev and The Flaming Lips. Other bands he has worked with include Weezer, Saxon Shore, Neon Indian, Wolf Gang, Ammonia, Ed Harcourt, Sparklehorse, Café Tacuba, Elf Power, Mogwai, Thursday, Mass of the Fermenting Dregs, The Delgados, Low, Phantom Planet, Gemma Hayes, Goldrush, Tapes 'n Tapes, Hopewell, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Number Girl, Jed Davis, Zazen Boys, Sleater-Kinney and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. He has recently worked on new recordings with MGMT, Neil Finn, The Cribs, OK Go, Tame Impala, Baroness and Spoon. - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - The clarinet is a musical-instrument family belonging to the group known as the woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"In evaluating whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is vital to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the premise and the hypothesis and then analyze their connection. Premise: \\"And there are tax revolutions going on currently.\\" The premise asserts that there are ongoing tax revolutions at the present time. To better understand this statement, we need to clarify the term \\"tax revolutions.\\" A tax revolution refers to a significant shift or change in the tax system or taxation policies within a country or across multiple countries. This could involve changes in tax rates, implementation of new taxes, or the elimination of existing ones, modifications in tax collection methods, or the fundamental restructuring of the taxation system itself. Hypothesis: \\"Currently, there are tax revolutions.\\" The hypothesis essentially claims the same thing as the premise, asserting that there are tax revolutions taking place at the present time. The hypothesis concisely reiterates the idea of ongoing tax revolutions without any changes or qualifications. This means that the basic idea of tax revolutions occurring in the present moment is consistent across both statements. Analysis: Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Entailment, in logical terms, refers to the relationship between two statements where if one statement (the premise) is true, the other statement (the conclusion or hypothesis) must also be true. In this case, the premise and the hypothesis are focused on the same concept: the existence of ongoing tax revolutions. Given the parallel nature of the statements and their consistency in terms of the intended message, it can be concluded that the premise entails the hypothesis. This is because if the premise is indeed true and there are tax revolutions taking place currently, then it must also hold that the hypothesis is accurate in claiming that tax revolutions are happening at the present time. In summary, based on the evaluation of the content and context of both the premise and the hypothesis, the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis. The statement \\"And there are tax revolutions going on currently\\" essentially guarantees the truth of \\"Currently, there are tax revolutions,\\" as long as the premise is assumed to be true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but, only refer to those things that everybody depends upon ,for example, public services, governments, and all kinds of communities. A society must keep even the poorest and weakest members willing to help even the richest and strongest, so it is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics ( )and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. When this happens, it is time for the society to break down or fail. Theft, violence and war are things that can make a society break down. A new society may be formed out of the collapse of an old failed one when people of different kinds reach an agreement about fairness and are willing to live together in harmony again. To adapt to the society, people should make sure that their behavior can be supported by the society, that is to say, there must be some social rules on which citizens base what they do. However, some people take risks that the society will support them when they do whatever they intend to. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a court of appeal, which harms the society. Therefore we need a social contract which sets out rules for the society. One kind of the social contract is a constitution -which allows a jury or court to decide what is right or wrong according to the social rules. We know from the passage that _ A) Social fairness is very important for a society to survive \\" B) there must be a war to end an old society and build a new one C) only the poorest are willing to help the richest in a society D) the poor people in a society are always cheated by those wealthy ones A:","completion":"According to the passage, the correct statement is \\"A) Social fairness is very important for a society to survive\\". The text suggests that every society highly depends on the principles of fairness to make its members willing to assist each other, regardless of their social or economical status. When the social contract fails or when the sense of injustice dominates, society is likely to break down, leading to theft, violence, and even war. The text does not state that \\"there must be a war to end an old society and build a new one\\" (B). Instead, it says that a new society may be formed after the collapse of an old one, once people can agree upon fairness and live harmoniously again. The statement \\"only the poorest are willing to help the richest in a society\\" (C) is not suggested in the passage either. The passage emphasizes that a well-functioning society should keep all of its members - from the poorest to the richest - willing to offer help to one another. Finally, the passage does not claim that \\"the poor people in a society are always cheated by those wealthy ones\\" (D). It says society may start viewing those who have more as cheats when breakdowns in fairness occur, but it does not specify a continuous pattern of deception directed by the wealthy towards the poor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years. Whether such a deal can be done, Trump declared on Saturday, is something he will know almost... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Tom Corbett (Franco Nero) is a prospector who receives a message from a family friend named Carradine (Janos Bathra), telling him to return immediately to the home where he'd lived with his wealthy widowed mother. Years earlier upon her death, she left the house and land to Tom's brother Jeff, and insisted that Tom be sent away. Money was dispatched to him to support him, but her dying wish was that Tom stay away from Laramie Town. Neverless, Tom says goodbye to his foreman, Murray, and rides off.Upon arrival in Laramie Town, Tom finds the house where he grew up in derelict. Pigs and livestock wonder the wreckage where some people also live and work. Tom is told by two rough-looking thugs to leave because the land belongs to a man called Mr. Scott and warned to beware whenever he sees the Scott sign which is a big letter 'S' stamped onto a big letter 'J'.Riding back into town, Tom sees that the Scott sign is all over town, on the bank, the saloon, everywhere, and soon sees why the owners are feared. Jason Scott (John McDouglas), a wealthy businessman rides into the town square with his sadistic son Junior Scott (Nino Castelnuovo) with a posse of thugs surrounding them.

Answer the following question: The candidate who is longing for election to the highest office in the United States must be native-born American citizen who is at least 35 years old and who has lived in the United States for at least 14 years. The election course is complicated, and the road to the Oval Office is long. Potential candidates must present papers stating their intention to seek their party's recommendation; delegates then choose from among those running some months later at the national conferences. Before that, however, each state holds a primary election that determines how the state's voters want the party's delegates to vote. Methods of choosing the delegates vary from state to state. At the conferences, there are speeches and often heated discussions. It may take several rounds of voting before delegates can agree on a candidate. On the final day of the meeting, the presidential candidate announces his or her choice for vice president. Election Day, by law, is the Tuesday that follows the first Monday in November. On this day, registered voters may cast their votes for president, vice president, and candidates for other federal state, and local offices. The popular vote, however, does not determine who will be president. The president is chosen by a vote of the Electoral College, a group of 538 citizens from the 50 states and the District of Columbia who are chosen to cast votes for the president and vice president. The rules for choosing electors, as with the delegates, vary. Each state also decides whether its electoral votes must reflect the popular vote. The number of electors in each state is determined by the number of representatives and senators that a state sends to Congress and, therefore, may change every 10 years, depending on the results of the United States census . The winner must get at least 270 of the electoral votes when the Electoral College meets in December of the election year.

Jackson) promoting his two brands -- the \\"Booty Sweat\\" energy drink and \\"Bust-A-Nut\\" candy bar -- while performing his hit song, \\"I Love Tha' Pussy.\\" The first trailer shows action star Tugg Speedman's (Ben Stiller) latest film, Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, a film so much like its five predecessors that even the trailer narrator sounds shaky about it. In another trailer, funnyman Jeff \\"Fatty\\" Portnoy (Jack Black) plays every member of \\"America's favorite obese family\\" in the highly flatulent The Fatties: Fart 2. The final trailer, for a film called Satan's Alley, features Australian \\"five-time Oscar winner\\" Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and Tobey Maguire (as himself) as two monks who begin an impassioned affair.We are taken, via the narration of John \\"Four Leaf\\" Tayback (Nick Nolte), into a gruesome battle of the Vietnam War. This is actually a scene from Tropic Thunder, a big-budget adaptation of Tayback's wartime memoir. Starring as the central platoon are Speedman, Lazarus, Chino and Portnoy, as well as young character actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). To play the role of Sgt. Lincoln Osiris, an African American, Lazarus has dyed his skin dark and refuses to break character. (\\"I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary.\\") A take of Osiris crying over Tayback's (Speedman's) blown-off hands is ruined when Speedman is unable to cry and Lazarus dribbles uncontrollably into Speedman's face. The ruined take causes great frustration for the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan). The chaos is exacerbated when the film's pyrotechnics expert, Cody (Danny McBride), mistakes Cockburn's conniptions for a signal to set off several expensive explosions.Faux Access Hollywood clips reveal that Speedman's career has been on a downward spiral. In an attempt at Oscar-bait, Speedman had played the \\"retard\\" title character in a flop called Simple Jack, which is considered one of the worst films of all time.

There were about 1,000 flu sequences from 400 avian virus samples collected in 2010, yet the world poultry population was 21 billion, the journal reported Wednesday. Countries such as Indonesia, Russia, India and Mexico contributed few samples to an international virus database despite large poultry populations. Brazil, with a poultry population of 1.27 billion, did not collect any avian flu samples - nor did Morocco, the Philippines, Colombia, Ecuador, Algeria, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. The Nature report characterizes surveillance generally as ad hoc and reactive, responding to outbreaks or temporary projects rather than being consistent. That's a problem because global threats can emerge from a flu virus at any moment. Nature looked at avian and pig flu records at the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information's Influenza Virus Sequence Database between 2003 and 2011. This includes all subtypes of flu, not just the avian flu pandemic candidate H5N1. The database has seen a general increase in flu sequences deposited, but most of those sequences come from samples collected before 2003 or from the mid-2000s during an unusually prolific virus collection phase. Sylvie van der Werf, head of the Molecular Genetics of RNA Viruses lab at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, told Nature that there can be a huge time lag between the collection and sequencing of flu virus samples. The reason for this includes lack of funding for sequencing, although these costs are decreasing. And there's a lot of sequencing going on in retrospective research studies. And researchers often don't share their sequences until after they have published data about them. Sequences of such viruses should be given to public databases within three months, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Organization for Animal Health. Dr. Ian Lipkin, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, said he agrees that surveillance needs a boost. \\"Influenza surveillance is insufficient and inefficient,\\" he wrote in an e-mail. \\"International leadership and commitment are key to mitigating the threat of pandemic influenza to human health and food security.\\" Data from two experiments on the highly infectious H5N1 avian influenza are still on hold amid concerns that they could be used for terrorist purposes. A WHO committee said in February that these studies should be published in their full form, but did not decide when. Also last month, a study suggested that the death rate of H5N1 may be overblown. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Nature reports that there is not enough flu surveillance in the world, which can be a problem because global threats can emerge from a flu virus at any moment.

Plot: Malik, a young African American man pursuing his university degree, gets assigned a new roommate, James, in their dorm. James is white, hailing from a wealthy background and has never experienced racial diversity firsthand. Their contrasting worlds collide as they begin to share a living space. The first act explores the initial tensions between the two as they navigate their different cultural backgrounds and perceptions. Malik feels that James treats him differently because he's Black, while James remains blissfully unaware of the impact of his behavior. Malik's struggles to adapt to an predominantly white environment exacerbates the situation. The second act witnesses a change in the characters as they start to acknowledge their misunderstandings. Both of them become more aware of cultural norms, social issues around race, and their own biases. They jointly participate in a college \\"Unity Through Diversity\\" project, where they must interview people of various backgrounds, pushing them to step outside their comfort zones, resulting in meaningful exchanges. Towards the end, an incident on campus involving racial injustice propels the roommates to work together to promote change in their college community. As they team up to organize a peaceful protest, they lean on each other for support. A strong bond develops between Malik and James, now that they've gone beyond their differences and established mutual respect. In the final act, tragedy strikes as an altercation escalates at the protest, and James, while peacefully advocating for racial justice, is gravely injured. On seeing his roommate hospitalized, Malik realizes how far they have come in their journey to understanding and acceptance.

Productions during the 1980s included the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that remained in the repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992. At the same time the Arts Council was contemplating a cut in the number of opera performances in London, at the expense of ENO, rather than Covent Garden. By...

A palindrome is a string that is the same backwards as it is forwards. If the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 you should return the first character. Q: tktkttuuuu A:","completion":"A: In the given string \\"tktkttuuuu\\", the longest palindrome substring is \\"tktkt\\". To solve this problem, you can iterate through the string and for each character, expand outwards to find the longest palindrome substring that includes the current character. Do this for all the characters in the input string and keep track of the longest one found. Here are the steps: 1. Create a function to expand around the center and compare the left and right characters. If they match, continue expanding. Return the length of the palindrome substring found. 2. Initialize variables to store start and end positions of the longest palindrome substring found. 3. Iterate through the given string and for each character, call the expand-around-center function with the character as the center. Also, handle the case for even-length palindromes by considering the next character as a part of the center. 4. Update the start and end positions if a larger palindrome is found. 5. After the iteration, extract the longest palindrome substring using the start and end positions. Here's a python implementation of the above approach: \`\`\`python def longest_palindrome_substring(s: str) -> str: if len(s) == 0 or len(s) == 1: return s def expand_around_center(s: str, left: int, right: int) -> int: while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]: left -= 1 right += 1 return right - left - 1 start = 0 end = 0 for i in range(len(s)): len1 = expand_around_center(s, i, i) len2 = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1) max_len = max(len1, len2) if max_len > end - start: start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2 end = i + max_len // 2 return s[start:end + 1] string = \\"tktkttuuuu\\" result = longest_palindrome_substring(string) print(result) # Output: tktkt \`\`\` For the given string \\"tktkttuuuu\\", the function will return the longest palindrome substring \\"tktkt\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids.

Usage: Given the list of numbers, first, find the highest absolute value among them. Here, we will convert each number to its absolute value, and keep track of the highest absolute value we've encountered. In the given list of numbers, absolute values are [45.584, 26.748, 39.533, 83.255, 0.359, 1.64, 87.489, 53.57, 3.832, 70.333]. The highest absolute value is 87.489. Part #3: Return the original value of the element with the highest absolute value. Usage: After determining the highest absolute value, return the actual value of that element from the original list. In this case, the highest absolute value is 87.489, and its original value from the list was also 87.489. Therefore, the solution is 87.489, as it is the element with the maximum absolute value.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: John is a chemical engineer with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to develop a drug that can be absorbed by the system in different rates. To that end, he conducted two experiments. In one case, he used lower concentrations of reactants, he called it case A. Then he used the same reactants in a higher concentration. He called it case B. Would case A have higher or lower rate of reactions than case B? Hint: Collision theory tells us that molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place. All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products. Answer:","completion":"Based on the hint provided which refers to the Collision Theory, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of reactants. Higher concentrations of reactants lead to a higher frequency of collisions between the molecules, thus increasing the rate of reaction. In John's experiments: Case A involves lower concentrations of reactants. Case B involves higher concentrations of the same reactants. As per the Collision Theory, Case B will have a higher rate of reaction compared to Case A, because the higher concentration of reactants in Case B will result in more frequent collisions between the molecules, providing greater opportunities for the reactants to transform into products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Greeks can look to the examples of Argentina and Iceland to see what experience may await them after default and devaluation. But the fate of the eurozone is more complex and uncertain. With Greece making up less than 2% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), its exit might not have much of an immediate impact. Most economists expect the European Central Bank (ECB) would step in to support bond prices against market speculation targeting the weaker euro members. But after that? Some believe the crisis will impel the 19 countries using the euro to an even closer union. Others say the direct opposite, that the markets will pick off the weaker members one by one, reducing it to a euro-rump of diminished significance. We canvassed the opinions of four economists and thinkers on how they felt the euro would fare without Greece. Mr Borg believes the effect on the eurozone would be limited. \\"If you look at how the stock markets have been affected - it's really not that bad. The exposure to Greece from individual banks has been limited and although the links to Greek debts for public institutions is strong there are no solvency or liquidity problems. \\"It is very important we see appropriate policies put in place by the ECB. It needs to do what it is doing at the moment - monthly interventions in the market, clearly signalling that it will do whatever it takes to keep the euro together, and possibly even in the short term stepping up the amount they are injecting. \\"A Grexit would have a negative impact on the euro economy but not by a large amount, perhaps reducing growth by 0.2-0.4%, but nothing like the effect of 2008 or 2010 as balance sheets have been cleared up and there is considerably more growth.\\" Stefanos Manos said: \\"I don't think the consequences for the euro would be that severe and I believe the European institutions have ring-fenced everything that would be damaged by a Greek exit. The euro might wobble a bit but it would not be damaged. \\"It might instead scare people in Europe and force them to do more than they were going to do to create more of a union. Beside a banking union, they need some sort of fiscal union. So a Grexit would be a good reason to accelerate the process.\\" He believes Greece's future outside the euro would not encourage others to follow suit - in fact it would do the opposite: \\"We would be an example to avoid\\" he said. Prof Ryan believes that the effects in the short term will be damaging to the euro but manageable. But further out, he says there could be more serious problems. He said: \\"The effects could be incremental rather than immediate. The European Central Bank can sterilise the issue to start with, supporting the bond markets. But further out the markets will test the resilience of the periphery economies.\\" He also has less faith in the European banking system to withstand the impact of a Grexit. He said: \\"There have been stress tests done but there have been exemptions for some banks while others have not passed. I am not convinced they are as strong as they are made out to be.\\" Professor Ryan also doubts the ability of the euro members to forge a closer union. \\"The bottom line was that in the cold light of day they are realising there isn't a willingness to do what is necessary to create a proper monetary union, with a fiscal union and especially a transfer union - transferring money from the rich countries to the poor - which has no support at all in Germany\\". Vicky Pryce says she has always been sceptical of the eurozone's ability to function as a currency union without political union. She put the chances of its success as 50/50 when it was launched and says the chances are much the same now. She said: \\"A Grexit would not change anything. A monetary union was always going to be hard and I always imagined we would get the odd country dropping out. And the prospect of instability is likely to push the euro towards more integration, as it has been damaged by what it has been through.\\" \\"The euro will still face the problem of having interest rates set in Germany which are right for the large core economies but not for the countries on the periphery.\\" She believes the ECB will immediately flood the market with liquidity and make sure that the European banking system is safe. It would therefore put off any thought of a rise in interest rates. But she says it will be expensive: \\"There are some horrendous estimates coming out of German institutions of the costs of Greece defaulting on its debt. Even though a Grexit would bring with it some certainty for Greece it would bring uncertainty for the rest of Europe and that will weigh on growth.\\" This article was about:","completion":"The article discusses the potential impact of a Greek exit (Grexit) on the eurozone.

Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what is the last country mentioned? Context: During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent, the Carnatic Wars, as the English East India Company (the Company) and its French counterpart, the Compagnie française des Indes orientales, struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India. In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys.

First, we see an equation that looks a little complicated, but don't worry, it's like a puzzle, and we're going to solve it together. The equation is 51*k + 14215 - 17020 = 0. Now, before we find what \\"k\\" is, let's simplify the equation a bit. We have numbers 14215 and 17020. We're subtracting 17020 from 14215, which if we do the math, equal -2805. So, now our equation looks like this: 51*k - 2805 = 0 We want to find out what \\"k\\" is, right? To find the value of k, we might want to move -2805 to the other side of the equation. To move -2805 over to the other side, we do the opposite of subtraction, which is addition. So, we add 2805 to both sides. Our equation now looks like this: 51*k = 2805 The last step is to find out \\"k\\". Now, \\"k\\" is being multiplied by 51. To undo multiplication, we do division. So, we divide 2805 by 51.

Hypothesis: South Dakota elected a senator in 2014","completion":"To determine the validity of the hypothesis that South Dakota elected a senator in 2014, we must carefully examine the information provided in the paragraph. The paragraph states that the 2014 South Dakota gubernatorial election happened on November 4, 2014. During this election, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota were elected. However, the paragraph also mentions that this election was held concurrently with the election of South Dakota's Class II U.S. Senate seat. A U.S. Senate seat refers to a position held by a senator, with two senators representing each state. There are three classes for Senate seats, with each class consisting of approximately one-third of the total Senate seats. Class II seats, which South Dakota's was a part of in 2014, are elected every six years, with elections typically held in years that are evenly divisible by six (like 2014).

How does the sentence end? Talent, a 20-1 outsider, dominated rivals to capture the Oaks, the premier fillies' Classic of the season. The Ralph Beckett-trained filly made a brilliant last-to-first move in the home straight at Epsom under jockey Richard Hughes to lead home a talented field including stablemate Secret Gesture in second and The Lark in third. All the attention pre-race had been on Beckett's other runner, the Qatar Bloodstock-owned Secret Gesture. Qatar's Sheikh Fahad decided to buy a half-share in the filly just this week after her impressive 10-length victory in the Lingfield Oaks trial. The endorsement of one of the most competitive owners in the business helped propel her to early favorite in the markets, leaving Talent relatively unexposed. At the start of the season, veteran jockey Hughes had yet to capture an","completion":"Epsom Classic victory, but Talent's Oaks triumph provided him with the breakthrough that he had been striving for throughout his exceptional career. Overcoming a wide draw and seemingly insurmountable odds, Hughes showcased his superior horsemanship, strength, and poise as he guided Talent along the rail, deftly managing traffic and timing his move with absolute precision. As the race progressed, the two market leaders, Moth and Liber Nauticus, began to falter and lost pace, creating a dramatic shift in the competition. Never one to shy away from seizing an opportunity, Hughes urged Talent to surge forward with an unstoppable burst of speed down the home straight, leaving her rivals floundering in her wake. The breathtaking finish was testament not only to Talent's raw ability and determination but also to the skill and expertise of her trainer, Ralph Beckett. Having patiently crafted and nurtured a winning strategy, Beckett had every reason to celebrate as his charge crossed the line in style, delivering an important victory for his stable and validating all the hard work that had gone into Talent's preparation. And so, as the jubilant connections cheered on their heroic filly, the Oaks trophy was secured, and Richard Hughes finally achieved one of his lifelong ambitions – winning a prestigious Epsom Classic. A victory well deserved, given his successful racing career that spans over two decades, and throughout which he has consistently displayed an unwavering dedication to his craft. For Talent, the future appears bright, with many exciting prospects on the horizon. As she moves forward from this emphatic success, there is every reason to believe she will conquer even greater challenges in the months and years ahead. The exhilarating performance she delivered on that fateful day at Epsom will long be remembered as a defining moment in her blossoming career, a testament to the winning partnership between horse, jockey, and trainer, and an inspiration for the broodmares of future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Controversy persists over whether the Rus’ were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources. Attempts to address this question instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, legends and literature from centuries later. To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region. According to the \\"Normanist\\" view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs. Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Russian Primary Chronicle, although even this account was not produced until the 12th century. Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest. On balance, it seems likely that the Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs. Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.

For example, when he arrives at a Dublin hostel, Yu Ming says, \\"Ba mhaith liom leaba anseo\\" (\\"I would like a bed here\\").

The Finnish and Baltic invasions began a deterioration of relations between the Soviets and Germany. Stalin's invasions were a severe irritant to Berlin, as the intent to accomplish these was not communicated to the Germans beforehand, and prompted concern that Stalin was seeking to form an anti-German bloc. Molotov's reassurances to the Germans, and the Germans' mistrust, intensified. On June 16, as the Soviets invaded Lithuania, but before they had invaded Latvia and Estonia, Ribbentrop instructed his staff \\"to submit a report as soon as possible as to whether in the Baltic States a tendency to seek support from the Reich can be observed or whether an attempt was made to form a bloc.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did the Germans distrust the soviet agenda?","completion":"The Germans distrusted the Soviet agenda for several reasons: 1. Lack of communication: The Soviets launched invasions in Finland and the Baltic states without prior communication with the Germans. This lack of communication led to suspicion and uncertainty about Soviet intentions. 2. Ideological differences: Germany was led by Adolf Hitler who espoused the principles of National Socialism (Nazism), while the Soviet Union was led by Joseph Stalin promoting Communism. There was a long-standing ideological divide between the two, and each side viewed the other's political system as a threat to their own. 3. Non-Aggression Pact tensions: Despite signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (a non-aggression treaty) in 1939, both sides remained wary of each other's true intentions. The fact that the Soviets pursued aggressive actions that were not previously discussed with Germany fueled their distrust. 4. Fear of anti-German bloc: Following the Soviet invasions, Germany worried that Stalin might be attempting to form an anti-German bloc with nations in the region, which would oppose and potentially undermine German ambitions. 5. Conflicting territorial interests: Although the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact had divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence between Germany and the Soviet Union, the division did not eliminate their territorial ambitions. German concerns that the Soviets might not honor the agreed-upon division of territories fueled their mistrust. In summary, the Germans distrusted the Soviet agenda due to a combination of factors, including lack of communication, ideological differences, tensions over the non-aggression pact, fears of Soviet attempts to form an anti-German bloc, and conflicting territorial interests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They soon run into trouble, first narrowly avoiding another motorist, then having a sudden scare as the bridge near the cabin begins to collapse as they cross. That night, while Cheryl is making a drawing of a clock, her hand becomes violently possessed by a mysterious entity, causing her to draw a picture that looks like a book with a deformed, evil face. She fails to mention the incident to the others, dismissing it as her imagination. When the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty go down to investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recording of incantations in which, when played by Ash then Scotty, unleashes demons and evil spirits. Cheryl becomes hysterical when a tree crashes through the window, and she runs to her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. She is attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. The others do not believe her story, but Ash agrees to drive her to town where she can find a place to stay for the night. However, they find that the only bridge connecting the cabin to the rest of the world has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape and while the girls play cards, Cheryl then becomes demonically possessed, telling them that the demons will kill them. She then stabs Linda in the ankle with a pencil, and Scotty locks her in the cellar. Shelly is the next to become possessed; she attacks Scotty, who eventually dismembers her with an felling axe. They bury her, and a shaken Scotty leaves to find an alternate trail through the woods. Checking on Linda, Ash discovers that she too became possessed. Scotty...

Living in a modern Australian city is not very different from living in an American city. But there are some differences on farms. In many parts of the world, farmers and their families live in villages or towns. In the United States, each farm family lives in its own fields. Usually their neighbours live far away. It's hard for them to see each other on weekdays. Their children take school buses to the nearest schools. These schools are only for the farm families in this area. In some areas, there are small schools for a few farm families, and the children walk to schools. Life keeps changing for everyone, so do farmers. Today there are cars, good roads, radios, television sets and there are modern machines for farming. All of these are changing farm life.

Given the question: Information: - The Randstad is a megalopolis in the central-western Netherlands consisting primarily of the four largest Dutch cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht) and their surrounding areas. Among other things, it contains the Port of Rotterdam (the largest seaport in Europe, and until 2004 also the world's busiest seaport), and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (one of the largest European airports). With a population of 7,100,000 it is one of the largest metropolitan regions in Europe, comparable in size to Milan or the San Francisco Bay Area, and covers an area of approximately 8,287 km². It's also one of the most important and densely populated economic areas in northwestern Europe. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - South Holland is a province in the midwestern Netherlands. It has a population of just over 3.6 million (as of 2015) and a population density of about , making it the country's most populous province and one of the world's most densely populated areas. Situated on the North Sea in the west of the Netherlands, South Holland covers an area of , of which is water. It borders North Holland to the north, Utrecht and Gelderland to the east, and North Brabant and Zeeland to the south. The provincial capital is The Hague, while its largest city is Rotterdam. - Mijnsheerenland is a village on the Hoeksche Waard in the Dutch province of South Holland with 4,435 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2006).

The island is a mostly agricultural region, south of Rotterdam. The Hoeksche Waard consists of reclaimed land (polders): after the Saint Elisabeth flood of 1421 most of the area was flooded. The land has been reclaimed gradually in the following centuries. - The Scheldt (, ) is a long river in northern France, western Belgium and the southwestern part of the Netherlands. Its name is derived from an adjective corresponding to Old English \\"sceald\\" \\"shallow\\", Modern English \\"shoal\\", Low German \\"schol\\", Frisian \\"skol\\", and Swedish (obsolete) \\"skäll\\" \\"thin\\". - North Holland (, West Frisian: \\"Noard-Holland\\") is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands.

The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about . - Rotterdam is a city in the Netherlands, located in South Holland, within the RhineMeuseScheldt river delta at the North Sea. Its history goes back to 1270 when a dam was constructed in the Rotte river by people settled around it for safety. In 1340 Rotterdam was granted city rights by the Count of Holland and slowly grew into a major logistic and economic centre. Nowadays it is home to Europe's largest port and has a population of 633,471 (city proper), ranking second in the Netherlands. The Greater Rijnmond area is home to approximately 1.4 million people and the Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Area makes for the 168th most populous urban area in the world.

Firing an RPG at steep angles poses a danger to the user, because the backblast from firing reflects off the ground.

The given statement, \\"A man in an orange shirt is jumping while playing a large drum,\\" provides information about the man's actions and his clothing, but it does not give any information about his age. Therefore, it is not possible to deduce if the man is old or not based on the information given. From the statement, we understand that the man is capable of jumping and playing a large drum simultaneously, which could point to his physical abilities. However, these actions do not necessarily provide enough context or definitive evidence to determine his age. It is not uncommon for people of various age groups to engage in such activities, as age may not be a significant determinant of one's ability to perform these actions. Health, fitness levels, and personal interests can be factors that could influence the man's actions, regardless of his age. In conclusion, due to the lack of information regarding the man's age in the provided statement, it is not possible to reliably determine if the man is old or not.

Q:Question: \\"What had a result of the media being able to say whatever they wanted?\\" Context: \\"The trial in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger in 1735 helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America. In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King's College in Lower Manhattan. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The result of the media being able to say whatever they wanted, following the trial of John Peter Zenger in 1735, led to the establishment of freedom of the press in North America. This freedom played a significant role in shaping the history and politics of the region. Before the Zenger trial, the press was heavily censored, and any criticism of the government was punishable by law. The Zenger trial marked the beginning of the press's ability to report on and critique the actions of government officials, providing the public with information that held authorities accountable and transparent. As a consequence, newspapers began to proliferate, and the colonies were exposed to different perspectives and ideas, including those advocating for independence from Britain. The freedom of the press proved to be an essential factor in the run-up to the American Revolutionary War. Newspapers, pamphlets, and other forms of media provided information and rallied support for the Patriot cause. This free circulation of information bolstered the colonial opposition to British rule and played a significant role in the ratification of the United States Constitution, which enshrined the right to freedom of speech and press in the First Amendment. In summary, the media being able to say whatever they wanted as a result of the Zenger trial led to the establishment of freedom of the press in North America. This freedom played a critical role in the formation of an informed society, shaping politics, and influencing events such as the American Revolution and the adoption of the United States Constitution."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chris Wormald told a Commons committee it was a controversial move but already happened in some NHS trusts. The NHS has \\"a lot further to go\\" in reclaiming money for treating foreign visitors, he said. Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier raised concerns that some British residents might not have passports or other ID. Head of the BMA council Dr Mark Porter said the discussions were a distraction given that so-called health tourism was \\"such a small problem\\" for the NHS. NHS Trusts in England are legally obliged to check whether patients are eligible for free non-emergency NHS treatment and to recover any costs from overseas patients. But this does not always happen. The government estimates £2bn a year is spent on treating overseas visitors - and only about £280m of this is thought to be deliberate health tourism whereby people come from abroad specifically to get free treatment they are not entitled to. The figure includes the cost of GP care, emergency treatment and routine hospital services, such as scans, maternity care and non-emergency operations. The government has focused on recouping money on routine hospital care. It set a target of recovering £500m a year by 2017-18, but is behind schedule. In 2014-15, when it set the goal, the NHS recovered just £97m. A year later that had increased to £289m, but most of that - £164m - came from the introduction of health surcharge on visa applications of £150 for students and £200 for other people. This entitles them to free NHS care. However, hospitals have struggled to significantly increase the amount they recover from patients they should be charging. UK residents and asylum seekers are entitled to free treatment. But the governments of patients from within the European Economic Area should be charged for the treatment they receive, while visitors from outside that area should be charged personally if they have not paid the surcharge. St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, is currently running a pilot scheme to test new proof-of-ID processes to recoup costs from pregnant overseas patients. Mr Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, which is responsible for the NHS in England, told the Public Accounts Committee: \\"We have some trusts that are looking at asking for two forms of ID before treatment. \\"Now that is obviously quite a controversial thing to do but... those are the kinds of things we want to look at. \\"We don't have evaluated results of those yet, but what those trusts are reporting is that does lead to an increase in identification.\\" He added: \\"There are individual trusts like Peterborough who are doing that, who are reporting that it makes a big difference and there you are saying, 'Please come with two forms of identity, your passport and your address,' and they use that to check whether people are eligible or not. \\"Now it is obviously quite a controversial thing to do to say to the entire population, 'You now have to prove identity.'\\" But Ms Hillier said she had constituents who had no photo ID. She said: \\"Because they have never travelled, they have no passport; they have no driver's licence because they have never driven, they still live at home because they can't afford to move out so they've never had a utility bill in their name. \\"Perfectly entitled to health care, British born, British resident; how are you going to make sure that people have access easily to the National Health Service without having to go through a very humiliating and impossible-to-meet set of demands?\\" Mr Wormald responded: \\"This is why we are going very slowly on some of these questions and individual trusts are trying these out.\\" Dr Porter told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \\"Why are we discussing this today? We've got an Autumn Statement tomorrow, we've got an NHS with a deficit opening up over the course of this Parliament because of the funding decisions taken about how to address resources in the NHS. \\"This is little other than a pinprick on the top of the actual problems facing the NHS.\\" A Department of Health spokesman said: \\"The NHS is a national - not an international - health service and we are determined to stamp out abuse of the system to ensure it remains free at the point of need in this country. \\"We consulted earlier this year on extending the charging of migrants and visitors using the NHS. We will set out further steps in due course.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the possibility of requiring patients to present two forms of identification before receiving treatment from the UK's National Health Service (NHS), as a way to ensure costs can be recouped from overseas patients. The NHS in England is already legally required to check patients' eligibility for free non-emergency treatment and recover costs where applicable.

Also, they do not want to drive back home which implies they are somewhere where going back home would interrupt their day. This is likely to be a job.

Article: There’s a common myth that if you’ve had chickenpox once, you can never get it again. Unfortunately, because VZV stays in your body the rest of your life, this simply isn’t true – though once you’ve had chickenpox, the virus usually returns as shingles. Even children can develop shingles if they’re exposed to the virus. Most people only get shingles once, but it is possible to develop an outbreak of shingles multiple times throughout your life. The Shingles virus is not sexually transmitted or spread through sneezing or coughing. Rather, it is transmitted by touching the shingles blisters or fluid from the blisters. If you have been around someone in the blister-phase of the infection, you should wash your hands thoroughly; avoid touching anyone else’s rash. A person is not contagious before the blisters appear or once the blisters have crusted over completely. Keeping the blisters covered lowers the risk of transmitting the virus. If you have never had chickenpox and come in contact with someone with shingles, you can get VZV – but you’ll get chickenpox, not shingles. (However, you can then get shingles later in life.) Most cases of shingles occur in adults over the age of 60. You are also at higher risk of getting shingles if you have a weakened immune system. This may be due to: Cancer treatment with chemotherapy or radiation Lymphoma or leukemia Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) Taking immunosuppressive medications like steroids or drugs given after an organ transplant If you are 60 years old or over, you should get the shingles vaccine to reduce your risk of contracting the disease. Being unvaccinated after age 60 is a risk-factor for most people. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about whether the shingles vaccine is right for you. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article: While many believe that having chickenpox once prevents future occurrences, the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) actually stays in the body for life, often returning as shingles. Shingles, not transmitted sexually or through air, spreads by touching the blisters or the fluid from them. Chickenpox is a potential consequence for those never infected but exposed to someone with shingles. Most shingles cases occur in adults over 60 or people with weakened immune systems. If you are over 60, getting vaccinated for shingles is recommended to reduce the risk of contracting the disease. Consult your doctor to address any concerns about the shingles vaccine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: name = Zizzi, eatType = coffee shop, priceRange = more than £30, customer rating = low, area = riverside Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","completion":"Absolutely, the content in the given sentence can be represented in a structured data form. This would typically be achieved by employing a tabular layout, where each attribute mentioned in the sentence corresponds to a specific column and the provided information will be retained in rows under the corresponding columns. For example, if we translate your sentence into a table, each component of the restaurant ('name', 'eatType', 'priceRange', 'customer rating', 'area') becomes a field or a column header. The specific information provided (Zizzi, coffee shop, more than £30, low, riverside) is then represented as a row of data under the appropriate column header respectively. Here is a basic representation of the data: | Name | EatType | PriceRange | CustomerRating | Area | | ------- | ------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------- | | Zizzi | Coffee Shop | More Than £30 | Low | Riverside| Alternatively, the information could also be stored in numerous different data structures for various uses. If the data is needed for a manipulated programming task, it could perhaps be represented as a dictionary in Python: \`\`\`python restaurant_info = { \\"Name\\": \\"Zizzi\\", \\"EatType\\": \\"Coffee Shop\\", \\"PriceRange\\": \\"More Than £30\\", \\"CustomerRating\\": \\"Low\\", \\"Area\\": \\"Riverside\\" } \`\`\` This standard structure allows for easy access and modification of your data in a programming context.

Jeffries and Ryan argue that no-aid position drew support from a coalition of separationist opinion. Most important was \\"the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life,\\" which sought to confine religion to a private sphere. Further, the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants (and most Jews), who opposed aid to religious schools, which were mostly Catholic at the time. After 1980, however, anti-Catholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants, and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed. While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state, much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position. As a consequence, strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths, even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics.[citation needed] What position do Jeffries and Ryan argue was the reason for support from a coalition of separationists?

Do these questions have the same meaning? What are some of the weirdest dreams you've ever had? What are the strangest and most unusual dreams you have ever experienced?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are essentially asking the same thing, but they use slightly different words to convey the same meaning. Both questions are inquiries about the peculiar and extraordinary dreams that the person being asked has experienced. Let's break down each question to further understand their similarities: 1) \\"What are some of the weirdest dreams you've ever had?\\" This question uses the term \\"weirdest\\" to denote the bizarre nature of the dreams being asked about. In this context, the speaker is curious about dreams that may be abnormal, inexplicable, or eccentric. The use of \\"some\\" indicates that they are open to hearing about multiple dreams and not just one specific dream. 2) \\"What are the strangest and most unusual dreams you have ever experienced?\\" Here, the question uses the terms \\"strangest\\" and \\"unusual\\" as descriptors for the dreams being asked about. \\"Strangest\\" is similar to \\"weirdest\\" and refers to anything that is odd, peculiar, or out of the ordinary, while \\"unusual\\" highlights the atypical aspect of the dreams. The word \\"experienced\\" is used instead of \\"had\\" to emphasize the person's recollection of the dreams, but it does not change the overall meaning. Although the two questions employ slightly different phrasing, they both probe for peculiar dreams with a sense of curiosity and interest in learning about unique or out-of-the-ordinary experiences.

The man with cancer chooses surgery over chemo based on his doctor's advice.","completion":"The man, named Lawrence, decided to follow his doctor's advice and go for surgery over chemo. This decision was not made lightly, as he weighed the pros and cons of each option and considered the long-term impact on his life. Ultimately, he trusted his doctor's experience and expertise and believed that this would give him the best chance of beating his cancer. Step 1: Preparing for surgery Before the surgery, Lawrence needed to undergo several tests and medical evaluations to ensure he was physically ready for the procedure. These tests included blood work, imaging scans, and consultations with the surgical team. The medical team explained the details of the surgery, its risks, potential complications, and recovery process. They also discussed potential lifestyle changes and the importance of emotional support during the difficult journey ahead. Step 2: Undergoing surgery As the day of the surgery approached, Lawrence was filled with a mixture of anxiety and hope. He knew that this was a critical step in his battle against cancer and that his life would never be quite the same again after this procedure. The surgery was performed by a team of experienced surgeons who had a proven track record in successfully treating similar cases. They worked diligently to remove the cancerous tumor and any nearby lymph nodes that may have been affected. Step 3: Recovery and rehabilitation After the surgery, Lawrence faced a long road to recovery. While the procedure had been successful in removing the tumor, he now had to deal with the physical and emotional consequences of the surgery. This involved several weeks in the hospital, followed by ongoing rehabilitation and physical therapy. Lawrence had to re-learn basic tasks like walking, eating, and dressing himself, and adjusting to the limitations that the surgery had imposed on his body. Step 4: Ongoing monitoring Once Lawrence was finally discharged from the hospital, his journey was far from over. He would need regular check-ups with his healthcare team to monitor his condition and ensure that there was no sign of the cancer returning. This vigilance was crucial as it would ensure that any potential issues were detected early and dealt with promptly. Step 5: Emotional and social support During his recovery and rehabilitation process, Lawrence realized the importance of emotional and social support in his life. His friends, family, and even fellow patients battling cancer all provided the essential encouragement and understanding that he needed to get through this difficult period. In turn, Lawrence began to actively participate in cancer support groups, both in-person and online, sharing his experience and offering comfort to others facing similar challenges. In the end, Lawrence emerged from his battle with cancer a changed man. While the journey may have been filled with struggle and hardship, the unwavering support of his loved ones and fellow cancer patients, as well as his own resilience and determination, allowed him to find a renewed sense of purpose and hope in his life. He vowed to become an advocate for cancer awareness and dedicate his time to helping others facing this devastating disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility. Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Marugeâs case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. Following negative feedback... A:","completion":"The villagers believe that Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. This belief stems from the unconventional situation of an 84-year-old man, Maruge, attending a primary school alongside young children. As Maruge's story becomes national headlines and attracts media attention, the villagers start to question the true intentions of both Maruge and Jane, the principal and teacher who supports Maruge's educational pursuit. The villagers' skepticism about Maruge's pursuit of education is fueled not only by his age but also by the disruption it has caused in the school. With a focus on Maruge's education, they worry that the needs and education of the younger students may become compromised. Additionally, as media attention intensifies, the villagers become increasingly concerned that Jane and Maruge are taking advantage of the situation for personal gain, such as financial benefits and increased social status. However, it is important to recognize that the villagers' views are formed based on their perception and interpretation of the situation. While they may see Maruge's pursuit of education as a selfish act or attention-seeking behavior, both Maruge and Jane genuinely believe in the importance of education for all, regardless of age. Maruge seeks to learn how to read and enhance his knowledge, driven by a desire for self-improvement and understanding of the world. In conclusion, the villagers believe that Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children's education. This belief is rooted in the disruption caused by Maruge's attendance at the primary school and the subsequent media attention. However, it is essential to consider the genuine intentions behind Maruge and Jane's actions, which is to promote education and lifelong learning for all individuals, regardless of age or background."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which country contributed less to the irreversible damage our environment? Two countries used different fuels as power sources for their activities. Alsacia used fossil fuels, while Lorena devised more advanced energy storage devices, therefore relying on electricity. Hint: There is worldwide concern about the relationship between climate change and the use of fossil fuels. Many scientists believe that increased use of these fuels (in vehicles and other gas-powered equipment) has the potential to irreversibly damage our environment. In addition to the environmental concerns, supplies of fossil fuels are finite, and because they are non-renewable energy sources, we will eventually need alternatives. New developments in batteries and other energy storage devices are being explored to help deal with these issues. Electrochemical processes are at the heart of these new technologies. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information and hint, Lorena contributed less to the irreversible damage of our environment. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Lorena relied on advanced energy storage devices, thus utilizing electricity as their primary source of power. In contrast, Alsacia used fossil fuels, which are known to have a significant negative impact on the environment and are responsible for contributing substantially to climate change. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and cause global temperatures to rise. This process is largely responsible for human-driven global warming and has the potential to cause irreversible environmental damage if continued unchecked. Additionally, fossil fuels are finite and non-renewable resources, meaning that their supplies will eventually run out, necessitating the development of alternative sources of energy. On the other hand, electricity can be generated from renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, which produce minimal emissions and have a reduced environmental impact compared to fossil fuels. Lorena's use of advanced energy storage devices and electricity demonstrate a more environmentally conscious approach to their power needs and, as a result, contributed less to the irreversible damage of our environment when compared to Alsacia's reliance on fossil fuels."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pink Floyd - The Wall is a 1982 British live-action/animated musical drama film directed by Alan Parker with animated segments by political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, and is based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album of the same name. The film centers around a confined rocker named Pink, who, after being driven into insanity by the death of his father and many depressive moments during his lifetime, constructs a metaphorical (and sometimes physical) wall to be protected from the world and emotional situations around him. When this coping mechanism backfires he puts himself on trial and sets himself free. The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters. In the mid-1970s, as Pink Floyd gained mainstream fame, Waters began feeling increasingly alienated from their audiences: Audiences at those vast concerts are there for an excitement which, I think, has to do with the love of success. When a band or a person becomes an idol, it can have to do with the success that that person manifests, not the quality of work he produces. You don't become a fanatic because somebody's work is good, you become a fanatic to be touched vicariously by their glamour and fame. Stars--film stars, rock 'n' roll stars--represent, in myth anyway, the life as we'd all like to live it. They seem at the very centre of life. And that's why audiences still spend large sums of money at concerts where they are a long, long way from the stage, where they are often very uncomfortable, and where the sound is often very bad. Waters was also dismayed by the \\"executive approach\\", which was only about success, not even attempting to get acquainted with the actual persons of whom the band was comprised (addressed in an earlier song from Wish You Were Here, \\"Have a Cigar\\"). The concept of the wall, along with the decision to name the lead character \\"Pink\\", partly grew out of that approach, combined with the issue of the growing alienation between the band and their fans. This symbolised a new era for rock bands, as Pink Floyd \\"explored (... ) the hard realities of 'being where we are'\\", drawing upon existentialists, namely Jean-Paul Sartre.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Article: Like other settled, agrarian societies in history, those in the Indian subcontinent have been attacked by nomadic tribes throughout its long history. In evaluating the impact of Islam on the sub-continent, one must note that the northwestern sub-continent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia. In that sense, the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar to those of the earlier invasions during the 1st millennium. What does however, make the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes. This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature, though different from both the ancient Indian culture and later westernized modern Indian culture. At the same time it must be noted that overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam. This factor also played an important role in the synthesis of cultures. Question: After a history of raiding groups, what is not remarkable in the history of the subcontinent?","completion":"The unremarkable aspect in the history of the sub-continent, as mentioned in the article, is the nature of intrusions and invasions by Muslims, which were not different or unique compared to the earlier intrusions by various tribes during the 1st millennium.

Then he flew to Rome. There the sky was as clear as you could get at night. David was very happy about it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which place the Earth's surface would cool down slower, London or Rome? Hint: Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the Earth's surface would cool down slower in London compared to Rome. This is because it was overcast all night in London, meaning there were clouds present in the sky. Clouds are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation, which helps to retain heat near the Earth's surface. In contrast, the sky in Rome was clear, leading to faster cooling of the Earth's surface as there were no clouds to trap the heat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Joy had a field full of flowering plants , that he used for medicinal and honey making purposes. Her friend Jill also had a piece of land where she cultivated plants that fertilize over wind spread pollen. Which friend had a field that attracted fewer insects? Hint: Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar. Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the question and given hint The question asks us to determine which friend's field attracts fewer insects. Step 2: Identify and compare the types of plants on the two friends' fields Joy's field: flowering plants used for medicinal and honey-making purposes. Jill's field: plants that fertilize over wind-spread pollen. Step 3: Consider the hint provided In the hint, we learn that flowers evolved to attract insect pollinators by offering rewards like nectar in exchange for pollination. This made fertilization more efficient compared to wind-based pollination. Step 4: Identify which field is more likely to attract insects based on the hint Based on the hint, we can infer that flowering plants attracting insects would be Joy's field, since the plants she grew have traits meant to attract insects for pollination. Jill's field has plants that rely on wind to spread pollen, which suggests that they may not have evolved as many traits to attract insects. Step 5: Answer the question Since Joy's field has flowering plants which are evolved to attract insects, and Jill's field has plants that rely on wind for pollination (implying they are less likely to have traits specifically aimed at attracting insects), we can conclude that Jill's field attracts fewer insects.

When we add them together, we get: 15005 - 2014 + 20985 = 12991 + 20985 = 33976 So our equation changes to: 0 = 1096*y + 33976 Now we need to get y alone on one side. To do this, we'll subtract 33976 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 33976 = 1096*y - 33976 -33976 = 1096*y Almost there! Now, we just need to divide both sides by 1096 to find the value of y: -33976 ÷ 1096 = y And when we do the division, we get: y = -31 So, the answer is y = -31.

Later, it emerged a second police officer is being treated for minor symptoms, including skin irritation, after contact with an object believed to have had \\"secondary contamination\\" from the nerve agent, reports the Telegraph.

They are both about the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (LOTR) franchise, but they deal with different aspects of it. Question 1 is asking whether the cast of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films got matching tattoos. This question is about the real-life actions of the actors involved in the production. It is not about the plot, characters, or events within the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" narrative itself. In response to Question 1, the answer is \\"yes\\". The main cast of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" decided to commemorate their time filming together by getting matching tattoos. The nine members of the fellowship (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, and John Rhys-Davies' stunt double) each got a small tattoo of the Elvish character '9', designed by Alan Lee, in various places on their bodies. The tattoos represent the number nine in the Tengwar script, symbolizing the nine members of the fellowship of the ring. Question 2, on the other hand, is asking for an opinion on what the worst change director Peter Jackson made to J.R.R. Tolkien's original \\"Lord of the Rings\\" plot in his film adaptations. This question requires an understanding of both the original \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books and the film adaptations. It is also more subjective, as what one person believes is the 'worst' change might not be considered as such by someone else. Addressing question 2 would require a detailed examination of both the film and book versions of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" identifying key differences, and then making a judgment about which of those differences represents a negative alteration of Tolkien's original plot. Opinions on this can vary widely, depending on one's interpretation of the movies and books. Some may take issue with the omission of certain characters (such as Tom Bombadil), alterations to character personalities or roles (Faramir's portrayal), or the addition of scenes not present in the books (like the action-oriented sequence involving the Hobbits and the wargs).

Q:Information: - Berkshire (or , abbreviated Berks) is a county in south east England, west of London. It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading. - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus. - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished. Many towns and some cities in otherwise rural districts are also unparished areas and therefore no longer have a town council or city council. Some cities and towns which are unparished areas in larger districts (i.e. not districts of themselves) have charter trustees to maintain a historic charter, such as city status (an example being in Bath) or simply the mayoralty of a town. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - Holyport (pronounced \\"Hollyport\\") is a village in the civil parish of Bray (where at the 2011 Census the population was included), about 2 miles south of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire. - Ockwells Manor is a timber - framed 15th century manor house in the civil parish of Cox Green , adjoining Maidenhead , in the English county of Berkshire .

It sits on the left bank of the River Thames, facing Maidenhead in the neighbouring county of Berkshire, and is roughly west of Burnham and west of Charing Cross in London. - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry. - Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as \\"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\\". Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \\"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\\" design. - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\". - Pinkneys Green is a village within the north-western bounds of the town of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire.

It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created. - Uummannaq Fjord is a large fjord system in the northern part of western Greenland, the largest after Kangertittivaq fjord in eastern Greenland.

The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or \\"essential\\" identity, instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out, and hence become, the roles they play. Finally, the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self, and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others.

In this case, we need to combine the terms with the variable h. So, let's add 35h and 26h together: 0 = (35h + 26h) - 366 0 = 61h - 366 Now, our equation has been simplified as 0 = 61h - 366. To solve for h, we need to isolate the variable h by moving all other terms to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will first add 366 to both sides of the equation, which will cancel out the -366 term: 0 + 366 = 61h - 366 + 366 366 = 61h Now, we need to isolate h by dividing both sides of the equation by 61: 366 / 61 = 61h / 61 6 = h Now, we have found the value of h, which is 6.

As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany.

Here is a news article: In December of last year, a time when Paul Ryan must have known that he would be on any candidate's V.P. short list, Time approached the Wisconsin congressman about posing for a series of intimate weightlifting photos, and he was like, \\"Yeah, sure, I can't see why not.\\" Somehow, Time managed to hold off releasing them until now, in its latest issue, which probably took a lot of willpower because, well, look at this photo.

Paul Ryan, the Republican nominee for vice president, was nominated for Time Magazine's Person of the Year in 2012. He didn't win the honor, but he did pose for a photo shoot about his P90x workout routine. The photos, which were never published before now, are being featured in a profile of the candidate in this week's issue. The photos appeared online for the first time today, and netizens have reacted both accordingly and predictably. Political Twitter parody accounts are all the rage right now, which makes the nearly immediate creation of the twitter account @PaulRyansBicep an obvious choice. The account has been tweeting gems such as this one for the past hour: Has a VP candidate ever worn a sleeveless tee to a debate? — Paul Ryan's Bicep (@PaulRyansBicep) October 11, 2012 Other people have just taken to playfully poking fun at the photos on Twitter, creating memes and compiling image mashups.

You can mark this as one more data point in the critical debate over Ryan's workout routine, his unbelievable 6 percent body fat, and whether it's better to be jacked or ripped. Unfortunately, the Time photos do not display Ryan's wildly famous but as-yet-unseen killer abs. The photos were taken in December last year, when Ryan was a finalist for the magazine's Person of the Year, and when documenting his elusive abs was not such a pressing election issue. Gazing at Ryan's admirable muscle mass, you can't help but think of Sarah Palin's modeling of tights and shortish shorts for Runner's World. Both are a slightly awkward, somewhat self-conscious attempt to bring some youth and sexiness to a Republican brand. But Palin, at least, waited until June 2009 -- when it was safe to fan speculation about her own presidential candidacy long after John McCain lost the 2008 race. The day of the vice-presidential debate, Ryan might not want to encourage that comparison. Want to add to this story?

Context: In 1968 Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published The Sound Pattern of English (SPE), the basis for generative phonology. In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.

In February 1918, the Montana legislature had passed the Montana Sedition Act, which was a model for the federal version. In combination, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, military, or symbols through speech or other means. The Montana Act led to the arrest of over 200 individuals and the conviction of 78, mostly of German or Austrian descent. Over 40 spent time in prison. In May 2006, then-Governor Brian Schweitzer posthumously issued full pardons for all those convicted of violating the Montana Sedition Act.

The Espionage Act of 1917, Sedition Act of 1918, and the Montana Sedition Act were like new rules added to the game by the people in charge, called the government. These new rules said that people couldn't say mean things or criticize the U.S. government, the people who protect the country, or special symbols, like the flag. A lot of people, especially those who came from Germany or Austria, got in trouble because of these rules. They were like being put in time-out, and some even had to stay in a place called prison. Many years later, a man named Brian Schweitzer, who was the boss of Montana, said \\"sorry\\" to those people and fixed the problem by giving them something called a pardon, which is like erasing the time-out they had. So, these acts changed the rules and made it so that people weren't allowed to say certain things or criticize the government, but later they realized it wasn't the best idea and tried to make it right."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who by 10 September he had glued the Portland Vase whole again?, using the article: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

John Einarson has noted that the influence of Coltrane's saxophone playing and, in particular, his song \\"India\\" from the Impressions album, can be clearly heard in \\"Eight Miles High\\"--most noticeably in McGuinn's recurring twelve-string guitar solo. In addition to this striking guitar motif, the song is also highlighted by Chris Hillman's driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky rhythm guitar playing and the band's ethereal harmonies. \\"Eight Miles High\\" also exhibits the influence of sitarist Ravi Shankar, particularly in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing. However, the song does not actually feature the sound of the sitar, despite the Byrds having appeared brandishing the instrument at a contemporary press conference held to promote the single. In a 1966 promotional interview, which was added to the expanded CD reissue of the Fifth Dimension album, Crosby said that the song's ending made him \\"feel like a plane landing.\\" An earlier version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded with Al Schmitt at RCA Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but Columbia Records refused to release that recording because it had not been produced at a Columbia-owned studio. McGuinn has since stated that he believes this original version of the song to be more spontaneous sounding than the better known Columbia release. That opinion was echoed by Crosby, who commented, \\"It was a stunner, it was better, it was stronger. It had more flow to it. It was the way we wanted it to be.\\" This original version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" initially saw release on the 1987 archival album Never Before and was also included as a bonus track on the 1996 Columbia/Legacy CD reissue of Fifth Dimension. Answer this question \\"Was there anything unique abou the recording?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, there were several unique aspects about the recording of \\"Eight Miles High.\\" Some of these unique elements include: 1. The influence of John Coltrane's saxophone playing, particularly from his song \\"India,\\" which can be heard in McGuinn's recurring twelve-string guitar solo. 2. The song's exhibit of Ravi Shankar's sitarist influence, especially in the droning quality of the vocal melody and McGuinn's guitar playing. However, the song does not feature the sound of the sitar itself. 3. The band recorded two different versions of the song. The original version, recorded at RCA Studios in Los Angeles, was considered more spontaneous and better by McGuinn and Crosby. However, Columbia Records refused to release it since it was not produced at a Columbia-owned studio, leading to the recording of the better-known version at Columbia Studios in Hollywood."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Panel Says The United Nations said on Thursday that the Islamic State has committed genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq and Syria. GENEVA — Islamic State forces have committed genocide and other war crimes in a continuing effort to exterminate the Yazidi religious minority in Syria and Iraq, United Nations investigators said on Thursday, urging stronger international action to halt the killing and to prosecute the terrorist group. The investigators detailed mass killings of Yazidi men and boys who refused to convert to Islam, saying they were shot in the head or their throats were slit, often in front of their families, littering roadsides with corpses. Dozens of mass graves have been uncovered in areas recaptured from Islamic State and are being investigated. The investigators have produced 11 reports documenting wide-ranging crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by many parties to the five-year-old civil war in Syria, but in a report released on Thursday, they invoked the crime of genocide. They based their findings on actions taken by the Islamic State since August 2014 against 400,000 members of the Yazidi community, followers of a centuries-old religion drawing on many faiths. “Genocide has occurred and is ongoing,” Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, chairman of the panel, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, said in a statement. “ISIS has subjected every Yazidi woman, child or man that it has captured to the most horrific atrocities,” he told reporters in Geneva, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “ISIS permanently sought to erase the Yazidis through killing, sexual slavery, enslavement, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, and forcible transfer causing serious bodily and mental harm.” Those acts, he said, clearly demonstrated its intent to destroy the Yazidi community in whole or in part. More than 3,200 Yazidi women were still being held by Islamic State fighters, mostly in Syria, the panel found. “The crime of genocide must trigger much more assertive action at the political level, including at the Security Council,” Mr. Pinheiro said, calling for the case to be referred to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, or to another international tribunal. “Nothing has been done to save these people, and we hope for stronger action by the international community,” Mr. Pinheiro said, highlighting the obligation for countries under the 1948 genocide convention to take action to prevent it. The report compiled by the panel — based on interviews with survivors, religious leaders, smugglers and medical personnel, among others — had identified individuals responsible for acts of genocide and provided “a road map for prosecution,” said Carla Del Ponte, a Swiss lawyer on the commission and a former prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The commission on Syria has repeatedly recommended referral of the crimes to the International Criminal Court, but no action has followed from the Security Council, where Russia, a permanent member and the closest ally of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, wields a veto. The commission had collected names and details of perpetrators and had shared information with some national authorities, said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a Thai legal scholar on the commission, who called the report “a wonderful gift” to the five permanent members of the Security Council “so that they can consider acting together.” Secretary of State John Kerry said in March that the United States had determined that Islamic State had committed genocide against Yazidis, Christians and Shiite Muslims, but Andrew Clapham, an international law professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, said the rigorous analysis presented by the commission of inquiry would carry more legal weight. The Yazidis came to broad public attention after Islamic State fighters captured Mount Sinjar, in northern Iraq, in 2014 and engaged in systematic slaughter. Kurdish and Yazidi fighters retook Sinjar last fall. Mass killings were only part of the Islamic State’s systematic campaign to eliminate the Yazidi community, the panel found, citing documents that revealed careful planning for treatment of the community after it was overrun and a “massive organizational effort” to coordinate the actions of fighters across Iraq. “ISIS made no secret of its intent to destroy the Yazidis of Sinjar, and that is one of the elements that allowed us to conclude their actions amount to genocide,” Ms. Del Ponte said. In addition to the killings, Islamic State fighters systematically separated Yazidi men and women and carried out rape, sexual mutilation and sterilization to prevent the birth of Yazidi babies, and they transferred captured Yazidi children to the fighters’ families and training camps, cutting them off from Yazidi beliefs and practices and “erasing their identities as Yazidis.” The panel reported in harrowing detail the acute trauma experienced by women and girls as young as 9 who were sold off as spoils of war to become sex slaves of Islamic State fighters, routinely raped and punished with extreme violence if they resisted or tried to escape. Islamic State fighters often targeted younger Yazidi children as a means of punishing their mothers, the report said. It cited an account of a fighter who killed several children after their mother’s effort to escape failed: The mother was then beaten and raped because she cried over their deaths. “No other religious group present in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq has been subjected to the destruction that the Yazidis have suffered,” the report said. Summary:","completion":"The United Nations said that the bad group called ISIS hurt the Yazidi people in Iraq and Syria very badly. These people are not safe right now because of this group. Yazidi men and boys who said no to follow the same religion as ISIS were killed in a very bad way. Many people are trying to stop ISIS and make everything safe again for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Background: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. Paragraph: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force.

Answer the following question: This article: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore.

Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored.

Question: Information: - Dissection (from Latin ' \\"to cut to pieces\\"; also called anatomization), is the dismembering of the body of a deceased animal or plant to study its anatomical structure. Autopsy is used in pathology and forensic medicine to determine the cause of death in humans. It is carried out by or demonstrated to biology and anatomy students in high school and medical school. Less advanced courses typically focus on smaller subjects, such as small formaldehyde-preserved animals, while the more advanced courses normally use cadavers. Consequently, dissection is typically conducted in a morgue or in an anatomy lab. - Deeds of Flesh is a four-piece death metal band from Los Osos, California, U.S. They were formed in 1993 by Jacoby Kingston, Erik Lindmark (Born 1973 ) and Joey Heaslet and are still active. They founded their own label, Unique Leader Records, which has since become home to a number of other death metal bands from around the world. Deeds of Flesh have released eight studio albums, their most recent being \\"Portals to Canaan\\" which was released in 2013. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Path of the Weakening is the third studio release by the American death metal band Deeds of Flesh . It was released in 1999 . - A blast beat is a drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with extreme metal and more recently black metal and thrash. It is utilised by many different styles of metal. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" Blast beats have been described as, \\"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence\\". - Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'path of the weakening' exhibits the relationship of 'record label'. Find the answer from the choices below.

Choices: - multi-propagation - mono-propagation - iso-propagation - self-propagation A: Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's examine each of the provided choices and their relevance to natural methods of asexual reproduction in plants. 1. Multi-propagation: This term is not commonly used or associated with asexual reproduction in plants, so we can eliminate this option. 2. Mono-propagation: This term is also not typically used in relation to plant reproduction, so it is not applicable in this case. 3. Iso-propagation: Yet another term that doesn't have a clear association with asexual reproduction in plants, so we can disregard this option. 4. Self-propagation: This term indicates the ability of an organism to reproduce or propagate without the involvement of another organism. Since natural methods of asexual reproduction, such as cuttings or budding, enable plants to replicate and produce new plants using only their cells and structures, this choice seems to be the most accurate.

Choices: [-] Michael is a Catholic.; [-] Hunter is a Catholic.;","completion":"On a daily basis, Michael always prays, but Hunter sees no need to. Michael is a Catholic, and as such, prayer is an integral aspect of his faith and daily life. Michael might feel that his prayers help him stay connected with God, seek guidance, give thanks, or find solace in times of need. As a devout believer and follower of Catholicism, he prioritizes communication with the divine as an essential part of his religious practice. Consequently, this regular ritual—or discipline—provides him with a sense of meaning, stability, and spiritual growth. In contrast, Hunter is not a Catholic, which explains his lack of interest or necessity in engaging in prayer on a daily basis. He may subscribe to a different belief system, be an atheist or agnostic, or simply have a contrasting perspective when it comes to religion and spirituality. As such, Hunter might not see any practical or emotional benefits from praying daily like Michael does. Instead, Hunter may choose to cope with life's challenges, seek meaning, and achieve personal growth through activities or philosophies that do not involve daily religious rituals. Given their differences in beliefs and approaches to life, it is important for Michael and Hunter to coexist respectfully and empathetically. Mutual understanding, tolerance, and openness to learning from one another can help bridge any gaps. Consequently, as long as they respect one another's perspectives and provide support to each other when needed, their differing religious outlooks need not be a point of contention, but rather an opportunity to grow, learn, and find commonalities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Cambodia (or Kampuchea ), officially known as the Kingdom of Cambodia (Preh Réachéanachâk Kâmpchéa), is a country located in the southern portion of the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. It is in area, bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. - Sourigna Vongsa ( ) was the king of Lan Xang and during his period, it considered the golden age of Laos. He ascended to the throne in 1637. - Stung Treng is the capital of Stung Treng Province, Cambodia. It is located in the western part of the Virachey National Park. It is the major city (and capital) of both the district and province and has a population of 29,665 (2009). In Lao, the city's name is known as \\"Xieng Teng\\". - Attapeu, also written as Attopu or Attapu, is the capital of Attapeu Province, Laos. It is the southernmost among provincial capitals in Laos opposite Phongsali in the north. - The term Champa refers to a collection of independent Cham polities that extended across the coast of what is today central and southern Vietnam from approximately the 2nd century through 19th century (1832), before being absorbed and annexed by the Vietnamese state. The kingdom was known variously as \\"nagara Campa\\" (Sanskrit: ) in the Chamic and Cambodian inscriptions, in Vietnamese (\\"Chiêm Thành\\" in Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary) and (Zhànchéng) in Chinese records. - Kham Nai was king of the southern Laotian Kingdom of Champasak from 1856 - 1858 . - The Kingdom of Champasak (Lao: [càmpàsák]) or Bassac, (17131946) was in 1713 proclaimed a Lao kingdom under Nokasad, a grandson of King Sourigna Vongsa, the last king of Lan Xang; and son-in-law of the Cambodian King Chey Chettha IV.

The object entity 'Kham Nai' was a king of the southern Laotian kingdom of Champasak during 1856 - 1858. Thus his 'country of citizenship' would have been Laos. Although the Kingdom of Champasak had connections to Cambodia through King Nokasad (a son-in-law of the Cambodian King Chey Chettha IV), it was still a Laotian entity. Furthermore, the historical and political context provided does not indicate a change in citizenship for its monarchs, keeping it firmly under the territorial jurisdiction of Laos.

A few days later while Alan is at work, Danny (Duryea) shows up at the Palmers' apartment, tells Jane he is a detective and quickly learns she has begun spending the money. Her husband Alan likewise becomes upset when he finds she has been running up bills, clearly planning to spend the money they had agreed to store and leave untouched. Jane makes a deal with Danny to split the money. Planning to kill him, she drives Danny up into the hills on the pretense they will retrieve the cash where it's been buried.

They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows.

Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", alleging that it derived from their song \\"This Game We Play\\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair. Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven.

The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and it did not share a passage with \\"This Game We Play\\".

So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera.
