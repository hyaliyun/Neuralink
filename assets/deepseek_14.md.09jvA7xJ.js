They're self-centered a**holes, and they missed the big picture. They missed that a 7-year-old kid can see someone close to their age singing a Kings of Leon song, which will maybe make them want to join a glee club or pick up a musical instrument.” “It's like, OK, hate on arts education,” he continued. “You can make fun of Glee all you want, but at its heart, what we really do is turn kids on to music.\\" The band’s frontman, however, is confused by the controversy. “It’s gotten out of hand,” Caleb Followill says. “At the time of the request, we hadn't even seen the show. ...

Introduction \\"Preach what you practice,\\" goes the saying. Nowhere does the concept of demonstrating one's love for an art form by engaging with it through performance, creation, and education sit more strongly than in the field of music. But, as some recent events have shown, this ideal can sometimes fail to cross the boundaries created by commercialism and creative control. The Glee vs Kings of Leon Dispute The American musical dramedy television series Glee, created by Ryan Murphy, has garnered an enormous following since its premiere in 2009. Capturing the hearts of audience members by showcasing the struggles and joys of high school life through song and dance, Glee has introduced many teenagers to the world of music in a fun, engaging, and innovative manner. But not everyone shares Glee creator Ryan Murphy's enthusiasm. One notable disenchantment stems from a recent disagreement with the rock band Kings of Leon, who refused to let their music be used on the show. Murphy shared his reaction with the Hollywood Reporter: \\"F*** you, Kings of Leon. They're self-centered a**holes, and they missed the big picture. They missed that a 7-year-old kid can see someone close to their age singing a Kings of Leon song, which will maybe make them want to join a glee club or pick up a musical instrument.\\" Ryan Murphy's message is clear — by denying Glee the rights to use their music, Kings of Leon may inadvertently turn away potential future fans and hinder the importance of arts education among the younger generations. Murphy continues by saying, \\"It's like, OK, hate on arts education. You can make fun of Glee all you want, but at its heart, what we really do is turn kids on to music.\\" Understanding the Band's Standpoint On the other hand, it's crucial not to overlook the band's perspective. Kings of Leon's frontman, Caleb Followill, is confused by the controversy. \\"It's gotten out of hand,\\" he says. \\"At the time of the request, we hadn't even seen the show. ... This was never meant as a slap in the face to Glee or to music education or to fans of the show. We're not sure where the anger is coming from.\\" While it's important to respect artists' control over their creations, Followill's response highlights the possible disconnect between two essential elements in promoting and celebrating art: creators and educators. The feud between the Glee creator and Kings of Leon inadvertently brings to light the question of responsibility: should musicians facilitate and promote arts education by willingly sharing their work to inspire future generations, or should they retain ultimate control over how their art is used and interpreted? A Missed Opportunity for Arts Education As educational budgets face systematic cuts, and arts courses are often the first on the chopping block, it's apparent that creative education needs all the allies it can muster. Ryan Murphy's Glee has stoked a passion for music in countless young people, and the show's inclination for covering popular hits has the potential to build a devoted audience for these artists. Thus, when artists like Kings of Leon deny the use of their music in this type of influential program, it would be remiss not to consider the potential detrimental impact on art education and future artists. Furthermore, a heated exchange between creators and educators may only serve to muddy the waters, instead of fostering an environment of collaboration and understanding for the betterment of creative learning. Conclusion In conclusion, the Glee vs Kings of Leon conflict shines a spotlight on the delicate balance between artistic control and fruition of arts education. While it is essential to respect and protect artists' rights over their creations, it is equally crucial to acknowledge the importance of inspiring future generations to keep the love for music alive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it. Williamson County population : 226,257 Wayne County population : 16,583 I ran a business with my father, graduated from a high school that was ranked 24/273 instead of one ranked of 223/273 in the state.

Either way, you could cause a terrible accident. In a restaurant There is probably nothing more annoying than a diner receiving or making a call near you when you are in a restaurant. The icy glares you receive should be warning enough that it is not appreciated. Turn you phone off and enough that it is not appreciated. Turn you phone off and use your message service to return calls after you leave. At the cinema Do not give way to the desire to call a friend if the film is boring, or if you want to find out what happens. You could become the target of all the angry cinema customers.

While he did receive the prestigious Reuben Award in 2012, there are other indications that his work was recognized prior to that year. The paragraph highlights that Rick Kirkman received the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Comic Strip Award in 1995 for his work on \\"Baby Blues\\". This clearly indicates that his work was acknowledged and appreciated by the public at least as early as 1995. Additionally, the paragraph states that Kirkman served as co-executive producer of the WB Network TV series of Baby Blues. Although a specific time frame is not provided, we can infer that his involvement in the TV series is another indicator that his work had gained recognition even before 2012, as he was trusted with an important role in bringing the comic strip to a new medium. Furthermore, given that \\"Baby Blues\\" was co-created by Kirkman and has been in syndication since it debuted on January 7, 1990, the comic strip's widespread distribution could also be seen as an indication of its success and recognition by the public. In conclusion, it is incorrect to assume that Rick Kirkman's work was not recognized by the public before 2012.

Relatives of a dying lady I was caring for kicking and screaming not to give their Mum pain relief because they were so terrified / knew it would probably be the thing to end her life. She had a horrible aggressive cancer that ravaged her whole body and needed very regular doses of strong pain relief which - as she had a terminal illness and was receiving end of life care - did not have an upper limit so to speak. She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing. Mum had Alzheimer's and was howling and writhing in agony so we were giving her pain relief but daughters knew it would probably result in her death - which they were right about possibly happening and in their grief and panic, started trying to prevent us from doing anything. Didn’t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn’t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway. One daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom. Her Mum was given the pain relief, immediately relaxed and fell asleep then died peacefully in her sleep about 15 mins later. The saddest thing is her daughter wasn’t able to be there and see her Mum dropping off so peacefully and her last memory will forever be of her screaming and thrashing about as she (daughter) was physically removed from the room. Tragic. Question: Why was Mum in agony === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"The mum was in agony because she had an aggressive cancer that had spread throughout her body. This type of cancer can cause severe pain due to the damage and pressure it puts on nerves, organs, and bones. In addition, the mum also had Alzheimer's disease, which could have exacerbated her distress and discomfort. In this situation, end-of-life care focused on providing pain relief and comfort for the dying patient. The strong pain relief medication might have contributed to her death but was essential to ease her suffering and allow her to pass away peacefully. The daughters, in their grief and fear, struggled to accept the inevitability of their mother's death and tried to prevent the administration of pain relief. However, the medical professionals had a responsibility to prioritize the patient's well-being and provide her with the necessary palliative care to alleviate her suffering. It is understandably difficult for family members to accept the loss of a loved one and the process of providing end-of-life care. In this tragic scenario, the daughters were unable to see their mother pass away peacefully due to their reluctance to allow the necessary medical intervention."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Irish traditionally wear something coloured green on this day as the colour is connected with Ireland. Another St Patrick's Day tradition is for the non-Irish to make jokes about the Irish. Usually these jokes will be about Irish stupidity or their famous thirst for alcohol, or their reputation for telling tall(untrue) stories. These characteristics are all part of the famous Irish stereotype that Irishman are hot-tempered drinkers, who love to fight and will do anything to avoid a day's work. The real joke, however, is that this negative Irish stereotype still exists. The stereotype might have had some truth back in the 19th century when Irish was poverty-stricken and starving. Many Irish moved to the United States to escape famine , but there they had to compete, occasionally with their fists, for jobs and housing with other immigrant groups. It was on America's streets that the Irish earned their reputation for street fighting. However, it was far from truth today, with the exception of the drinking perhaps. Today, the Irish are admired for their story telling gifts and musical talents. It is no accident that several of the greatest writers of the 20th century were Irish. Or that many of today's most popular music groups such as singer Enya and rock band U2, are Irish born and growing. Lonely Planet readers even ranked Ireland as the friendliest country in the world. However, one bit of the Irish stereotype is true, their love for drink. Drinking in Ireland is a job, but it's not necessarily something to criticize. It was the Irish after all who created one of the world's best-loved beers, Guinness. Question: Where did the negative Irish stereotype come from?

The man had more pain when he got a vasectomy than when he got a sunburn because the","completion":"vasectomy was a surgery and sunburn was just from being out in the sun too much. Let me explain this a bit more, little buddy. A vasectomy is a special doctor's visit where the doctor helps a man so he can't make babies anymore. This involves a small surgery, where the doctor has to make a little cut and fix something inside the man's body. Just like when you accidentally hurt yourself and it stings or aches, a surgery sometimes leaves people feeling sore after it's done. That's why the man felt more pain after the vasectomy. On the other hand, a sunburn is what happens when someone spends too much time playing outside on a sunny day without putting on enough sunscreen or taking breaks in the shade. The sun's rays gently cook their skin, leaving it red, warm, and a bit painful. Imagine you accidentally touched a warm cookie tray, and your finger felt hot and sensitive for a little while. That's like a sunburn, but all over your body! Since the vasectomy was a surgery and involved a doctor fixing something inside the man's body, it made him feel more pain than the sunburn, which happened to the outside of his body and wasn't as serious.

Question: What killed Lars' dog? Movie title: The Thing Movie plot: In the opening shot, an alien spaceship flies through space and enters Earth's atmosphere near Antarctica. Whether or not the ship crashes or lands on Earth is unknown.In Antarctica, the winter months of 1982, a helicopter flies hurriedly after a husky. The man riding next to the pilot shoots a rifle and drops grenades hoping to kill the dog. The runs toward an American research base, Outpost 31, where a 12-man research crew is getting ready for the upcoming winter. The helicopter, which they see is from a Norwegian research base, flies in and lands. The Americans watch puzzled as two men that emerge from the helicopter speak frantically in their native language. One of them pulls the pin on a grenade but clumsily throws it behind him. As he frantically tries to find it in the snow, it explodes, killing him and taking the helicopter with it. The pilot (named Matias in the prequel) is shooting his rifle hysterically and talking frantically; no one can understand what he is saying and the man shoots Bennings (Peter Maloney) in his left leg. The camp leader Garry (Donald Moffat) shoots and kills the gibbering man in defense.Puzzled about why the Norwegians were trying to kill the dog, MacReady (Kurt Russell) the team's helicopter pilot, their doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart) and Norris (Charles Hallahan), go to investigate the Norwegian base. Everyone is dead; one of them had barricaded himself in the radio room and is still sitting frozen in his chair, his wrists and throat slit in an apparent suicide. Mac and Copper explore further, finding a large and empty block of ice. Outside in the snow, along with one or two burned human bodies, Mac and Copper find the burnt and frozen corpse of a twisted creature, not man but not beast, either.

The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points.

Answer the following question: Jordan started to feel better after taking some medication for their headache. Given the question \\"How would you describe Jordan?\\", is \\"felt very relieved\\" a valid answer? Available choices: (A). Yes; (B). No; Answer:","completion":"Answer: (A). Yes Explanation: The question on how to describe Jordan focuses on their emotional state or conditions in relation to a particular situation. In this scenario, Jordan started to feel better after taking medication for their headache. Therefore, it is reasonable to describe Jordan as \\"felt very relieved\\" because experiencing relief is a natural reaction to an improvement in physical discomfort or pain. When people experience headaches, they usually find it difficult to concentrate on their tasks, communicate effectively with others, and can also experience irritability. The intensity of headaches can vary; some might be mild or moderate, while others might be so severe that they debilitate the person experiencing them. In Jordan's case, taking medication to alleviate the headache brought relief, indicating that their comfort and well-being were positively impacted by the medication. In answering the question \\"How would you describe Jordan?\\" by saying they \\"felt very relieved,\\" you are highlighting an emotional response resulting from the alleviation of their headache. It reflects a human experience of feeling grateful, satisfied, or more at ease with their physical state after addressing an issue that was causing discomfort. This description captures an aspect of Jordan's emotional condition after taking the medication and offers insight into their experience in the given situation. In conclusion, stating that Jordan \\"felt very relieved\\" is a valid answer when describing them, as it emphasizes their emotional response to an improvement in their physical well-being. It allows the person inquiring to understand how Jordan's condition changed after taking the medication and how that change made an impact on their feelings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Argentine forces, who had landed on the Falklands to stake a territorial claim, were ejected by a British military task force. Argentina says it has a right to the islands, which it calls the Malvinas, because it inherited them from the Spanish crown in the early 1800s. It has also based its claim on the islands' proximity to the South American mainland. Britain rests its case on its long-term administration of the Falklands and on the principle of self-determination for the islanders, who are almost all of British descent. The windswept and almost-treeless territory is made up of two main islands, East Falkland and West Falkland, as well as hundreds of smaller islands and islets.

Argentina continually protests against British occupation. 1965 - UN resolution invites Britain and Argentina to discuss ways of finding a peaceful solution to their dispute. 1982 - Argentina invades, prompting Falklands War. 1990 - Argentina and Britain restore diplomatic relations, severed in 1982. 2013 - Islanders vote to remain a British overseas territory.

It had a population of 29,616 in 2001, increasing to 39,201 at the 2011 Census. The settlement is of Saxon origin. Hatfield House, the home of the Marquess of Salisbury, is the nucleus of the old town. From the 1930s when de Havilland opened a factory until the 1990s when British Aerospace closed, Hatfield was associated with aircraft design and manufacture, which employed more people than any other industry. Hatfield was one of the post-war New Towns built around London and has much modernist architecture from the period. The University of Hertfordshire is based there. Hatfield is north of London and is connected to the capital via the A1(M) and direct trains to London King's Cross, Finsbury Park and Moorgate. As a result, the town has seen a recent increase in commuters who work in London moving to the area. In the Saxon period Hatfield was known as Hetfelle, but by the year 970, when King Edgar gave to the monastery of Ely, it had become known as Haethfeld. Hatfield is mentioned in the Domesday Book as the property of the Abbey of Ely, and unusually, the original census data which compilers of Domesday used still survives, giving us slightly more information than in the final Domesday record. No other records remain until 1226, when Henry III granted the Bishops of Ely rights to an annual four-day fair and a weekly market. The town was then called Bishop's Hatfield. 1. what is Hatfield? 2. where at? 3. within what? 4. what is the majority origin? 5. what is the most recent population? 6. when was it? 7. what was it 10 years prior 8.

Avoid letting your dog get familiar with toileting indoors if you'd like it to toilet outside. If you have a place in your yard where you'd like your dog to toilet, bring it to the spot immediately. Before you even go into your house, let it sniff around the yard until your dog urinates or defecates. When your dog does urinate or defecate, give your dog lots of verbal praise and attention so your dog associates going to the bathroom outside with being praised. In order to make your French bulldog a good household member, begin potty training your dog as soon as you get it. If you wait to begin training and let your dog toilet on puppy pads, it will take longer to potty train it and you dog will be confused about where to toilet. You'll need to be very consistent and encouraging when you begin housebreaking your French bulldog. Most dogs will show signs that they need to toilet, so watch your French bulldog to become familiar with your dog's specific signs. You should also be in the habit of frequently giving it the opportunity to toilet. Signs that your dog needs to toilet include: Panting Pacing or sniffing around the house Barking Wandering off to a quiet area If you didn't notice your dog's cue to toilet or your dog accidentally goes in the house, thoroughly clean up the mess. You'll need to use a product designed for pet messes or a special pet-urine enzymatic cleaner. This will completely remove the scent of urine so your dog doesn't return to the same spot to toilet later. Don't scold or hit your dog for having an accident. Your dog won't be able to associate the punishment with the action (toileting inside) and your dog will learn not to trust you.","completion":"To effectively potty train a French bulldog, be consistent and encouraging, beginning training early, using praise for outdoor toileting, and recognizing the dog's specific signs for needing to toilet while avoiding indoor toileting confusion and not punishing accidents."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who is one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists? , can you please find it? Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \\"Our Song\\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \\"Love Story\\" and \\"You Belong with Me\\", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner. Swift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \\"Mean\\" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? In our Hello World program, we printed out a string for the user to see, but the interactive part of programs is when the user gets to enter input into the program. We will now extend our program to prompt the user for his or her name and then greet the user by his or her name. In Java, we have some built in libraries that we have access to, but we have to import them. One of these libraries is java.util, which contains the Scanner object that we need to get user input. In order to import the Scanner class, we add the following line to the beginning of our code. import java.util.Scanner; This tells our program that we want to use the Scanner object which exists in the package java.util. If we wanted to have access to every object in the java.util package, we simply write import java.util.*; at the beginning of our code. Java is an object-oriented programming language, so it represents concepts using objects. The Scanner object is an example of an object that has fields and methods. In order to use the Scanner class, we have to create a new Scanner object that we can populate the fields of and use the methods of. To do this, we write: Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in); userInputScanner is the name of the Scanner object that we just instantiated. Note that the name is written in camel case; this is the convention for naming variables in Java. We use the new operator to create a new instance of an object. So, in this instance, we created a new instance of the Scanner object by writing new Scanner(System.in). The Scanner object takes in a parameter that tells the object what to scan. In this case, we put in System.in as a parameter. System.in tells the program to scan the input from the system, which is the input that the user will type into the program. We have to prompt the user for an input so that the user knows when to type something into the console. This can be accomplished with a System.out.print or a System.out.println. System.out.print(\\"What's your name? \\"); The Scanner will always be taking in data on what the user is typing in. The following line will ask the Scanner to take what the user has typed in for his or her name and store it in a variable: String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine(); In Java, the convention for using an object's method is objectName.methodName(parameters). In userInputScanner.nextLine(), we are calling our Scanner object by the name we just gave it and then we are calling its method nextLine() which does not take in any parameters. Note that we are storing the next line in another object: the String object. We have named our String object userInputName Now that we have the user's name stored, we can print out a greeting to the user. Remember the System.out.println(\\"Hello World.\\"); that we wrote in the main class? All of the code that we just wrote should go above that line. Now we can modify that line to say: System.out.println(\\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\"); The way we chained up \\"Hello \\", the user's name, and \\"!\\" by writing \\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\" is called String concatenation. What's happening here is that we have three strings: \\"Hello \\", userInputName, and \\"!\\". Strings in Java are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed. So when we are concatenating these three strings, we are essentially created a new string that contains the greeting. Then we take this new string and feed it as a parameter to System.out.println. Our code should now look like this: import java.util.Scanner; public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(\\"What's your name? \\"); String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine(); System.out.println(\\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\"); } } Go into command prompt or terminal and run the same commands as we ran for our first iteration of HelloWorld.java. We have to first compile the program: javac HelloWorld.java. Then we can run it: java HelloWorld.","completion":"This article teaches how to create a Java program that asks for a user's name and then greets them using the Scanner object from the java.util library, with step-by-step instructions and explanations on how the code works."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The two groups have clashed several times in the last few years. The Batwa killed several members of the Luba ethnic group near the region of Kabalo in Katanga. The Luba then launched a revenge attack, killing at least 13 pygmies. Tensions between the hunter-gatherer pygmies and the Luba, a Bantu ethnic group, have caused hundreds of deaths over the past three years. Caterpillars are a delicacy in western DR Congo, in the area around the capital Kinshasa, hundreds of miles from Katanga where the deadly clashes occurred. They are harvested from trees, smoked and often eaten with sauce. However they are an unexpected cause of conflict in DR Congo, particularly in Katanga. That province is not known for its love of eating caterpillars and people have certainly never killed for them before. But there is a running feud in the area between pygmies and other ethnic groups.

After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc.

In general, a runway of this length would be sufficient to support large commercial aircraft and potentially heavy cargo planes. The length of the runway thus gives us some insight into the size and potential capacity of the Angola International Airport. 5. Role in local and international transportation: Given its name as Angola International Airport, one can infer that the airport handles both domestic and international flights. This assumption underscores the airport's role in connecting not only Luanda but also the broader country of Angola to global air travel destinations. In summary, the sentence offers a brief overview of Angola International Airport, touching upon its name, location served, runway presence and length, as well as its implied role in facilitating both local and international flights. This data provides a general insight into the airport's function, capacity, and importance within Angola's transportation infrastructure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional 100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the 50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war. For decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property. Last month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on 50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied. China gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal. Beijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles. In other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between 225 billion and 600 billion every year. That rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \\"We can't afford to give up our technology,\\" Kudlow said Friday. \\"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\\" The Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently...

Question: You are given a new situation: Over the years, the town of Euphoria has grown more successful and wealthier than anyone ever thought. As the wealth has increased and people have acquired more material possessions, their outlook on life has become more positive and it has been noted that the citizens have a lower incidence of depression. The town of Zenphora, on the other hand, has taken a downward financial turn over the past 50 years. The citizens have had to sell their worldly goods just to make ends meet and many do not have a good feeling about what their future holds. and a hint : Using longitudinal data from over 100 countries, Diener and his colleagues showed that rich countries are in general happier than poor countries (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013).[17] Also, life satisfaction for most countries goes up as they become wealthier over time. Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity. Please answer this question : Which town is more optimistic, Euphoria or Zenphora? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given situation and the research mentioned, it can be concluded that the town of Euphoria is more optimistic compared to Zenphora. There are several reasons that support this conclusion. Firstly, Euphoria has experienced a significant increase in overall wealth and success, leading to a higher quality of life for its citizens. This growth in material wealth has resulted in a more positive outlook among the population, which correlates with the findings of Diener, Tay, and Oishi (2013)[17]. According to their study, people from richer countries exhibit higher levels of happiness compared to those from poorer countries. Therefore, the residents of Euphoria are more likely to have a higher subjective well-being (SWB), which can contribute to their optimism. Secondly, as the town's wealth has increased, its citizens have acquired more material possessions, leading to greater household material prosperity. This factor, as identified by Diener, is directly linked to the relationship between income and SWB. The high material prosperity of Euphoria's citizens would also contribute to their higher levels of optimism. Furthermore, the lower incidence of depression reported among Euphoria's citizens implies a healthier mental state for the overall population. This mental well-being is likely to have a positive impact on the town's overall outlook and optimism. On the other hand, Zenphora has experienced a downward financial turn over the years, leading to its citizens selling their worldly goods just to make ends meet. This decline in economic conditions and material wealth lowers the financial satisfaction of Zenphora's residents, another factor influencing SWB as identified by Diener. The uncertainty about the future felt by Zenphora's citizens further contributes to the lesser optimism in their town. This lack of security and confidence in the future can impact the residents' mental well-being, making them less hopeful and optimistic compared to the citizens of Euphoria. In conclusion, based on the research conducted by Diener and his colleagues, as well as the context provided, the town of Euphoria is more optimistic than Zenphora due to the substantial difference in their economic conditions, material wealth, financial satisfaction, and overall mental well-being of their populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In dieser Übersetzung geht es um den Prozess der Verdauung, bei dem Nahrung in ihre Bestandteile zerlegt wird, um eine effektive Aufnahme dieser durch den Körper zu gewährleisten. Dieser Prozess ist wichtig, da die zugeführte Nahrung in einer Form vorliegt, die vom Körper nicht direkt aufgenommen werden kann. Aus diesem Grund muss die Nahrung zunächst in ihre Bestandteile aufgespalten werden, damit diese vom Darmwand absorbierbar sind. Die Zerlegung der Nahrung beginnt bereits im Mund, wo Speichel und Zähne durch Kauen die Nahrung zerkleinern und mit Verdauungsenzymen vermengen. Anschließend gelangt die zerkleinerte Nahrung in den Magen, der weitere Enzyme und Magensäure zur Verfügung stellt, um die Nahrung aufzuspalten. Im Laufe dieses Prozesses werden die komplexen Makromoleküle der Nahrung in kleinere Bestandteile, wie Aminosäuren, Monosaccharide und Fettsäuren, aufgebrochen. Nach der Aufspaltung der Nahrung durch Magen und Dünndarm erreichen die zerkleinerten Nährstoffe den Dünndarm, der für die Aufnahme der meisten Nährstoffe verantwortlich ist. Dort verbinden sich die Nährstoffe mit Transportproteinen und werden durch die Dünndarmwand in den Blutkreislauf oder das Lymphsystem aufgenommen. Durch die Absorption der Bestandteile im Darm ist es dem Körper möglich, diese zur Energiegewinnung, Zellreparatur und -aufbau, oder für andere lebenswichtige Prozesse zu verwenden. Der Dünndarm ist mit zahlreichen Fingerfortsätzen, sogenannten Villi und Mikrovilli, ausgestattet, die die Oberfläche der Dünndarmwand erhöhen und dadurch eine effizientere Aufnahme der Nahrungsbestandteile ermöglichen. Nachdem die Nährstoffe in den Blutkreislauf und das Lymphsystem aufgenommen wurden, gelangen sie in die verschiedenen Organe und Zellen des Körpers, um dort ihre jeweilige Funktion zu erfüllen. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass der Abbau von Nahrung in ihre Bestandteile notwendig ist, damit der Körper diese durch den Darm aufnehmen kann. Dieser Prozess ermöglicht es dem Körper, die zugeführte Nahrung effektiv und gezielt zu verwerten und für verschiedene lebenswichtige Funktionen zu nutzen."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Abbey Road is the eleventh album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 26 September 1969 by Apple Records. The recording sessions for the album were the last in which all four Beatles participated. Although Let It Be was the final album that the Beatles completed before the band's dissolution in April 1970, most of the album had been recorded before the Abbey Road sessions began. A double A-side single from the album, \\"Something\\"/\\"Come The front cover design, a photograph of the group on a zebra crossing, was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst he stood on a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which of the shots would be used upon the album sleeve. In the image selected by McCartney, the group walk across the street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and out of step with the other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for PS2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911 - 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney. Shortly after the album's release the cover became part of the \\"Paul is dead\\" rumour that was spreading across college campuses in the United States. According to followers of the rumour, the cover depicted the Beatles walking out of a cemetery in a funeral procession. The procession was led by Lennon, dressed in white, as a religious figure, Starr, dressed in black, as the undertaker, McCartney, out of step with the others, as a barefoot corpse and Harrison, dressed in denim, as the gravedigger. The left-handed McCartney is holding a cigarette in his right hand, said to indicate an imposter and the license plate on the Volkswagen parked on the street is 28IF, meaning McCartney would have been 28 if he had lived. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Why was that rumor spreading","completion":"There was a rumor spreading that Paul McCartney from the Beatles had passed away because of the way the Abbey Road album cover looked. In the picture, the Beatles were walking like they were in a funeral procession. People thought that John was a religious figure, Ringo was an undertaker, Paul was a barefoot corpse (also holding a cigarette with the wrong hand), and George was a gravedigger. So, some people believed that the cover was secretly telling everyone that Paul was no longer alive. But it was just a rumor, and not true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: A Streetcar Named Desire Movie plot: Under mysterious circumstances, Blanche DuBois, an aging high school teacher, leaves her home in Auriol, Mississippi to travel to New Orleans to live with her sister, Stella Kowalski. She arrives on the train and boards a streetcar named \\"Desire\\" and reaches her sister's home in the French Quarter where she discovers that her sister and brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski, live in a cramped and dilapidated two-room apartment in an old New Orleans tenement. Blanche and Stella are all that remain of an old aristocratic family. Blanche discloses that the family estate, Belle Reve, has been lost to creditors, and that she wants to stay with Stella and Stanley for a while. Blanche seems lost and broke, with nowhere to go. Stella welcomes her with an open heart. From the start, Blanche and Stanley are wary of each other. Blanche has a soft-spoken manner; Stanley is rough and loud. His mere presence seems to threaten her, while her behavior and manner arouse suspicion in him. She is especially adroit at patronizing and criticizing Stella from the start. When interrogated about her past, struggling to be polite, Blanche says that she was married and widowed at a young age. She says that she has taken a leave of absence from her job due to her nerves. To satisfy Stanley's skepticism about the loss of the estate, Blanche hands over her papers pertaining to Belle Reve. But Stanley grabs at some of her private papers that she is holding back, and they cascade to the floor. Weeping, she gathers them all back, saying that they are poems from her dead husband. He defends himself by saying that he was just looking out for his family, and then announces that Stella is going to have a baby. Soon after her arrival, Stanley has a poker night with his friends where Blanche meets Mitch. His courteous manner sets him apart from Stanley's other friends. They like each other right away. This is the start of their romance. Stanley explodes in a drunken rage, striking Stella, and sending his friends running, while Blanche and Stella flee... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Stella goes to the hospital primarily because she is giving birth to her baby. In the movie \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" Stella Kowalski becomes pregnant during the course of the story. The plot revolves around the tense relationship between Stella's sister, Blanche DuBois, and her husband, Stanley Kowalski. As their conflicting personalities and backgrounds create drama, tension rises in the household. While the primary reason for Stella's hospital visit is childbirth, it is also important to note that the escalating tension between Blanche and Stanley could have had an impact on Stella's well-being. The stress caused by her sister's arrival and the constant bickering with Stanley may have contributed to Stella feeling overwhelmed and possibly experiencing some pregnancy complications that would require medical attention. As Stella goes to the hospital, this event marks a significant turning point in the movie, as it leaves Blanche and Stanley alone in the apartment. This unfortunate circumstance sets the stage for further unsettling events and ultimately culminates in a dramatic showdown between the two characters. In conclusion, Stella goes to the hospital to give birth to her baby, and this event, coupled with the existing tension between Blanche and Stanley, plays a crucial role in the development of the movie's plot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They both polluted the environment in different ways. and a hint : In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. Please answer this question : Which county contributed less to acid rain formation? Answer:","completion":"Plant county contributed less to acid rain formation than Thorn county. The primary reason behind this difference lies in the source of energy each county utilized for their energy needs. Thorn county relied on fossil fuels, while Plant county used nuclear power. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, produce a significant amount of harmful emissions when burned for electricity generation. These emissions include sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, which are major contributors to the formation of acid rain. Acid rain is formed when these pollutants react with water vapor in the atmosphere, creating acidic compounds that fall to the ground as rain, snow, or mist. Acid rain has detrimental effects on ecosystems, including soil and water degradation, damage to aquatic life, and harm to both crops and vegetation. In contrast, nuclear power generation does not produce the same level of emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Nuclear reactors produce electricity through nuclear fission, a process in which energy is generated by splitting the nuclei of heavy atoms, such as uranium or plutonium. This process does not emit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or particulate matter, making it a significantly cleaner source of electricity in terms of air pollution and contribution to acid rain formation. While it is true that nuclear energy has its own set of environmental concerns, such as the handling and disposal of radioactive waste, these issues primarily pertain to the risk of radioactive contamination rather than contributing to acid rain formation and air pollution. Furthermore, although radioactive elements are also nonrenewable resources, the time scale of their depletion is much longer than that of fossil fuels, which are being consumed at an exponential rate. Based on the provided information, Plant county's reliance on nuclear power for their energy needs resulted in a smaller contribution to the formation of acid rain compared to Thorn county, which used fossil fuels as their primary energy source. This difference illustrates the importance of considering alternative energy sources and implementing cleaner energy production methods to mitigate the environmental impacts associated with electricity generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Paragraph: Two groups of teens studied fire for the physics class.

What is the answer: What religious group places a great importance on wearing the turban?","completion":"The religious group that places great importance on wearing the turban is the Sikhs, followers of Sikhism. Sikhism is a monotheistic religion founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. Today, Sikhism is the fifth largest religion globally, with over 25 million followers worldwide. The turban, known as \\"Dastaar\\" or \\"Pagri\\" in Punjabi, holds significant spiritual, historical, and cultural importance for Sikhs. One of the reasons why turban wearing is considered crucial in Sikhism is the concept of maintaining uncut hair, known as \\"Kesh,\\" which is one of the Five Ks (\\"Panj Kakaar\\"). The Five Ks are essential articles of faith that all baptized Sikhs, also known as Khalsa, are instructed to wear by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. Aside from Kesh, the other four Ks include Kara (steel bracelet), Kanga (small wooden comb), Kachera (cotton undergarments), and Kirpan (ceremonial sword). The turban serves multiple purposes, as it helps protect and manage the uncut hair while ensuring cleanliness and promoting a unique identity. It is important to note that both Sikh men and women may wear turbans, although it is more common among men than women. Historically, the turban played a vital role in asserting social and political equality during the time of Mughal rule in India. At that time, wearing a turban was a privilege reserved for the high-ranking officials and elites. By encouraging his followers to wear turbans, Guru Nanak aimed to break down social barriers, emphasizing that all are equal in the eyes of God. Furthermore, the turban has cultural significance for Sikhs, as it symbolizes self-respect, honor, and spirituality. It acts as a constant reminder of the wearer's commitment to the teachings of Sikhism and their dedication to upholding its tenets. Wearing the turban also instills a sense of unity among Sikhs, creating an easily recognizable identity that fosters social cohesion and camaraderie.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who observes the girl running from the taxi driver? Just-married taxi driver Thomas Leslie 'Tom' Manning is led to an abandoned bomb-site by an eight-year-old girl who says that she has lost her dog. The kind-hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief to dry her tears. She then runs off taunting Manning as an April-fool prank. He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz. A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case. She later wins the sympathy of the junior counsel Peter Tanner, who visits Manning in prison, believes in his protestation of innocence and makes the case his own. The trial begins at London's Old Bailey, where Tanner is opposed by his father, prosecuting counsel Geoffrey Tanner. The trial is presided over by Justice Harrington, whose wife is in the hospital undergoing a serious operation. It soon becomes evident that things are going badly for Manning. Jurors are seen expressing their belief in Manning's guilt even before the trial was over. Irene's mother gave hearsay evidence that Manning had given the victim sweets, breaking down in tears and accusing Manning of murder. Following the testimony of prosecution-witness Horace Clifford, all of the evidence seems to point to Manning's guilt. Answer:","completion":"The girl running from the taxi driver, Thomas Leslie 'Tom' Manning, is observed by Mrs Zunz."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been...

According to John Ford's lyrically shot, fictional biopic of Abraham Lincoln's life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in \\"the worst way.\\" Ford's camera has only praising views to reveal of Mr. Lincoln's early life. But for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision. Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film, what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames, Ford has a unique eye for telling a story. The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln to a tee, one of his best roles. The film concerns two young men, brothers, on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed. In classic angry mob style, the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them, until honest Abe steps into the fray. He charms them with his humor, telling them not to rob him of his first big case, and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer. What follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom- murder-dramas thereafter, as Abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge, jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links. The film plays out like many John Ford movies do: a tablespoon of Americana, a dash of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm that you aren't sure if you put in the recipe or if Ford did it himself. Despite the overtly 'Hollywood' feel of the film, and overly patriotic banter alluding to Lincoln's future presidency, the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed, if you can take your drama with a grain of salt.

The Dano-Hanseatic War from 1426-1435 was an armed trade conflict between the Danish dominated Kalmar Union and the German Hanseatic League led by the Free City of Lübeck. When Danish king Eric opened the Baltic trade routes for Dutch ships and introduced a new toll for all foreign ships passing the Øresund , six Hanseatic cities declared war, put a naval blockade on Scandinavian harbours and allied with Eric's enemy Henry IV, count of Holstein. Therefore the war was intensively linked with the Dutch-Hanseatic War , the Kalmar War with Holstein and the Swedish revolt . After years of changing fortune in warfare Rostock and Stralsund signed a separate peace agreement in 1430. Lübeck, Hamburg, Wismar and Lüneburg, however, continued the war and assisted Holstein to conquer Flensburg in 1431. Thereafter they agreed an armistice in 1432 and started peace negotiations. Meanwhile an anti-Danish revolt broke out in Sweden . In 1434 Eric had to agree an armistice with the Swedes, too. In April 1435 he signed the peace of Vordingborg with the Hanseatic League and Holstein, followed by the peace of Stockholm with Sweden a few months later the same year. The Hanseatic cities were excepted from the Sound Dues but they had to accept Dutch competition in the Baltic trade. The Danish Duchy of Schleswig was ceded to the count of Holstein. Sweden's autonomous rights and privileges were extended. These peace agreements weakened Eric's position dramatically, and in 1439 he got dethroned by Danish, Swedish and Norwegian Privy Councils.

Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent.

Its scientific results covered extensive ground in biology, zoology, geology, meteorology and magnetism. The expedition discovered the existence of the only snow-free Antarctic valleys, which contain Antarctica's longest river. Further achievements included the discoveries of the Cape Crozier emperor penguin colony, King Edward VII Land, and the Polar Plateau (via the western mountains route) on which the South Pole is located.

So, let's move the 33 to the other side of the equal sign. To do that, we can subtract 33 from both sides: 0 - 33 = -33 * s -33 = -33 * s Now, we want to find out how many times the -33 goes into -33 to get s.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"\\"In a startup corporation, is there any reason NOT to issue all authorized (but undistributed) shares as 'treasury stock'?\\" Imagine you have a toy store and you make some toy shares as a way to share the ownership of the store with your friends. Now, instead of giving all the toy shares to your friends right away, you keep some in a special box called 'treasury stock.' There could be some reasons not to issue all the shares as treasury stock right away. One reason is that you might want to invite more friends to own part of the store later, so you keep some toy shares in the box for them. Another reason is that you might want to sell more shares to your friends later, to get more candy (money) to buy more toys for the store. \\"Why was the majority of Bose Corporation's stock given to MIT?\\" Bose Corporation is like a big toy store that makes super cool and high-quality speakers (toys that make sound). The man who started the company, Amar Bose, was a really smart guy and he liked a special school called MIT, where he learned a lot of cool things. Amar Bose decided to give most of his own toy shares of the company to MIT because he was thankful for all the things he had learned there. This special gift helps MIT to keep teaching other smart people to create cool and helpful inventions in the future. \\"Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?\\" No, these questions are not paraphrases of each other. Paraphrase means that two sentences say the same thing but use different words. These questions are different because one is asking about a specific way of sharing ownership in a startup corporation (a new toy store), while the other is asking about a special gift Amar Bose gave to MIT."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (OPTIONS: -negative. -positive.).","completion":"Title: A Tremendous Misfire - A Dissection of 'Disappointment Express' Over the years, we have eagerly anticipated many cinematic masterpieces, only to have our high hopes shattered by mediocre storytelling and sloppy filmmaking. The latest victim of this epidemic was none other than the much-hyped film, Disappointment Express. With an all-star cast, an experienced director at the helm, and a concept that seemingly promised an intriguing story, it's disheartening to witness the rise and fall of what could have been a marvelous cinematic gem. To begin, the script was a convoluted mess. The story was teeming with confusing subplots, redundant twists and turns, and an overall lack of coherence. While attempting to craft an intricate narrative, the writers inadvertently created an unfathomable knot of tangled storylines, with characters disappearing only to return later with no explanation or relevance to the story. For a protagonist-driven plot, Disappointment Express lost all semblances of stability and reason to invest in the lead character's journey. Moreover, the extensive run time of nearly three hours did no favors for the film. As if the torturous tale wasn't enough, the dragging pace had audiences checking their watches and daydreaming about what could have been an engaging story. The unnecessarily prolonged scenes and redundant dialogue managed only to bore the viewer further into a downward spiral of disappointment. The all-star cast was perhaps the film's biggest betrayal. With a talented lineup comprising A-list actors and fan-favorite performers, one would expect electrifying chemistry and memorable performances. Instead, the stellar group of actors appeared to be stranded in a sea of mediocrity, offering inconsistent and painfully unconvincing portrayals of their characters. The film failed to capitalize on the massive talent pool at its disposal, leaving us with underdeveloped and bland characters who were far from memorable. The director, who has previously showcased his mastery over the art of cinema, seemed to have massively misfired with Disappointment Express. His negligence in handling the story, characters, and pacing clearly manifested throughout the entire film. It was hard to believe that the mind behind some of the industry's most captivating films had produced this barely watchable feature. If there was any redeeming factor in this train wreck, perhaps it was the breathtaking visuals and cinematography. The stunning landscape shots and meticulously crafted set pieces were, unfortunately, the only saving grace amid this cinematic disaster. However, even these qualities could not salvage the unsalvageable, ultimately failing to breathe life into a floundering endeavor. In conclusion, Disappointment Express was a glaring example of wasted potential with a disjointed script, bland characters, and seasoned professionals who failed to leave a lasting impression. It's a shame that such a promising premise succumbed to poor storytelling and direction. Thus, the ultimate legacy of Disappointment Express will be yet another lesson in the art of squandered opportunities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

This person is 23 years old but is often mistaken for someone much younger, such as a 12-year-old or 18-year-old. As a result, when they consume alcohol, particularly in social situations like their mom's work party, the people around them may feel concerned or worried about their actions. After taking a beer to drink, the following may happen: 1. Disapproving or concerned looks: The people around the person might give them worried or disapproving looks, thinking they are underage and should not be consuming alcohol. This reaction could be based on their mistaken belief that the person is a minor. 2. People might question their age: In some situations, people might confront the person and ask for their age to ensure they are legally allowed to drink alcohol. These questions could make the person feel uncomfortable and singled out. 3. People may feel uneasy or uncomfortable: Some people at the event might feel uneasy or awkward about the perceived underage person consuming alcohol. This could cause unnecessary tension in the social gathering. 4. The person may be asked to show ID: In some cases, the person might be asked to present identification to prove their age. This can be an embarrassing and frustrating experience, as it reinforces the misperception that the person is not of legal drinking age. 5. Social isolation: The person might feel socially isolated due to the reactions of others around them, as they are treated differently due to their youthful appearance. This could lead to a sense of loneliness or frustration as a result of the misunderstandings about their age. 6. Loss of self-esteem: Continuously being mistaken for someone younger than they are can negatively impact the person's self-esteem, making them doubt themselves and feel disrespected or undervalued. In conclusion, when a person who appears younger than their actual age takes a beer to drink, they may experience worried looks, questioning, unease, and possibly even be asked to show ID. This can lead to feelings of social isolation and a loss of self-esteem as they struggle with being misjudged based on their appearance. The person should consider openly expressing their age or finding ways to appear more mature to reduce the likelihood of these situations occurring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an Aboriginal elder, \\"King George\\".

The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah, who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah tells her that he has seen her cattle being driven onto Carney's land â in other words, stolen from her. Because of this Fletcher mistreats Nullah and threatens him and his mother, so Lady Sarah fires Fletcher and decides to try to run the cattle station herself. When Nullah and his mother hide from the authorities in a water tower, his mother drowns. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song \\"Over the Rainbow\\" from the film The Wizard of Oz.

The U.S. State Department on Friday ramped up its warnings urging Americans not to join other activists in a flotilla, expected to sail soon, aimed at challenging Israel's maritime blockage of the Gaza strip. According to organizers, the flotilla is meant to commemorate the one-year anniversary of a similar flotilla that resulted in a clash in international waters with Israeli navy commandos that left nine people -- including an American citizen -- dead. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters Friday that she didn't think the plan \\"is useful or productive or helpful to the people of Gaza.\\" \\"We have certainly encouraged that American citizens not participate in the flotilla,\\" she said, \\"and we are urging that all precautions be taken to avoid any kind of confrontation.\\" Clinton's comments followed an even harsher statement by State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland, in which she criticized what she called \\"irresponsible and provocative actions that risk the safety of their passengers.\\" Last May, the Mavi Marmara -- owned by the Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH -- and five other ships were on their way to Gaza, carrying humanitarian aid and about 700 activists from various countries, when Israeli soldiers swarmed aboard it. Despite international condemnation, an independent Israeli commission, led by retired judge Yaakov Turkel, later found that Israeli commandos \\"acted professionally and in a measured manner in the face of unanticipated violence\\" when they seized the Gaza-bound aid ship. In September, the U.N. Human Rights Council found Israeli forces \\"committed serious violations of international law\\" in the raid and suggested that six of the civilian deaths were \\"consistent with ... an arbitrary and summary execution.\\" Israel called the report \\"as biased and as one-sided as the body that has produced it.\\" The U.S. State Department earlier this week issued a travel warning advisting U.S. citizens \\"against traveling to Gaza by any means, including via sea.\\" \\"Previous attempts to enter Gaza by sea have been stopped by Israeli naval vessels and resulted in the injury, death, arrest, and deportation of U.S. citizens,\\" the State Department statement said. \\"U.S. citizens participating in any effort to reach Gaza by sea should understand that they may face arrest, prosecution, and deportation by the government of Israel.\\" Ali Abunimah, a blogger for the Electronic Intifada and supporter of the protest, accused Clinton of seeming to \\"lay the ground -- indeed almost provide a green light -- for an Israeli military attack on the upcoming Gaza Freedom Flotilla.\\" Activists say the blockade is illegal and has worked to undermine Gaza's already fledgling economy. Israel has promised to block any attempt to break a blockade that they say is important in keeping weapons from being delivered to Gaza. The protesters said they raised funds to purchase a U.S.-flagged vessel, which they named \\"The Audacity of Hope,\\" a reference to the best-selling book of the same title by President Barack Obama. The boat, they claim, will carry 36 passengers, four crew members, and ten journalists. The protesters say they want to \\"challenge U.S. foreign policy\\" by providing aid and supplies directly to the citizens of Gaza, in spite of Israel's blockade. \\"We encourage all Americans to support our voyage, and to agitate with the US government and public opinion to ensure our safe passage to Gaza,\\" wrote Robert Naiman, policy director at the advocacy group Just Foreign Policy, who said he'll be part of the flotilla. The State Department counters that, if the activists want to help the citizens of Gaza, there is a better -- and legal -- way to do it. Victoria Nuland, the department's spokeswoman, told reporters, \\"We've got to use the channels that are safe, the channels that are going to guarantee that the aid get where it needs to go to the people it's intended for.\\" Clinton added Thursday that it would be unwise to move toward Israeli waters and create \\"a situation in which the Israelis have the right to defend themselves.\\" But these words did not impress Abunimah, who wrote that \\"in light of Clinton's statements, if any blood is spilled it will not only be on Israeli, but also American hands.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1. The U.S. State Department has warned Americans not to join an activist flotilla intending to challenge Israel's maritime blockage of the Gaza strip, commemorating a previous flotilla's one-year anniversary where a clash with Israeli navy commandos resulted in nine deaths. 2.

The U.N. Human Rights Council accused Israel of committing \\"serious violations of international law\\" in the raid, while Israel called the report biased and one-sided. 5. The U.S. State Department issued a travel warning against traveling to Gaza by sea, highlighting potential injury, arrest, deportation, and prosecution by the Israeli government. 6. Activists argue that the blockade is illegal and undermines Gaza's economy, while Israel maintains the blockade is important to prevent weapon deliveries to Gaza. 7. Protesters plan to send a U.S.-flagged vessel named \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" carrying passengers, crew, and journalists to directly provide aid to Gaza's citizens. 8. The State Department recommends using legal channels to provide aid to Gaza, but some activists accuse Hillary Clinton of providing a green light for a potential Israeli military attack on the activist flotilla."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a breakdown of the potential outcomes: 1. Medium: This answer does not provide any clear information about the effects of eating spicy food, as \\"medium\\" could refer to the level of spiciness in the food or could simply be an unrelated term. 2. Illness: Consuming spicy food, especially if you are not used to it, might cause some discomfort or mild gastrointestinal issues, but it is unlikely to directly cause serious illness. However, if the spicy food is contaminated or if you have a specific allergy or intolerance to an ingredient, it could potentially lead to illness. 3. Throwing up: For some individuals, consuming extremely spicy food may cause nausea and vomiting due to irritation of the gastrointestinal tract. This reaction is more likely if the person eating the spicy food is not accustomed to spicy dishes or has a sensitivity to certain spicy ingredients. 4. Heartburn: This answer is the most accurate outcome of consuming spicy food for a majority of people. Heartburn is a burning sensation in the chest, often due to acid reflux. Eating spicy foods can trigger or worsen heartburn for some individuals because capsaicin, the active compound in chili peppers responsible for the spicy sensation, can cause the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus and leading to heartburn. 5. Sleepiness: Eating spicy food does not typically cause sleepiness. It might have an opposite effect, as the stimulation from the spicy sensation could temporarily increase alertness. However, if you eat a large, high-calorie meal that includes spicy foods, it may lead to temporary sleepiness due to general post-meal fatigue. In conclusion, eating spicy food can lead to a range of reactions, but among the options presented, heartburn is the most plausible and commonly experienced reaction for many individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Earthquakes let scientists know where the crust was moving. This led to the discovery that the Earths crust was broken up into regions, or plates. Earthquakes happen most often along these plate boundaries. This was evidence that continents can move. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The Earths crust is divided into plates. There are about a dozen large plates and several small ones. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Scientists know he plates are in motion. They now know the direction and speed of this motion . Plates dont move very fast. They move only a few centimeters a year.

But as always, there are other subplots to watch, too. Here's a rundown of what the pundits are saying: Based on dozens of polls, Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight projection system gives Romney a whopping 97% chance of victory, predicting that he'll win around 44% of the vote, to Newt Gingrich's 29.3%. That's close to the final Florida poll from PPP, which has Romney winning 39% to 31%. Indeed, Romney has a sizeable lead already. At least 15% of Florida Republicans voted in advance, the Washington Post reports, and one poll suggests Romney won that round 55% to 24%. Romney's victory would be especially significant because Florida is so diverse, the Wall Street Journal adds; a win would indicate that he is indeed the candidate best poised to beat Obama. Politico will be watching a few key demographics with interest. Will Gingrich's marital shenanigans hurt him with women, as they didn't in South Carolina? And will Romney win over Hispanics, as he didn't in 2008? (Polls indicate that he will.) Gingrich's totals in the Panhandle and northeast will be interesting as well—those are the regions most similar to South Carolina. And then there's Rick Santorum. He devoted no resources to Florida, but if his total is too low, expect calls for him to drop out to intensify. The apparent inevitability of Romney's victory already has some candidates shifting focus to Nevada—which means that whatever happens, this rodeo ain't over. Expand this summary.","completion":"Voters in Florida are casting their ballots today, and many polls indicate that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has a strong chance of emerging victorious. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight projection system, based on multiple polls, gives Romney an impressive 97% chance of victory, predicting he will win around 44% of the vote while Newt Gingrich receives 29.3%. This is consistent with the final Florida poll from PPP, which has Romney leading 39% to 31%. Romney's sizeable lead is further demonstrated by early voting statistics, with at least 15% of Florida Republicans having already cast their votes. According to a poll, Romney took 55% of the early ballots compared to Gingrich's 24%. Romney's success in Florida is particularly significant because of the diversity of the state, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, suggests he is the candidate best poised to challenge President Obama. Political analysts will be keeping an eye on certain demographics in the contest: Gingrich's marital history, for instance, failed to affect his performance in South Carolina, but it remains to be seen whether this will have an impact on his relationship with female voters in Florida. Similarly, it will be crucial for Romney to secure support from Hispanic voters, which he failed to do in 2008. Both Gingrich's totals in the northeastern Panhandle and Romney's performance among Hispanic voters will help determine the outcome. Also under observation is Rick Santorum, who chose not to invest resources in the Florida race. If his final vote count is too low, there may be increased pressure for him to withdraw from the contest. With many candidates already turning their attention to Nevada, it is clear that the race for the Republican nomination is far from over, regardless of the outcome in Florida."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, both sentences are about the number of aircraft and their usage. Sentence 1: There were also 58 liaison aircraft but 20 of these were only used for messengers. Sentence 2: There were also 58 connecting aircraft, but 20 of these were used for messengers only. Step 2: Identify the main components and analyze if they convey the same meaning. Both sentences have: - the same number of aircraft (58), - a similar term to describe the aircraft (liaison and connecting), and - the same information regarding their usage (20 of them were used for messengers). Step 3: Determine if the change in wording alters the overall meaning. The replacement of \\"liaison\\" with \\"connecting\\" does not change the overall meaning. Both terms imply a function that connects people or places through communication. Additionally, the phrasing of the aircraft usage (being for messengers) remains consistent with a minor reordering of words.

At first,the local people on the island were very kind to the European visitors,giving them allthe food and clothes they needed to survive.However,as the months passed,the local people became more and more unhappy with their guests,who were tricking and stealing from them.Finally the locals decided to stop helping.Without food or any way to leave the island,Columbus's group was soon in serious trouble. Luckily for Columbus,he had a book about the stars and planets on his ship.It described the movements of all the objects in the night sky.The book,written by a well-known German scientist,said there would be a total lunar eclipse on the evening of February 29,1504 and how long it would last. Columbus worked out the difference in time between Germ any and North America.He then had a meeting with the local leaders just before the eclipse would take place.In this meeting,Columbus told them his god was angry because the local people were no longer giving food.So his god would take away the moon to punish them.The moment Columbus finished talking,just as he had planned,the moon began disappearing. The local leaders grew frightened and quickly agreed to provide Columbus with food and anything else he wanted.But first,Columbus's god had to return the moon.Columbus told them he would have to discuss the idea with his god on his ship.Knowing the moon would stay completely hidden for about 48 minutes,Columbus returned just before the moon began to reappear.From that day on,until they finally left,Columbus and his men no longer had any trouble getting the food they needed.

Article: Find someone interesting you know and ask them to be the subject of your reality show. You could also find a group of people or a business in your town to focus on. Avoid pitching a show that’s about celebrities or exotic, far off places; you probably won’t have access to them when you’re just starting out. Up front you’ll need to decide how your show will be structured. There are two main structures for reality shows: Self-contained. Self-contained reality shows contain episodes that stand on their own. There’s no storyline that connects all of the episodes together. Viewers can watch the episodes out of order and it won’t make a difference. Think: Extreme Home Makeover, Fear Factor, and Hoarders. Self-contained shows are generally easier to sell because networks like that viewers can join in at any time in the season. Arced. Arced reality shows have an overarching storyline that connects every episode. Viewers need to watch the episodes in order to understand what’s going on. Examples of arced reality shows are The Real World, Survivor, and The Bachelorette. Arced reality shows are harder to sell to networks because they're riskier; if audiences don't tune in for episode one, the rest of the season could be a bust. Format style reality shows have a similar format they return to each episode. Dancing with the Stars is an example of a format reality show; every episode features the dancers performing a new routine. The audience expects that tuning in. A format reality show is a good choice if your show will feature different characters or storylines each episode. If your reality show is about parents moving into their kid's college dorm for a week, you could have a different family in each episode. The parents moving into the dorm each episode would be the format people would come to expect. Docu-style reality shows don't have a format; they just follow the main characters around as they go about their lives. Keeping Up with the Kardashians is an example of a docu-style reality show. A docu-style reality show is a good option if the premise of your show is examining an interesting person or group of people as they navigate their world. If you're making a show about a retired pilot, filming like a documentary will be easier than trying to come up with a format for your character to repeat every episode.

Movie title: Django Unchained Movie plot: In 1858, Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave, is chained to a bunch of other slaves and being marched to his new owner's estate in Texas by the Speck brothers. At nightfall, a German man in a dentist cart pulls up and hails the Speck brothers. He introduces himself as Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz).Schultz is clearly more intelligent and enlightened than the Specks. He says he is looking for a slave who can identify a band of wanted fugitives known as the Brittle brothers. Django announces that he knows the Brittle brothers and can identify them. Schultz offers to buy Django, but his polite and educated manner rubs the ill-mannered Specks the wrong way, and Ace Speck threatens to shoot him with his shotgun. In response, Schultz lowers his lantern, whips out a revolver, and shoots Ace, then Dicky's horse, causing Dicky to fall off his horse. The horse carcass then lands on and crushes Dicky's leg, leaving him screaming in pain. Crippled, he agrees to sell Django, and Schultz pays the man (for both Django, and the dead Speck's horse), gets an official title to Django, and prepares to ride off.Before Schultz leaves, however, he frees the remaining slaves (clearly, Schultz finds slavery abhorrent) and says that they may either carry the remaining Speck brother back to town, or shoot him and flee. As Django and Schultz ride off, we hear Speck pleading for his life. We hear a gunshot and can see blood splatter as Dicky's brains are blown out.Django and Schultz arrive in the small town of Daughtrey near El Paso. As they travel through the streets, townspeople stop to stare in disbelief at the sight of a nigger on a horse, much to Schultz's confusion. As Schultz ties his cart down at a hitching post, he checks some papers to make sure he's in the right place.

Answer:","completion":"The feelings and reactions of others surrounding Casey and his relationship with the girl he truly loves may vary depending on various factors such as their relationship to Casey, their own personal beliefs, and experiences. Here's a detailed exploration of how different people might feel in relation to Casey's situation. 1. Friends of Casey: Casey's friends are likely to feel happy for him if they see that he is genuinely in love and that his relationship is a positive and healthy one. They may feel content that he has found someone who makes him happy and try to be supportive. However, there could be certain friends who might feel jealous or left out, particularly if they are single or unhappy in their own relationships. This could result in them feeling resentment or even attempting to negatively influence Casey's relationship. 2. Family Members of Casey: Casey's family may have mixed feelings, depending on each individual's perspective. For instance, his parents might feel happy and supportive if they believe the girl he is dating is kind and well-suited for him. On the other hand, they could feel worried or apprehensive if they have concerns about the girl's character, background, or their compatibility with Casey. His siblings might feel a sense of joy, protectiveness, or even jealousy depending on their own experiences and relationships. 3. Friends of the Girl: The girl's friends could also have diverse reactions to the relationship. If they see that their friend is happy and well-treated by Casey, then they would likely feel happy for her and supportive of the relationship. Nevertheless, similar to Casey's friends, they might experience feelings of jealousy, exclusion, or negative emotions if they perceive their relationship as being threatened or affected by the new romance. 4. Family Members of the Girl: Much like Casey's family, the girl's family members could also have varied reactions. If they believe that Casey is a good partner for their family member, they would likely feel pleased, welcoming, and supportive. However, they might feel apprehensive or concerned if they have doubts about Casey or the future of the relationship. Cultural and personal beliefs may also play a role in shaping their feelings. 5. Ex-partners or Crushes of Both Parties: Ex-partners or people who might have had interest or history with either Casey or the girl could feel a range of emotions from sadness and disappointment to jealousy, bitterness, or anger. The intensity of these feelings might differ based on how much time has passed since their past relationships and their current emotional state. 6. Acquaintances and The Broader Community: While acquaintances and the broader community might not have a strong emotional response to Casey's relationship, their feelings would mostly depend on their own experiences, beliefs, and values. Generally, they might feel happy for the couple but could be indifferent or mildly curious. In rare cases, some individuals might express negativity if they harbor pre-existing biases against either person or their relationship dynamic.

The first sentence: \\"We intend to appeal vigorously and still expect to be vindicated ultimately.\\" In this sentence, the user is strongly resolved to appeal a decision and believes that in the end they will be absolved or proven right. The second sentence: \\"We think this was bad law, and we still expect to be vindicated ultimately.\\" This sentence indicates the user's belief that a law or statute is incorrect or unjust, and similarly, they firmly believe that they will ultimately be absolved or proven right. While both sentences indeed express the user's expectation of ultimate vindication, they differ in the reasons they offer for this expectation. In the first sentence, the expectation is due to a vigorous appeal, while in the second sentence, the expectation is due to a belief in the injustice of the law.

Text: Sleep deprivation is the second most common trigger of seizures. In some cases, it has been responsible for the only seizure a person ever suffers. However, the reason for which sleep deprivation can trigger a seizure is unknown. One possible thought is that the amount of sleep one gets affects the amount of electrical activity in one's brain. Question: can lack of sleep cause seizures in adults?","completion":"Yes, lack of sleep or sleep deprivation can potentially cause seizures in adults. Sleep deprivation is considered to be the second most common trigger of seizures and, in some cases, has even been responsible for the only seizure a person experiences. Although the exact reason for sleep deprivation leading to seizures is unknown, there are several hypotheses and potential mechanisms that can help explain this occurrence. Seizures are the result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, and sleep plays a critical role in regulating the brain's normal electrical activity. Insufficient sleep can disturb the balance of electrical activity, making the brain more susceptible to seizures. Below are some possible explanations for the link between sleep deprivation and seizures: 1. Effect on brain chemicals: Sleep plays an essential role in maintaining the balance of neurotransmitters – chemicals that transmit signals between nerve cells. Sleep deprivation may interrupt this balance, leading to reduced inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and increased excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate. An imbalance in these chemicals could cause excitability in the brain, increasing the risk of seizures. 2. Altered brain activity: Sleep is vital for the normal functioning of the brain, enabling essential processes like memory consolidation, information processing, and cognitive function. To function correctly, the brain undergoes regular cycles of electrical activity during sleep. Sleep deprivation may disrupt these cycles and alter brain activities, potentially increasing the chances of a seizure. 3. Increased stress and fatigue: Sleep deprivation can lead to increased levels of stress, anxiety, and fatigue, all of which can impact the brain's electrical activity. These factors can lower the seizure threshold – the level of stimulation required to trigger a seizure – making an individual more vulnerable to seizures. 4. Aggravation of pre-existing conditions: Sleep deprivation can worsen symptoms or trigger seizures in individuals with pre-existing conditions like epilepsy. Sleep disturbances are common in people with epilepsy, and inadequate sleep can make seizure control more challenging. 5. Circadian rhythm disruption: The body's internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm, regulates various physiological processes, including the sleep-wake cycle. Disruptions in this cycle due to sleep deprivation can affect the brain's electrical activity. Factors like changes in melatonin production, body temperature regulation, and hormone levels may contribute to the relationship between sleep deprivation and seizure risk. It is essential to emphasize that while sleep deprivation can increase the risk of seizures in adults, these risks differ among individuals. Some people may be more susceptible to sleep deprivation-induced seizures due to genetic factors or pre-existing medical conditions. Maintaining good sleep hygiene and ensuring adequate sleep on a regular basis can help lower the risk of sleep-deprivation-related seizures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Greg studied Biology, and his younger cousin Dawn decided to study chemistry. They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae. But I can use this background: Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain.

Context: British colonial rule in the region of modern-day Malawi, where the revolt occurred, began between 1899 and 1900, when the British sought to increase their formal control over the territory to preempt encroachment by German or Portuguese colonial empires. The region became a British protectorate in 1891 and in 1907, was named Nyasaland. Unlike many other parts of Africa, where British rule was dependent on the support of local factions, in Nyasaland British control rested on military superiority. During the 1890s the colonial authorities put down numerous rebellions by the local Yao, Ngoni and Cewa peoples. British rule in Nyasaland radically altered the local indigenous power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most of the land acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work and the demand for labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata. Question: How many years after the region became a British protectorate in 1891, was it named Nyasaland? Answer:","completion":"The region became a British protectorate in 1891 and was named Nyasaland in 1907. To find out how many years passed between these two dates, subtract 1891 from 1907. 1907 - 1891 = 16 Therefore, it was named Nyasaland 16 years after it became a British protectorate."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Stratosphere - This is where airplanes fly and where a special thing called the ozone layer lives. It protects us from the sun's strong rays. 3. Mesosphere - This layer is higher up and colder. When shooting stars fall from space, they burn up here. 4. Thermosphere - This layer is very hot, and the air up here is very thin. This is where the Northern and Southern Lights happen. 5. Exosphere - This is the last layer before space, and is the thinnest layer. Only a few air particles float up here. Second question: The innermost layer of the atmosphere is the troposphere. It's the first layer closest to the ground, where we live, and where the weather happens. These two questions are not the same.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Local white vigilantes tie Wylie to a truck and drag his body through town, for all the community to see, before hanging him from a tree. The sheriff's widow, Edna Spalding, is left to raise her children alone and maintain the family farm. The bank has a note on the farm and money is scarce; the price for cotton is plummeting and many farms are going under. The local banker, Mr. Denby, pays her a visit. He begins to pressure her to sell the farm as he doesn't see how she can afford to make the loan payments on her own let alone run the farm. A drifter and handyman, a black man by the name of Moses, appears at her door one night, asking for work. He offers to plant cotton on all her acres and cites his experience. Edna declines to hire him but offers him a meal instead and sends him on his way. In desperation, Moses steals some of her silver spoons before he leaves.

When the police capture Moseswith her stolen silver, and bring him back to confirm the theft, Edna seizes the opportunity. She lies to the police and says he is her hired man.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). Now, I have a new situation: Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). Answer this question please: Which person studied less about the Andes of South America? A:","completion":"The person who studied less about the Andes of South America is Pam. Here's the reasoning: The Andes of South America is mentioned in the background as an area where large regions of alpine tundra occur. Alpine tundra is consistently mentioned in context of high altitude environments on mountains. Regarding latitude, the background information mentions that between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres. This underscores the presence of alpine environments such as the Andes within these latitudes. Considering these pieces of information, it's reasonable to deduce that the Andes of South America falls within the lower latitudes range of 30°N to 20°S. Since Alice studied these lower latitudes, she would have studied more about the Andes than Pam, who focused her studies on the higher latitudes of 70 to 50°N.

Given the question: Information: - The Inclosure Acts (or \\"Enclosure Acts\\" in modern spelling) was a series of United Kingdom Acts of Parliament which enclosed open fields and common land in the country, creating legal property rights to land that was previously considered common. Between 1604 and 1914, over 5,200 individual Enclosure Acts were put into place, enclosing . - Common land is land owned collectively by a number of persons, or by one person, but over which other people have certain traditional rights, such as to allow their livestock to graze upon it, to collect firewood, or to cut turf for fuel. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Enclosure (sometimes inclosure) was the legal process in England during the 18th century of enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm. Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. In England and Wales the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of arable farming in open fields. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (\\"enclosed\\") and \\"deeded\\" or \\"entitled\\" to one or more owners. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands. - Stourbridge is a large town in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, in the West Midlands of England. Historically a part of Worcestershire, Stourbridge was a centre of glass making, and today includes the suburbs of Amblecote, Lye, Norton, Oldswinford, Pedmore, Wollaston, Wollescote and Wordsley. - Hereford and Worcester was an English county created on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 from the areas of the former administrative county of Herefordshire, most of Worcestershire (except Halesowen, Stourbridge and Warley, which became part of the West Midlands) and the county borough of Worcester. An aim of the Act was to increase efficiency of local government: the two counties are among England's smaller and less populous counties, particularly after the same Act transferred some of Worcestershire's most urbanised areas to the West Midlands. The merger aroused much opposition from Herefordshire people, many of whom regarded it as not a merger but a takeover by Worcestershire. - Herefordshire (abbreviated Herefs. or Hfds.) is a historic English county in the West Midlands. It is a ceremonial county and a unitary non-metropolitan county and district, also named in legislation as the County of Herefordshire and governed by Herefordshire Council. It borders the English ceremonial counties of Shropshire to the north, Worcestershire to the east, Gloucestershire to the south-east, and the Welsh preserved counties of Gwent to the south-west and Powys to the west.

A judge described a teenage rape victim as ‘extremely foolish’ and ‘unwise’ for getting very drunk as he jailed the two men who attacked her. Craig Whitelaw and Kristofer McLaren, both 21, raped the 18-year-old student in an alley after leading her from a nearby nightclub in an ‘inebriated’ condition. Earlier the young woman had been seen ‘stumbling’ around and ‘throwing herself’ at men inside the club, Teesside Crown Court was told. Jailed: Craig Whitelaw, left, and Kristofer McLaren, right, both 21, are beginning nine-year jail sentences for 'a rape of the most squalid kind' after they attacked a woman they had just met on the dancefloor of a nightclub. After her 50-minute ordeal the victim was dishevelled, distressed and covered in blood, with cuts and bruises to her back. Jailing both men for nine years, Mr Justice Males said that the victim was ‘extremely foolish,’ commenting: ‘She became so drunk that she was vulnerable and defenceless to your exploitation.’ But he also told the defendants: ‘There should be no doubt what you did was still rape, and rape of the most squalid kind. ‘Your victim was very unwise to allow herself to drink so much that she became so thoroughly inebriated. But it was you, and only you, who deliberately took advantage of her condition ... to see what fun you could have with her. 'It's just lasses attention-seeking': What Whitelaw, pictured arriving at court for an earlier hearing, said of the victim after he was arrested by police. ‘It was you who decided to treat her body as a plaything on which to act out your sordid fantasies of having a threesome.’ The case comes at a time of huge controversy over the rape laws and the issue – which featured in the conviction of footballer Ched Evans – of a victim being too drunk to consent. The court heard the woman kissed McLaren and Whitelaw, and CCTV showed them ‘leading her outside’ within 15 minutes of meeting her at Club Amadeus in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. Paul Newcombe, prosecuting, told the jury the men saw her as ‘an easy target’ and ignored her pleas that she wanted to go back to her friends as they went outside. The pair bragged to a taxi driver about the ‘threesome’ as they left the scene last August and exchanged jokey texts about what they had done. One described the incident as ‘funny as ****’. Abattoir worker Whitelaw admitted downing more than a dozen pints of lager as well as a vodka and cola. McLaren told police that he had had seven pints. The victim was later found to have blood alcohol levels that were double the legal driving limit. The jury convicted each man of a charge of rape, and Whitelaw of a count of sexual assault. They were cleared of another rape offence. When Whitelaw was arrested, he admitted having sex, but claimed it was consensual, and said: ‘It’s just lasses attention-seeking.’ McLaren, a former sales worker who had been due to study law at university, later admitted having intercourse. He initially told police: ‘I saw what went on, but I had no part in it.’ After the case Katie Russell from Rape Crisis said the judge’s comments about the victim being extremely foolish were ‘unhelpful’. But she added: ‘The judge makes it clear that 100 per cent of responsibility for this crime is down to these two men.’ Inebriated: Whitelaw and McLaren had been drinking for most of the day before going to Club Amadeus, pictured, a popular dance venue in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, where they met their victim. Clare Phillipson, of Wearside Women In Need which supports victims of sexual and domestic violence, said: ‘The only person responsible for rape is the rapist.’ This week research by the Office for National Statistics showed that more than a quarter of the public believe victims of rape or sex attacks are at least ‘a little bit responsible’ if they were drunk. Among 16 to 19-year-olds the proportion rises to one in three. Last month the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must ‘challenge’ the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been ‘drinking.’ The number of recorded sexual offences is at a 10-year high, official figures show. In the year to March 2014 there were a total of 64,205 sex crime incidents across England and Wales, an increase of a fifth on the previous year. Within that, the number of rapes increased 26 per cent to 20,745 incidents, while the number of other sexual offences increased 17 per cent fo 43,460 incidents. The Office for National Statistics said the increases may in part be because victims are more willing to come forward after the high-profile prosecutions of public figures such as Rolf Harris and Fred Talbot. 'While some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the historical crimes reported as part of Operation Yewtree, there is evidence to suggest that there has been a wider \\"Yewtree effect\\",' the ONS said in a statement. 'This refers to an increased willingness on the part of victims of sexual offences that are not directly connected to Yewtree to come forward to report both historical and recent sexual offences.'

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the company that markets pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring? People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971. William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the last names of the four people that led the march and formed a breakaway group? Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival.

Answer the following question: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it.

In test A he used two liquid reactants evenly dispersed, but in test B he used one liquid reactant and one solid reactant. He was surprised to see that two tests had very different results. But I can use this background: Many reactions take place in solution or in the gas phase, where the reactants are evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture. However, for reactions in which one of the reactants is a pure solid or liquid (meaning that this reactant is not already mixed together with any other reactants), reactivity only occurs at the surface, where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants. All of the molecules or ions in the interior of the pure substance will not be colliding with the other necessary reactants, so they are not really contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. However, increasing the surface area will increase the frequency of potentially reactive collisions, because more reactant particles will be in contact with the other necessary reactants. What is an answer for this question: In which test more reactant particles would be in contact with other reactants, test A or test B? Answer:","completion":"In test A, more reactant particles would be in contact with other reactants.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who is decided to not be an enemy of the Amazons? In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.

Please write a short summary for the following article: An exclusive peek inside The Dubai Mall Part of complete coverage on updated 9:21 PM EST, Wed March 5, 2014 (CNN) -- It may seem stunning that one of the most visited tourist attractions on the planet is a mall. Attracting 75 million visitors a year, The Dubai Mall gets more foot traffic than the Eiffel Tower, Niagara Falls and Disney World combined. Of course, The Dubai Mall is no ordinary shopping center. Billed as the world's largest (in terms of total floor space) by the Guinness World Records when it first opened in 2008, the mall is larger than 50 football pitches. It houses 1,200 stores, an Olympic-sized ice skating rink, an aquarium, the world's largest shoe store, 14,000 parking spaces, and a Boeing 737 flight simulator. It was no small investment; the entire complex cost 20 billion to build. \\"It's a city within a city,\\" admits Mohamed Alabbar, chairman of Emaar, the development company responsible for building the mall. It's a city within a cityMohamed Alabbar, Emaar As one can imagine, running such an enterprise is challenging, and it takes a lot of man power. With 20,000 employees, the mall's staff is equivalent to the size of a small army. \\"To make it work, you need to have a tremendous amount of people that are on the job 24 hours a day,\\" says David Macadam, CEO of the Middle East Council of Shopping Centers. Though the mall closes at 10pm (midnight on the weekends), in some ways it is busiest after hours, when a cleaning crew of 100 sweep, vacuum and polish over 1.5m square feet of space every night. \\"It's a huge mall,\\" notes Ahmen Hussein, the night shift supervisor for cleaning. \\"We have to finish before the opening hour. Sometimes we only have five or six hours to do it. It's hard, but we like the challenge.\\" An even more arduous cleaning task sits just outside the malls doorstep. The Burj Khalifa Lake -- an 150m liter artificial body of water that also houses The Dubai Fountain -- requires daily maintenance, partly because the desert climate itches to contaminate it with sand. \\"The job is to target the areas where we have the highest sand accumulation, and clean it in a systematic way,\\" says Jean Hanna, director of operations for The Dubai Fountain. In addition to the human staff, there are underwater robotic vacuums employed to undertake the task. Despite the manpower that goes in to running the mall, Alabbar concedes that even more can be done to ensure it lives up to its full potential: \\"We've tried really hard to make sure it's prestigious, respected, looks after people, customers, companies, shareholders -- the whole thing. I think we're getting there.

A. breathe B. experience sadness C. forget nothing D. remember everything E. to get food The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is D. remember everything. The elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier because it is widely believed that elephants have excellent memories, often referred to as \\"an elephant never forgets.\\" This phrase stems from their natural ability to remember important events, individuals, and locations over a long period of time. In this context, the elephant was asked to recall a number to test and showcase its exceptional memory skills. Option A (breathe) is not an appropriate answer, as it is unrelated to memory or recalling numbers. Breathing is a vital, involuntary function performed by elephants and other living beings to maintain life. Option B (experience sadness) also doesn't explain why the elephant was asked to recall a number. Experiencing sadness is an emotional response and doesn't directly correlate with remembering specific information. Option C (forget nothing) is closely related to the best answer, as it addresses the elephant's apparent ability to retain information. However, it is an exaggeration to say that elephants forget nothing, as every living being has some limitations to their memory. Therefore, option D (remember everything) is a more suitable answer, as it captures the essence of the question without overstating the elephant's abilities. Option E (to get food) is not relevant to the context of remembering a number. While elephants need food to survive, recalling a number would not directly help them acquire sustenance.

What can be a term for food served with potatoes????","completion":"A term for food served with potatoes can be \\"potato-based dishes\\" or \\"potato-accompanied meals.\\" Potato-based dishes refer to meals where potatoes are the primary or essential ingredient, and their presence significantly contributes to the overall flavor, texture, and appeal of the dish. Examples of potato-based dishes include mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, french fries, potato gratin, and potato salad, among others. These dishes can be served as a main course or as a side dish. On the other hand, potato-accompanied meals refer to dishes where potatoes are included alongside other key ingredients or served as a side dish to complement the main course. This term emphasizes that potatoes are a substantial part of the meal but do not necessarily define the dish itself. Examples of potato-accompanied meals include steak and potatoes, shepherd's pie, fish and chips, and potatoes served with roasted or grilled chicken or vegetables. In both cases, potatoes are a versatile and satisfying component that provides substance, texture, and flavor to the dish. They can be prepared using various methods, such as boiling, baking, frying, roasting, or grilling.

Title: The Hunted Movie plot: Paul Racine, a computer-chip executive from New York, is on a business trip to Nagoya. He meets Kirina in the hotel lounge, and they have a one-night stand. Kirina is approached by Kinjo and two ninjas. Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, but Kinjo was not among them. The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving Kinjo motivation to kill Paul and Takeda. On the island, Paul spends time with the drunken blacksmith Oshima, who is constructing a sword for Takeda, and the old man teaches him about smithing and swordsmanship. Mieko explains the history of the two clans' conflict and the samurai concepts of courage and honor.

He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: At age 61, identical twins Jeanne and Susan no longer look exactly alike. Susan smoked for many years and is an admitted sun worshipper, whose habits Jeanne does not share. A new study of twins suggests you can blame those coarse wrinkles, brown or pink spots on too much time in the sun, smoking, and being overweight. Because twins share genes, but may have different exposures to environmental factors, studying twins allows an \\"opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility ,\\" Dr. Elma D. Baron, at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, and his colleagues explain in the latest issue of Archives of Dermatology. Their analysis of environmental skin-damaging factors in 65 pairs of twins hints that skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors. But when it comes to skin cancer, the researchers say their findings support previous reports that both environment and genes affect skin cancer risk. Baron's team examined facial skin of 130 twins, 18 to 77 years old, who lived mostly in the northem Midwest and Eastern regions of the US, who were attending the Twins Days Festival in Ohio in August 2002. At this time, each of the twins also separately reported how their skin burned or tanned without sunscreen, their weight, and their history of skin cancer, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The study group consisted of 52 fraternal and 10 identical twin pairs, plus 3 pairs who were unsure of their twin status. From these data, the researchers noted strong ties, outside of twin status, between smoking, older age, and being overweight, and having facial skin with evidence of environmental damage. By contrast, sunscreen use and drinking alcohol appeared related to less skin damage. Baron and his colleagues say the current findings, which highlight ties between facial aging and potentially avoidable environmental factors--such as smoking, being overweight, and unprotected overexposure to the sun's damaging rays--may help motivate people to minimize these risky behaviors.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. Students in a chemistry class are performing experiments using two different compounds. The first compound, compound A, has a high number of hydrogen bonds between molecules of the compound. The second compound, compound B, has a low number of hydrogen bonds between the molecules of the compound. Aside from this difference, the molecular structure between the two compounds is similar. Which compound will require less energy to undergo state changes? A:","completion":"Compound B will require less energy to undergo state changes. Since it has a lower number of hydrogen bonds between its molecules compared to compound A, it will require less energy to separate the molecules from each other during changes of state, such as melting and boiling.

Five years ago, Roberto Rodriguez, 29, found himself in the midst of a horrifying tragedy and stayed silent, only to find closure as justice has finally been served. Darlene Haynes, the mother of his now five-year-old daughter, was brutally killed back in July 2009 when Julie Corey, posing as her friend, gruesomely carved out the unborn baby from her womb. Last week, Rodriguez saw the end of this horrific chapter in his life as his late partner's killer - and a former friend- Julie Corey, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison today. In a chilling and inexplainable act, Corey cruelly killed Darlene Haynes, and then attempted to pass off the 4lb premature baby girl as her own. However, her appalling deception came to an end when she was caught and apprehended two days later. In an exclusive interview, Rodriguez, the father of the now five-year-old girl, said, \\"If I told her how she had been born, what would she think?\\" He has kept silent about the atrocious murder all this time to protect his daughter, allowing her to live a life away from the heartrending situation that took place even before her birth. However, Rodriguez's silence in all these years also stems from the lingering accusations and claims that he, too, had some involvement with the murder of his child's mother. He laments, \\"I'll always be known as some scumbag, but I don't care now. The person who did this has got what they deserve.\\" The conviction of Julie Corey and her sentencing to life in prison offers the innocent and tormented father a chance to finally let go of the horrific past that seemed to haunt him. The devastating story of Roberto Rodriguez and the tragic birth of his daughter brings to light the cruelty people are capable of when it comes to betrayal. It underscores the importance of healing and overcoming the emotional trauma that comes with such experiences. As the years pass by, Rodriguez and his daughter will continue their journey to heal from the lingering effects of Darlene's gruesome murder. Thanks to the diligent work of investigators, jurors, and the legal system, the person responsible for robbing them of so much has now been held accountable. In conclusion, the heart-wrenching case of Darlene Haynes' murder serves as a reminder of the atrocities that unfortunate lives often have to endure. Roberto Rodriguez and his daughter's story is one of pain, sorrow, and the relentless pursuit of justice. With the killer now behind bars, the father and daughter can start afresh, remembering Darlene as the loving and caring woman she was, and focusing on the future together. As a community, it is crucial to acknowledge the bravery and resilience exhibited by Rodriguez and his daughter, lending support and understanding to those affected by such unspeakable horrors."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you are given an ambiguous question/query (which can be answered in more than one way) and a clarification statement to understand the query more precisely.

The film's prologue takes places in an area of rural farmland in Dannebrog, Nebraska. While there, Bob Irisen â a storm chaser with the National Weather Service â is driving down a country road to track a freak supercell thunderstorm. As a tornado touches down yards away, right as their daughter arrives home from school, Bob warns a family about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their cellar just before it destroys their farm.Meanwhile, in (the fictional town of) Blainsworth, Nebraska (the book is set in the real-world city of Grand Island),[1][2] teenager Dan Hatch, an aspiring and practicing artist who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather Jack to be an athlete, participates in a bike race and damages his bicycle; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bicycle, Danny and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Danny is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Danny and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Danny to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to a fill-in shift as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work.On the road, while continuing to track the massive storm creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southeast into Blainsworth, as the meteorologist he is radioing to is astonished at the uncharacteristic spring-like nature of the storm system for the fall; while there, he meets Laura and Jenny while getting some coffee at the diner. The action begins after Jack comes home at mid-evening; as he sits down to watch television, the show he is watching is interrupted by a severe weather bulletin reporting about a tornado sighting near Dannebrog, 14 miles (23Â km) northwest of Blainsworth. Several minutes after Jack leaves to check on his mother Belle, who is asleep in her rocking chair as he phones her, tornado sirens blare throughout town, only to cut off abruptly as Danny goes to get Ryan from his crib. The eerie stillness outside afterward suddenly gives way to a violent tornado that approaches Blainsworth's Capital Heights neighborhood, with the sucking noises emitting from the drains notifying Dan and Arthur of its pending arrival; they and Ryan take cover in the basement bathroom's shower as the twister starts to obliterate the Hatches' home.After Dan and Arthur escape from the basement of the leveled house through the collapsing floor beams where the first floor once stood, and look in awe of the rubble that was once the Hatch family's home, Arthur runs into Stacey and Ronnie Vae, who both survived the twister themselves in the Darlington's home (their parents were out of town on a trip back home to California at the time the storm hit). As Dan struggles to find his own family, Laura and Jenny are trapped inside the Salty Dawg, which also gets destroyed by one of the tornadoes. Dan and Stacey then go save Dan's grandmother, Belle, at her farm; the two teenagers find Belle underneath wooden boards blown onto her from off of the partially damaged barn near her house (which itself survived intact).As Dan and Stacey rush in the car to get Belle treated for her injuries, Dan finds Jack on a closed road, with his truck â which was overturned by the tornado, pinning him underneath it â covered in fallen power lines; he pulls Jack out from under the truck (with the help of emergency crews, after an earlier attempt by Dan and Stacey to push the truck in order to free him nearly injures Jack further), seeing this as an opportunity for his father to finally see him as reliable. However, Jack just gives a simple thank-you to the fact that Dan saved him from multiple dangers, even though his stepson may have been the only one down the road who was able to help him as it was blocked by policemen due to it being blocked by the downed lines, debris and broken underground utility lines. Later that night at the shelter, Dan reveals to Stacey that Jack is his stepfather and that his real father, Daniel Sr., was a pilot who was killed in a plane crash when Dan was 6. After telling her that he feels he isn't good enough in Jack's eyes and talks about the good qualities that his stepfather has, Stacey helps Dan consider that the two could try to find some common ground.Eventually, Jack â followed by Dan, who sneaks himself and Ryan into the station wagon loaned to Jack â leave the shelter to go and look for Laura. Just as Bob pulls his truck into the driveway of the destroyed house, helping passengers Jenny and Laura along with him searching for Jack, Dan and Ryan, Jack's station wagon also drives up and the family is reunited. As soon as everyone is relieved they survived the storm, three tornadoes touch down near them. Bob, realizing that there is no adequate shelter available, advises the group to make a run for it in their vehicles. The group narrowly escapes one of the twisters, which picks up a car that the Hatches' neighbors try to outrun the tornado in themselves, destroys several buildings in its path and hurls a tree branch into the windshield, briefly knocking Jack unconscious â causing Dan to take over driving the vehicle out of the storm's path. They, along with Bob and Jenny, make it to an overpass as the twister blows out the back window of the station wagon, nearly sucking Dan out before it dissipates into the air. As they walk out from under the overpass just as the sun rises on a clear day after the storm passes, Jack admits he's proud of Danny for not giving up in the face of adversity and trying to reunite the family.In the film's epilogue, illustrating what happened with the characters one year after the storm, Dan explains that he is now dating Stacey, while Arthur became class president, and Bob and Jenny got married and are becoming first-time parents to twins. He and Jack have also become closer, and Jack is now supportive of him. He also tells that his grandma, Belle, died the following year in 1997.","completion":"1.

Prepare the pot or pan: Before you start cooking, make sure the pot or pan is clean and dry. If you're using a non-stick pan, it might need a little oil or butter so the food doesn't stick. 3. Heat it up: Put the pot or pan on the stove, and set the heat to the right level. This will depend on what you're cooking, so follow the recipe for best results. Wait until it's nice and warm before adding your ingredients. 4. Add the food: Be careful when putting the food in the pot or pan, so you don't get splashed by hot oil or water. Use a spoon, spatula, or your fingers to gently place the food. 5. Stir and cook: Keep an eye on the food while it's cooking, and give it a little stir from time to time to make sure it cooks evenly. You might also need to adjust the heat up or down, depending on how fast it's cooking. 6. Tasty and safe: Make sure your food is cooked all the way through. This is important to keep our tummies happy and healthy! You can use a fork or knife to cut into the food and check if it's ready. 7. Clean up: Once you're done cooking, turn off the stove and move the pot or pan to a safe spot to cool down. When it's cooled, wash it with soapy water, rinse, and dry it, so it's all clean and ready for next time. Don't forget to clean the stove too if there are any spills or splatters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Input: look around right thrice and turn opposite left Output:","completion":"To understand and solve the given command, let's break it down into individual parts and translate them into corresponding actions. 1. \\"look around right\\" - This means the agent should look around while turning right. The corresponding actions are I_LOOK and I_TURN_RIGHT. 2. \\"thrice\\" - This means the command before it (look around right) should be executed three times. 3. \\"and\\" - This connects the previous command scope to the next command scope. 4. \\"turn opposite left\\" - This means the agent should turn in the opposite direction of left, which is turning right. The corresponding action is I_TURN_RIGHT.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".

First, it was transformed into a drawing room by James Wyatt in 1778. During this renovation, the Carolean decoration was removed, and the room was given a vaulted ceiling. The purpose of this transformation was to create a more welcoming and comfortable space for the family and their guests to relax and socialize. Later, in 1876, the room was transformed again, this time into a library. This change in usage allowed the room to house the estate's growing collection of books, which now amounts to approximately 6,000 volumes. The room became a testament to the family's passion for book collecting over 350 years, with nearly 2,300 books catalogued by Lord Tyrconnel in 1754 still remaining in the library today. Overall, these transformations of the Great Dining Room not only signify shifts in the trends and styles of the time but also highlight the changing functional requirements of Belton House's residents. The room has served as a versatile space within the mansion, adapting to various needs and preferences over the years, while always maintaining its status as an essential part of the home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gaius Julius Caesar (; 12 or 13 July 100 BC - 15 March 44 BC), known by his cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Using the Latin alphabet of the period, which lacked the letters J and U, Caesar's name would be rendered GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR; the form CAIVS is also attested, using the older Roman representation of G by C. The standard abbreviation was C. IVLIVS CAESAR, reflecting the older spelling. (The letterform AE is a ligature of the letters A and E, and is often used in Latin inscriptions to save space.) In Classical Latin, it was pronounced ['ga:.i.Us 'ju:l.i.Us 'kaesar]. In the days of the late Roman Republic, many historical writings were done in Greek, a language most educated Romans studied. Young wealthy Roman boys were often taught by Greek slaves and sometimes sent to Athens for advanced training, as was Caesar's principal assassin, Brutus. In Greek, during Caesar's time, his family name was written Kaisar (Kaisar), reflecting its contemporary pronunciation. Thus, his name is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the German Kaiser. In Vulgar Latin, the original diphthong [ae] first began to be pronounced as a simple long vowel [e:]. Then, the plosive /k/ before front vowels began, due to palatalization, to be pronounced as an affricate, hence renderings like ['tSe:sar] in Italian and ['tse:zar] in German regional pronunciations of Latin, as well as the title of Tsar. With the evolution of the Romance languages, the affricate [ts] became a fricative [s] (thus, ['se:sar]) in many regional pronunciations, including the French one, from which the modern English pronunciation is derived. The original /k/ is preserved in Norse mythology, where he is manifested as the legendary king Kjarr. Caesar's cognomen itself became a title; it was promulgated by the Bible, which contains the famous verse \\"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's\\". The title became Kaiser in German and Tsar or Czar in the Slavic languages. The last Tsar in nominal power was Simeon II of Bulgaria, whose reign ended in 1946. This means that for two thousand years after Julius Caesar's assassination, there was at least one head of state bearing his name.

However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid. The characters were engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying. Most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are picture perfect and believable. I like how Emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. I just wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can continue to evolve.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sample would have higher boiling point, sample A or sample C? Hint: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. A:","completion":"Given the information provided, sample C, the cyclic molecule, would have a higher boiling point than sample A, the straight-chain molecule. This is because cyclic molecules generally have higher boiling and melting points compared to straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. The reason for this difference in boiling points lies in the molecular structure and the strength of the intermolecular forces present. In cyclic molecules, the ring structure contributes to stronger intermolecular forces, making it more difficult to break these forces and transition to the gas phase, resulting in a higher boiling point."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Background: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. Paragraph: Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather. While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island had fewer birds with bigger beaks reproduce? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, Bank island experienced severe drought, which led to a diminished food supply on the island. In this situation, it is important to consider the effect of the drought on the finch population, as described in the background information provided. During the drought in the Galápagos, the availability of seeds decreased, with smaller seeds being less available for birds to eat. Birds with larger beaks had an advantage here, as they were able to crack open and consume seeds of all sizes. Consequently, birds with smaller beaks struggled to find enough food to survive, and many died as a result. The larger-beaked birds, on the other hand, were able to continue finding food, thereby surviving and reproducing. As a result of these selective pressures, the average beak size in the finch population increased, indicating evolution by natural selection. In light of this background information, we can infer that Bank island, which experienced the severe drought, would have had fewer birds with smaller beaks survive and reproduce. The larger-beaked bird population, however, would have likely thrived due to their ability to consume a wider variety of seeds. Consequently, there would have been an increase in the number of birds with larger beaks reproducing on Bank island. On the contrary, Port island experienced wet weather over the past three summers. This suggests that the food supply on the island remained stable, as wetter conditions typically promote the growth of plants and, consequently, the production of seeds. Thus, it can be inferred that Port island would have had fewer birds with larger beaks reproduce compared to Bank island. In conclusion, given the circumstances mentioned in the paragraph, Port island had fewer birds with bigger beaks reproduce compared to Bank island. The severe drought on Bank island created an environment where birds with larger beaks had a significant advantage, allowing them to survive, reproduce, and contribute to the increase in average beak size in the finch population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick, and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction. However, the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected, and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the World War II era Army. The recognizable cast is hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams faring best. Stephen Boyd, however, stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn. The obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values. The locations are great, the effects and action are weak. Imagine if \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way Vin Diesel's Caparzo had (except we do get to see the shot because they effects can't handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns drove around in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. Yet, the denouement, with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black, and Boyd's racist Captain being effected by this, is compelling, as are the sequences of of Turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines.

Sentence 1 seems conversational with hesitation and corrections \\"you know it's it's\\", \\"and the and and that\\". It looks like someone is speaking spontaneously, perhaps in a casual or informal setting. It doesn't seem like a formal government document or a letter, definitely not connected to 9/11 or travel. It's not verbatim as verbatim would mean that it's a written record of dictated or recorded speech, and this has many conversational markers. Fiction also seems unlikely because of the conversational informality. This kind of spontaneous talk is typical of face-to-face conversations. So the first one might be 1. FACE-TO-FACE. Sentence 2, on the other hand, is much more structured and coherent, suggesting it might be written or pre-prepared speech, but it still doesn't appear to align with most of our options. The subject is still government, but the way it is delivered does not give us a clear match. It doesn't seem like a telephone conversation. It's not specific to travel or fiction. It seems to be discussing press coverage of an issue, which suggests journalism, and thus the closest match here might be 5. SLATE, which is an online magazine that covers current affairs, politics.

Movie title: Sleeping Beauty Movie plot: After many childless years, King Stefan and Queen Leah happily welcome the birth of their daughter, Princess Aurora. They proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess. At the gathering for her christening she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the young son of King Hubert, Stefan's friend, so that their kingdoms will always be united. Among the guests are three good fairies: Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who have come to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their blessings (beauty and song, respectively). Just before Merryweather can speak, the evil fairy Maleficent appears. Angered upon not being invited to the christening, Maleficent curses the princess, proclaiming that before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of an enchanted spinning wheel and die. After Maleficent leaves, Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse so that Aurora instead will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's first kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they take Aurora away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest, living as mortals, until the day of her sixteenth birthday. Years later, Aurora, renamed Briar Rose, has grown up into a beautiful young maiden. On the day of her sixteenth birthday, the three fairies ask Rose to gather berries in the forest so they can prepare a surprise party for her. Meanwhile, Maleficent, in frustration, has her raven Diablo search for Aurora after her bumbling demon soldiers fail to find her.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Mr Assad also criticised the US-led coalition and its air strikes in Syria and Iraq as counter-productive, saying that terrorism had only spread. Meanwhile, Russia has carried out more air strikes in Syria it says targeted so-called Islamic State (IS) positions. Syrian activists say the raids appear to have focused on other rebel groups. In an interview with Iranian state television, reported by the Syrian presidency Twitter feed, President Assad said Syria, Russia, Iran and Iraq were united in battling terrorism and would achieve \\"practical results\\", unlike the US-led coalition. Mr Assad's international opponents say a negotiated solution to Syria's four-year-old civil war must involve the president stepping down, although some Western nations now say he could remain during a transitional period. But Mr Assad insisted: \\"Discussion about the political system or officials in Syria is an internal Syrian affair.\\" Where key countries stand - Who is backing whom Why? What? How? - Five things you need to know about Russia's involvement What can Russia's air force do? - The US-led coalition has failed to destroy IS. Can Russia do any better? Inside an air strike - Activist describes \\"frightening Russian air strike\\" Syria's civil war explained - Analysis and background on the conflict Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday that its aircraft had bombed 10 IS targets in Syria over the past 24 hours - including command posts, a training camp, ammunition stores and a workshop making explosive devices including suicide belts. It said its air campaign, which began on Wednesday, was being expanded. \\"As a result of our air strikes on Isil [IS] targets, we have managed to disrupt their control system, the terrorist organisation's supply lines, and also caused significant damage to the infrastructure used to prepare acts of terror,\\" the ministry added. Syrian activists said Russian strikes in central Homs province had killed at least two children and a shepherd, and wounded a further 15 people. The Syrian authorities have reportedly detained a prominent opposition figure, days after he criticised the Russian air strikes. Munzer Khaddam, spokesman for the National Co-ordination Committee for Democratic Change, was held at a checkpoint near the capital Damascus, an official from his group told AFP news agency. Turkey and Britain have condemned Russia's military intervention in support of President Assad. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described it as a grave mistake that would further isolate Moscow. In London, Prime Minister David Cameron said Russia's actions would lead to further radicalisation and terrorism. \\"Tragically, what has happened is that most of the Russian air strikes, as far as we have been able to see so far, have been in parts of Syria not controlled by Isil (IS) but controlled by other opponents to the regime. \\"So what is happening is that they are backing the butcher Assad, which is a terrible mistake for them and for the world; it's going to make the region more unstable, it will lead to further radicalisation and increased terrorism. \\"And I would say to them: change direction, join us in attacking Isil but recognise that if we want to have a secure region, we need an alternative leader to Assad. He can't unite the Syrian people.\\" The US-led coalition carried out 16 air strikes against IS militants, weapons and buildings in Syria and Iraq on Saturday, according to a US military statement. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that four years on has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, as well as less numerous so-called \\"moderate\\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. What's the human cost? More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.

Input: To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart. Though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well. Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. Scottland is still run by English nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. There are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor. He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. One of them, known as Archibald Cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. Played wonderfully by Tim Roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother. This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. He rapes Macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Along with another crony of the Marquis (Brian Cox) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt. This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.Spoilers ahead!!!!!Luckily for the MacGregor's, a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. And for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. The first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. The score is quite memorable, too. The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor. The film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy.

Read this: In 1607, English Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke said in the Case of Prohibitions (according to his own report) \\"that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, quod Rex non debed esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.).\\" Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Who spoke about the rule of law in sixteenth century England?","completion":"The person who spoke about the rule of law in the sixteenth century England was Sir Edward Coke. He was a prominent English lawyer, judge, and politician during this time period. In 1607, he served as the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, one of the highest judicial roles in England. Sir Edward Coke is particularly renowned for his development and promotion of the English Common Law—the body of legal norms, rules, and standards that were created by the judiciary through the decisions made in the courts. This system of law has had a profound influence on the legal systems of many countries throughout the English-speaking world, including the United States. His views on the rule of law were famously encapsulated in the Case of Prohibitions in 1607. In his statement, Sir Edward asserted the primacy of the law as the ultimate metric and standard to resolve disputes among subjects—that \\"the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects.\\" Moreover, he underlined that the law safeguarded the monarch himself, ensuring his security and peaceful reign. However, his assertion did not please the King, who took offence at the notion that he too was subject to the law. The King considered this assertion to be treasonous. In response, Sir Edward referred to the works of the medieval jurist Henry de Bracton, noting \\"quod Rex non debed esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege\\" translated as \\"That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.\\" Coke's stand against the King's viewpoint, rooted in the concept of absolute monarchy, signaled a critical shift in the legal and political history of England towards constitutionalism—the idea that government authority is derived from and limited by a constitution. Notably, the rule of law is a foundation principle of modern democracies, ensuring that all individuals and institutions, including the government and the head of state, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated.

Bio: john p. \`\` jack '' walker was an australian rules footballer who played with st kilda in the victorian football league . he was killed while on active service during world war i. The answer to this question is:","completion":"From the given bio of Jack P. Walker, several details can be gathered regarding his personal life, professional career, and his involvement in World War I. 1. Personal Life and Name: John P. Walker was an Australian man, commonly referred to by his nickname \\"Jack.\\" The use of two names suggests that he might have been a casual and friendly individual, as nicknames often signify familiarity and ease in social interactions. 2. Professional Career: Jack P. Walker was an Australian Rules footballer, which means he played the sport, also known as Aussie Rules or simply Football, that combines elements of rugby and soccer with additional unique features. This sport is especially popular in the Australian states of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. It is known for its fast pace, athleticism, and hard-hitting nature. As a footballer for St. Kilda, Jack must have had the athletic prowess and skillset necessary to compete at a professional level. 3. Team Affiliation: Jack played for St. Kilda, a professional Australian Rules football team based in Melbourne. St. Kilda Football Club is a member of the Victorian Football League (VFL), now known as the Australian Football League (AFL) since 1990. The VFL/AFL is the highest level of professional Australian Rules football, indicating that Jack was playing at the top tier of his sport. St Kilda is one of the oldest clubs in the league, founded in 1873, and the club's history suggests that Jack would have been a part of a rich football tradition. 4. World War I Service: Jack P. Walker served in World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918. His participation in the war shows his patriotism and commitment to the defense of his country. As an Australian, he likely enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) or the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF), the primary forces deployed by the Australian government during WWI. 5. Death: Tragically, Jack P. Walker was killed while on active service during World War I. This means that he likely died on the battlefield or as a direct result of military action. His death highlights the immense sacrifices made by many young men during this great global conflict, as well as the impact it had on communities and sports teams back home. Thousands of Australian soldiers lost their lives during World War I, and their stories, like Jack's, remain testament to their bravery and dedication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tatum O Neil goes through the motions in her part, and has some of the corniest lines in film history. Richard Burton looks close to death in this film, and we're supposed to believe he looks \\"Good for sixty\\". The acting is bad, as is the plot. The characters are awful, as is the story. It's really hard to feel for anyone in this film, except Larry Ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on Tatum, he's kind of funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a Tatum fan, like me - which is why I rented it in the first place - please don't see this movie. She is really bad in it, and you'll wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a fluke. It wasn't, because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it's known she can act well, but still, don't rent this movie.

(Reserve Bank of Australia) When the new 5 bank note comes into circulation tomorrow, it will contain a small but hugely important new design feature – making it the first Australian bank note that the visually impaired can read. The inclusion of two raised dots, the size of a “hundreds and thousands” sprinkle, on each of the long sides of the new note are thanks in part to the advocacy of NSW teenager Connor McLeod and his mother Ally Lancaster, who in 2012 began a petition for tactile markings to be included on the reprint of banknotes. \\"We have braille on toilets, we have tactile features on bus stops, but we don't have it on our national currency, and that is something we use every day,\\" Connor's mother Ally Lancaster told AAP. Vision Australia's lead policy advisor Bruce Maguire said the note will give those who are blind or vision-impaired the ability to identify currency accurately and confidently for the first time. NSW teenager Connor McLeod started petitioning the Reserve Bank at age 12 to introduce tactile banknotes so vision impaired and blind people could tell the value of notes. (AAP) \\"I think the introduction of the tactile feature on banknotes is the biggest inclusive effort that I have seen in my lifetime,\\" he said. \\"None of us who are blind have been able to identify notes accurately by touch before and that is something that everybody takes for granted.\\" Over time, all Australian bank notes will have the tactile feature, each with a different number of raised dots in accordance to the denomination.

The townsfolk went about their business, casting surreptitious glances at the imposing gallows, which had been hastily erected in the town square. Mace Bishop, a rugged man with piercing blue eyes and a determination that set his jaw firm, rode into town on his trusted horse Thunder. He had come to Val Verde with one goal in mind: to free his brother, Dee, from the hangman's noose. Dee and his gang were notorious in the region for their reckless lifestyle, and they recently found themselves in hot water after a daring bank heist that went terribly wrong. The Val Verde Savings and Trust Bank was not an easy target, but their greed and arrogance led them to believe they were invincible. In the aftermath of the robbery, Dee and several members of his gang were captured by the local authorities. As news spread, families of the victims demanded justice, and a public execution was the only way to restore order in the shaken town. One of the townsfolk, Maria Stoner, had a particularly bitter reason to see Dee and his gang hanged. During the botched bank robbery, her beloved husband, one of the bank's tellers, had been shot and killed by Babe Jenkins, a ruthless gang member who valued money above human life. Maria's once gentle and compassionate eyes were now clouded with hatred and pain. Having heard of the gang's capture, Mace was determined to save Dee, knowing full well the cost of his actions and the chances of success were slim. He felt a deep sense of responsibility for his brother and couldn't shake the guilt of having left him at a young age, which he believed led Dee down this dark path. Leaving the jail, Dee's gang had split up in search of refuge, leaving a maelstrom of chaos and confusion in their wake. With the scent of blood now fresh in their nostrils, a posse of lawmen had been assembled to track down the remaining fugitives. Their pursuit took on an almost mythical quality, with tales of their tireless search for the scattered gang members spreading far and wide. At the head of the posse, local sheriff July Johnson and his steadfast deputy, Roscoe Bookbinder, valiantly led the chase. Both men had their own motivations to apprehend the gang. The sheriff had his own ambition to see law and order restored in Val Verde, while Roscoe Bookbinder desired retribution for the death of his cousin who was caught in the crossfire of the gang's crimes. Their relentless pursuit led them across the Mexican border into territory policed by bandoleros - ruthless outlaws who showed no mercy to the unwary traveler. The rocky terrain proved challenging and treacherous, and the dry desert air left many a man parched and exhausted. As the posse pushed deeper into unknown lands, their horses taking strained steps under the scorching sun, their determination to bring the fugitives to justice never wavered. Back in Val Verde, Mace Bishop devised a daring plan to rescue Dee from the gallows before the noose could seal his fate. Unbeknownst to him, Maria Stoner, driven by vengeance and weighed down by the burden of her own loss, would become a vital piece of the puzzle in an intricate game that would unfold in the heart of a lawless land. As the sun rose on a fateful day, Mace, the posse, and all involved in the tragic story of Dee's gang were set to collide in a whirlwind of vengeance and brotherly love. The dusty streets of Val Verde would play witness not just to a public execution, but to a breathtaking climax of a tale that would leave the town, much like the lives of the people living in it, forever changed. The chase across the Mexican border would not be an easy one, as the posse, led by the unyielding Sheriff Johnson and the fearless Deputy Bookbinder, would face not just the unforgiving desert, but the untamed bandoleros, who led a life of crime and violence. In the end, the story of Mace Bishop, Dee, and the posse would go down in the annals of history as a bittersweet tale of redemption, justice, and the unbreakable bonds of family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Smiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, a British spy, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in the Circus, as Control had suspected. Smiley chooses a trustworthy agent, Peter Guillam, and retired Special Branch officer Mendel to help him. He interviews Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after deducing that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attachÃ© in London, was a spy. Tarr tells Smiley that, on a mission to Istanbul, he had had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus, but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him and ordered him straight home, whereas Moscow immediately kidnapped Irina. Tarr concluded that the mole had intercepted his message, and went into hiding, suspected of defecting and murdering the British station chief. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to 2 1/2 inches high. The grass at the Augusta Country Club is cut to 4 inches. Sam likes more of a challenge when playing golf but Jack likes to play on turf where the ball rolls easier. But I can use this background: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot. What is an answer for this question: Which Country Club would Jack enjoy playing golf at more, Aurora or Augusta? Answer:","completion":"Jack would most likely enjoy playing golf more at the Aurora Country Club. Since the grass is cut to 2 1/2 inches high, it will make the ball roll easier, which is Jack's preference. The 4-inch grass at Augusta Country Club would pose more of a challenge, which would be more suitable for Sam."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics? ? The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona.

Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums.

Deși Procesul de Stabilizare și Asociere (SAP) a fost conceput pentru a facilita integrarea țărilor din Balcanii de Vest în Uniunea Europeană, acesta prezintă o serie de deficiențe care ar putea deveni din ce în ce mai vizibile în urma primei etape de extindere a UE. În primul rând, mecanismele de monitorizare și evaluare ale SAP nu sunt întotdeauna eficiente sau transparente. Aceasta face ca progresul înregistrat de țările candidate să fie greu de măsurat și evaluat, ceea ce la rândul său poate duce la stagnarea reformelor și la întârzieri în desfășurarea negocierilor de aderare. În al doilea rând, condiționalitatea impusă de SAP în ceea ce privește reformele politice, economice și juridice este adesea considerată excesiv de strictă și inflexibilă. Acest lucru poate duce la dificultăți în implementarea reformelor necesare în țările candidate, în special în contextul unor societăți și instituții fragile, afectate de conflicte sau de corupție endemică. În al treilea rând, resursele financiare și tehnice disponibile prin SAP sunt adesea insuficiente pentru a sprijini în mod adecvat procesul de reformă în țările candidate. Acest lucru poate rezulta în incapacitatea acestora de a aborda provocările complexe legate de dezvoltarea economică, reducerea sărăciei, consolidarea statului de drept și protejarea drepturilor omului.

The film opens with several dynamite blasts to break up the ice that's clogging up the deep-sea drilling rigs. Disappointingly to the company, the drilling rig produces no oil. Baldwin is then picked up from work by an airplane flown by his wife Claudia. On the way home, Claudia tells Michael that she wants to move the kids back to Los Angeles where they can live in a more civilized environment. Michael argues that he cannot just walk away from the exploration since it was his idea. Upon arriving home, Michael and Claudia must deal with their three children arguing with each other about the existence of Santa Claus. To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results. The next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus's chief elf Ed. Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves.

Translate to English","completion":"\\"However, we share the statement made in the resolution proposal regarding biofuels, that high food prices have implications on the distribution sector as well as on food supply security worldwide.\\" This German statement implies a concern about the impact of biofuels on global food pricing and distribution. Biofuels are a type of energy derived from biological materials, often crops such as corn or sugar cane. Because these crops are also a source of food, the production of biofuels can drive up the prices of these crops by increasing demand. This dynamic makes it more expensive for people to purchase these foods, which in turn can contribute to food insecurity, or a lack of consistent access to sufficient food. Furthermore, the rise in food prices can also have an impact on the distribution sector. This sector, which includes businesses that move goods from producers to consumers, may have to increase prices to cope with higher food costs. This increase in prices can add a financial burden to consumers and potentially limit access to other goods or services. In a global context, these impacts can be particularly devastating in regions where poverty levels are high and food insecurity is already a major concern. These areas may be dependent on more developed regions for food imports, and if the prices of these imports increase due to the production of biofuels, it can exacerbate their existing struggles with food insecurity. The resolution proposal mentioned in this statement likely refers to a formal decision or recommendation by a governing body or organization. If this governing body agrees with the concerns outlined, they would be indicating that they believe current biofuel production methods may be negatively affecting worldwide food distribution and security, and that they are in favor of implementing changes to mitigate these impacts. These changes could potentially include implementing more sustainable farming practices, investing in new technology to make biofuel production more efficient and less reliant on food crops, or implementing regulatory measures to control the impact of biofuel production on food prices.

Two U.S. filmmakers were injured Saturday when their small plane crashed into a three-story residential building in downtown Nairobi. People gather around the wreckage of a plane that struck a building in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Saturday. Dan Parris, 25, and Rob Lehr, 26, both from St. Louis, Missouri, were shooting an independent documentary on poverty in Africa. Both men were hospitalized and expected to survive, according to David Peterka, who was part of the film crew, but was not aboard the plane. He said that all four aboard the plane were Americans. A flight engineer, whose name was not released, was critically injured and was in a coma, Peterka said. The pilot, whose name has not yet been released, was killed in the crash. The crew had been in the east African nation for four days and was shooting video of Kibera, one of the largest slums in Africa. The plane was headed to nearby Wilson Airport, where most light aircraft land in the Kenyan capital. \\"The pilot had warned that he was going to hover and go slow,\\" Peterka said. \\"They were surprised when they went to about 50 feet off the ground --- and then they hit electrical lines and the plane flipped into the building.\\" Just before the plane crashed, the listening devices went off and they could not communicate with the pilot, Peterka said. Peterka said Lehr, who was ejected because the doors were open for filming, ran back in to rescue the others. Parris crawled out and Lehr, with the help of bystanders, pulled the pilot and the engineer out as the plane burst into flames, Peterka said. \\"Local residents were using water, dirt to put the fire out\\" before the fire department arrived, Peterka said. \\"Before the plane crashed, witnesses said it was flying unusually low,\\" said Francis Mwaka, a Kenyan federal communications official. The four-seater plane was owned by African Inland Missions company. No one on the ground was injured, Mwaka said. The crash is under investigation. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this story.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

Question 1: \\"Will a Trump Presidency damage the environment so much that we can never recover?\\" This question seems to ask whether actions taken during the time when Donald Trump was president could hurt the environment in such a way that we can't fix it anymore. Kind of like when you break your favorite toy and it's broken so badly that it can't be put back together. Question 2: \\"Can the environment survive a Trump presidency?\\" This question seems to ask if the environment can withstand or endure the actions taken during the time when Donald Trump was president. It's like asking if your toy can survive if you play with it a lot. Now, to the second part of your question - do these questions mean the same thing? Well, they're similar because they both inquire about the impact of Donald Trump's presidency on the environment. But they are not exactly the same. The first one is asking about whether the damage done would be irreversible; so, like we said, if a toy is broken so badly it can't be fixed. The second question is asking if the environment will be able to 'survive' or 'get through' Trump's presidency, which suggests there might be damage, but maybe not as destructive or permanent. It's like asking whether your toy will still be ok if you play with it a lot.

With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system.

There was a boy, who, as it turned out, was an orphan and was living and working for a small farming family. He didn't appear at first glance to ever be fully engaged in the school learning process;he would sit quietly, never seem to get any attention from the teacher, and would spend a lot of time staring out of the window just behind him. Over the next few weeks, I got to know this boy while playing outside in the schoolyard playing baseball, or soccer. He was very athletic and very good at anything we played. I started to wonder why he didn't seem to do well in school and why the teacher ignored him. He told me he had been in several foster homes since he was a little boy and that most of his time in the last few years had always been on farms. He said he was made to work before he went to school and as soon as he got home until it was time for bed. He was never given a chance to go out and play, nor was he allowed to have any friends although he told me he really didn't have any friends anyway, because he was an orphan and they did not want anything to do with him. I had never before been acquainted with prejudice of any kind. Here was one characteristic of a human being who through no fault of his own carried a label that prevented him from even having friends as a child. His potential was also being ignored by the teacher. It wasn't that he couldn't learn, or didn't want to -- it was because he wasn't encouraged or in some cases, allowed to.

Possible A: to be alone, believe in god, enjoy themselves, face each other, group together Why is \\"enjoy themselves\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Enjoy themselves\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense stems from understanding the innate social nature of humans and the primary purpose of parties as social gatherings. In most cultures, attending a party, engaging in conversations, and partaking in the various activities provided are opportunities for amusement, relaxation, and bonding with others. To comprehend why \\"enjoy themselves\\" is the most suitable answer from the given options, let's evaluate each choice: 1. To be alone: Parties are primarily about coming together with others and participating in group activities, so seeking solitude contradicts the main purpose of attending such an event. Though someone might seek a moment of quiet or privacy at times, it is not the primary reason for attending a party. 2. Believe in god: While spirituality and religion hold significant value for many people, parties are generally unrelated to one's faith, with the main focus being social interaction and enjoyment. Religious gatherings and parties may occasionally intersect, but the primary purpose of a party typically does not revolve around deepening one's faith. 3. Enjoy themselves: This answer aligns with the primary purpose of a party, which is to engage in social activities, have fun, and create pleasant memories with friends, family, or colleagues. People attend parties to unwind, experience a variety of emotions, and indulge in the pleasure that comes from such events, making this the most common-sense explanation for attending a party. 4. Face each other: Though facing each other may be a natural part of conversation and interactions during a party, it is not the main reason for attending one. While facing others may be part of the social aspect of the party, it is a rather specific and narrow understanding of the human interactions that take place at such events, and as such, is not a primary reason for attending a party. 5. Group together: Although grouping together may occur during a party, it is merely a reflection of social dynamics and not necessarily the ultimate reason someone would attend a party. People attend parties mainly to socialize, network, and have a good time – not solely to group together. In summary, among the given options, \\"enjoy themselves\\" reflects the primary motivation for attending a party, as it comprehensively acknowledges the fundamental social nature of such events and the personal pleasure and satisfaction derived from them. By understanding the core purpose and essence of parties, it becomes clear why enjoying themselves is the answer that aligns with human common sense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They win it, however the ship is wrecked, but due to botched laser eye surgery, the Professor only notices that the fuel has been used. As punishment, Leela is fitted with a shock collar to teach her anger management. Meanwhile, Bender finds Cubert and Dwight playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons with their friends, but he cannot join in since, as a robot, he has no imagination. After several tries at imagining things, Bender manages to imagine himself as a medieval knight named \\"Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood\\" and enters the game. Unfortunately, he soon gets lost in his fantasy and goes on a rampage, resulting in his commitment to the Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots. The crew learns that Mom, who controls the world's only Dark Matter mine, is restricting the supply in order to drive up profits. The Professor reveals to the crew that while working for her many years ago, he stumbled on a way to turn dark matter from a useless curiosity into starship fuel. The process created two energy crystals, with Mom keeping one for herself and Farnsworth hiding the other, \\"anti-backwards\\" crystal. If the two crystals are brought together, they will render all dark matter useless. Farnsworth has forgotten where he hid his crystal, but it is being used as a 12-sided die in the kids' D&amp;D game. Mom determines its location and sends her sons Walt, Larry and Igner to retrieve it, by saying that they are owl exterminators, but Farnsworth foils their attempt by sending an angry owl at them, messing up their plan since they do not know how to exterminate owls. Farnsworth, Fry, and Leela fly to Mom's mine with the crystal in order to neutralize the dark matter.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977. - The ZX81 is a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in several countries. - Don Priestley (born 1940) is a video game programmer who wrote for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum between 1982 and 1989. - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations. - A game programmer is a software engineer, programmer, or computer scientist who primarily develops codebases for video games or related software, such as game development tools. Game programming has many specialized disciplines, all of which fall under the umbrella term of \\"game programmer\\". A game programmer should not be confused with a game designer, who works on game design. - The Trap Door is a computer game published for several 8 - bit formats in 1986 by Piranha Games . It was written by Don Priestley and based on the British children 's television show of the same name . What entity does 'the trap door ' has the relation 'instance of' with?

If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary, it is known as a simple fruit, as seen in nuts and beans. An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel, but all are in the same flower: the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit, as seen in the raspberry. Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers. An example is the pineapple, where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit.

The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction and disappointment with several aspects, including the staff member's behavior, unresponsiveness to the reviewer's requests, haircut outcome, and overall customer service. The reviewer mentions that the person they went to appeared to be drunk from celebrating New Years, which sets the tone for their unfavorable experience and sheds a negative light on the establishment's professionalism. Additionally, the staff member did not listen to the reviewer's preferences and seemed to prioritize their own interests, further highlighting the poor customer service. Furthermore, the reviewer explicitly states their unhappiness with the hair-cut results, as the outcome was not what they had initially requested. Despite their dissatisfaction, they mention having paid for the service and even tipping, which demonstrates their graciousness but also emphasizes the gravity of the negative situation. In the final part of the review, the reviewer reiterates their discontent with both the establishment and customer service by labeling it as \\"awful.\\" Moreover, they declare that they will never return to the place, suggesting that the experience had a significant impact on their perception of the business. In summary, this review clearly conveys a predominantly negative sentiment as the customer details their dissatisfaction with various elements of their experience, including unprofessionalism, lack of attention and disregard for their wishes, and poor customer service."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. make music B. orchestra C. high school band D. symphony E. cricket stadium A:","completion":"The most suitable option to hear a bassoon played in a very pleasing fashion would be B. orchestra. An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble that typically includes the brass, string, woodwind, and percussion sections. Among the woodwind instruments, you will find the bassoon, which has its unique, deep, and warm sound. In an orchestra setting, the bassoon often plays both expressive melodies and supporting harmonic roles. Professional orchestras consist of highly-skilled musicians who have spent years honing their craft, allowing them to deliver high-quality performances with a focus on aesthetic and artistic value. While other options like C. high school band and D. symphony also involve the presence of bassoons and may offer enjoyable performances, they might not always showcase the instrument to its full potential or in as pleasing a manner as an orchestra can. High school bands can have varying skill levels, and the quality of performance may not be consistently high. Meanwhile, a symphony could be a great option too, as it is a specific type of orchestra that performs classical music. However, orchestras generally encompass symphony orchestras as well as other ensembles, making option B a more inclusive choice. Option A. make music is not a suitable or clear choice as it is not linked to any specific performance context or musical ensemble. Lastly, option E. cricket stadium is an unsuitable option as well, as the primary focus at a cricket stadium is sports, and music is not the main form of entertainment.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sir Ian Terence Botham, OBE (born 24 November 1955) is an English former cricketer and current cricket commentator. Widely regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders in cricket history, Botham represented England in both Test and One-Day International cricket. He played most of his first-class cricket for Somerset, and also for Worcestershire, Durham and Queensland. He was an aggressive right-handed batsman and, as a right arm fast-medium bowler, was noted for his swing bowling. Botham's third overseas tour was to India in February 1980. It was the fiftieth anniversary of India's entry into Test cricket and so England played a single commemorative Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Bombay. It turned into a personal triumph for Botham who became the first player in Test history to score a century and take ten wickets in the same match. England's wicketkeeper Bob Taylor held ten catches in the match, eight of them off Botham's bowling. India won the toss and decided to bat first but, with Botham taking six for 58, they were all out on day one for 242. England replied with 296, the highlight being Botham's 114 from just 144 balls; he began his innings with England in trouble at 57 for four. This quickly became 58 for five and Botham was joined by England's other match hero Taylor. England's first five batsmen had contributed just 51 to the total. Botham was often unfairly labelled a \\"big hitter\\" but in fact his style was very orthodox (i.e., he \\"played straight\\") and in this innings he scored 17 fours but, significantly, no sixes. Taylor provided dogged support and their sixth wicket partnership realised 171 runs. When Botham was out near the end of day two, the score was 229 for six and England reached 232 for six at close of play, still ten runs behind. On the third morning, Taylor led England past India's total and, with useful batting performances by the specialist bowlers, England totalled 296 to gain a first innings lead of 54. India's second innings was a disaster and they lost eight wickets by the close of play on the third day with only Kapil Dev offering any resistance. They were all out early on the fourth day for 149. Botham was the outstanding performer again, taking seven for 48 which gave him match figures of thirteen for 106. Geoffrey Boycott and Graham Gooch scored the necessary runs for England to win by ten wickets with a day to spare. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he have any other notable achievements?","completion":"Sir Ian Terence Botham indeed has numerous notable achievements in his illustrious cricketing career. In addition to the India tour feat mentioned previously, Botham's remarkable performances include his 1981 Ashes series heroics which are fondly remembered as \\"Botham's Ashes.\\" During this series, he single-handedly turned around games with his magnificent batting and bowling, leading England to a dramatic 3-1 series victory over their arch-rivals Australia. Another achievement worth mentioning is Botham's milestone of scoring over 5,000 runs and taking more than 300 wickets in Test cricket. Only a handful of players have managed to achieve this exceptional all-round record. In total, Botham took 383 Test wickets at an average of 28.40 and scored 5,200 runs at an average of 33.54 in his 102-match Test career. In one-day internationals (ODIs), he took 145 wickets and scored 2,113 runs from 116 appearances. Apart from his incredible cricketing accomplishments, Botham is also known for his charitable work, particularly his fundraising efforts for leukemia research. He has embarked on several long-distance charity walks, raising millions of pounds for various charitable causes. Sir Ian Botham was duly recognized for his services to cricket and charity when he was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1992 and was later knighted in 2007. Today, he continues to be involved in cricket as a commentator and analyst, further contributing to the sport that he has passionately served throughout his career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour. It was to be worn on the right wrist. The fact it had to be the right wrist was very important. Otherwise, the invention didn't work properly, or even worse, it produced results opposite to its intended effect. Each day, its mini-containers had to be re-filled with substances promoting positive processes in the body leading to the return of good mood. There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase.

Question: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels.

Background: Adolf Hitler (German: ['adolf 'hItla] ( listen); 20 April 1889 - 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria--then part of Austria-Hungary--and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. Context: In 1923 Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the \\"Beer Hall Putsch\\". The NSDAP used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini's \\"March on Rome\\" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (state commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria's de facto ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler. On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the Burgerbraukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff. Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup. Hitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide. He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason. His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924, and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the NSDAP. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison. While at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Some passages imply genocide. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office. Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported back to Austria. The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void. In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925. Question: Did he serve his entire sentence? Answer:","completion":"No, Adolf Hitler did not serve his entire sentence. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison on 1st April 1924 for high treason. However, due to the friendly treatment from the guards, and political pressure, he was pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court. He was released from jail on 20th December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. In total, including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison, rather than the full five-year sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The destroyers take positions over many of Earth's major cities, including New York, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles.

Whitmore (Bill Pullman) of the impending attack. The President immediately orders large-scale evacuations of the targeted U.S. cities, but the aliens attack with advanced directed energy weapons before the evacuations could be completed. The President, his young daughter, portions of his staff, Constance and the Levinsons narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as a destroyer lays waste to Washington D.C.On July 3, the United States conducts a coordinated counterattack; the movie follows the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, as they participate in an assault on the destroyer that has devastated the city of Los Angeles.

Just 1:18 into the game Randall Cobb managed to make a punt-return TD over 80 yards to give the Packers the lead. The Vikings managed just 1 first down before the Packers defense forced them into another punt, Aaron Rodgers & co. took advantage of it and the lead went up to 14. 1:18 before the end of the first quarter the Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell missed a 52-yd field goal. The second quarter started the way the first went with a Packers score, Mason Crosby connected on a 25-yd FG. No more scoring happened in this half, Tramon Williams successfully intercepted a pass by Ponder, making it only the second highlight that quarter. The Vikings were shut down by the Packers defense by managing not to score the whole first half. At the start of the third quarter Rodgers found Jordy Nelson for a 17-yd TD pass to push the lead to 24-0. Later on, Adrian Peterson scored a TD after a 3-yd run to give Minnesota the only points in the game. The rest of the way was a one-sided affair, with the Packers scoring another three touchdowns.

A new creative team emerged in 1950 when brilliant actor James Stewart teamed with the equally-brilliant director Anthony Mann to make a series of westerns that helped define that genre for the future. Until that time Stewart was mainly noted for an aw..aw..aw approach to family oriented comedies, dramas, and romances. Not that he wasn't already a multi-talented Hollywood star. One of his best screen performances ever and one of the best for anyone on celluloid was as Macaulay 'Mike' Connor, a sarcastic writer for a scandal rag in \\"The Philadelphia Story.\\" He had even done westerns before. His portrayal of gun shy yet expert shot Thomas Jefferson Destry Jr. in the comedy western \\"Destry Rides Again\\" helped make that film a classic. But to most movie goers he was the all-American boyscout type Mr. Smith or George Bailey. Seldom was there a dark side to any of the characters he played. Anthony Mann was associated with B flicks in the film noir mode. \\"Raw Deal,\\" \\"Side Street,\\" and \\"T-Men\\" caught the eye of James Stewart. So the two gifted men combined their resources to produce some of the greatest Hollywood westerns ever made. \\"Winchester '73\\" and \\"The Man from Laramie\\" were the best but the others were almost as effective. Mann became a successful director of A films as a result going on to direct what some critics believe to be the greatest western of them all Gary Cooper's \\"Man of the West.\\" Stewart became fabulously wealthy as a result of the partnership because he signed for part of the royalties in return for a fraction of the salary he was usually paid, a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on. Winchester '73 was also one of the first films, maybe the first, to tell a story from the standpoint of a traveling gun. Each owner is part of the tale being told and it all comes together in the exciting showdown at the end of the movie, which also holds a surprise for the viewer. Based on a story by Stuart Lake, the tale centers on revenge and the ownership of the Winchester '73. The year is 1876. Custer and his 7th cavalry have been annihilated by the Sioux and Cheyenne at Little Big Horn. The whites want revenge. The native Americans want their land and their way of life back. This conflict leads to a confrontation between native Americas led by Young Bull (young Rock Hudson showing his potential as an actor) and a small cavalry group pinned down in a canyon and joined by civilians Lin McAdam (Stewart), his partner and life-long pal High Spade ( the underrated actor Millard Mitchell), and a couple trying to find themselves, Steve Miller (Charles Drake) and Lola Manners (Shelley Winters), a soiled dove with a kind heart. Among the horse soldiers are newcomers Tony Curtis and James Best (late of the \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\"), whose part is cut short by a bullet. Wyatt Earp was in Dodge City in 1876. The movie has him as head marshal. The fine actor Will Geer (later of the Waltons) looks like an older Earp. In reality Wyatt was assistant Marshal in Dodge at the time just cutting his teeth on being a lawman. Lin McAdam wins the Winchester in a shooting contest, but has it taken from him not long afterward by outlaw Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) and his henchmen. McAdam and High Spade are after both Dutch Henry and the Winchester for the remainder of the movie. An even more sinister character emerges along the way, Waco Johnnie Dean, played as evil personified by Dan Duryea who threatens to steal the show from the other members of a stellar cast. The Winchester passes through several hands during the course of the film, each time the transfer is intense. One involves a gunrunner played to perfection by John McIntire. Other swaps are intermingled with the scenario above. All this plus the action keeps the viewer glued to the seat throughout the entire show. As noted above, the cast is first rate down to the smallest role. Look for other familiar faces in uncredited parts, including the future sheriff of \\"Bonanza\\" Ray Teal and B western reliable Panhandle Perkins (Guy Wilkerson).

However, there are minor notes on historical inaccuracies regarding Wyatt Earp's portrayal in the film.

Here is a goal: how to boost mood instantly How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of boosting your mood instantly, it is essential to focus on practical and effective strategies that are easy to implement. The primary goal is to shift your mental and emotional state quickly, transforming your mindset from negative or flat to positive and energized. Here are several strategies to help you achieve this goal: 1. Deep breathing exercises: Taking slow, deep breaths for a few minutes can help in calming your nerves, relaxing your mind, and promoting a feeling of happiness. Inhale deeply for a count of four seconds, hold your breath for four seconds, and then exhale for another four seconds. Repeat this process for two to three minutes to feel an immediate improvement in your mood. 2. Positive affirmations: Affirmations are powerful statements that help to reframe negative thoughts and beliefs. Choose a positive affirmation that resonates with you, such as \\"I am strong and capable,\\" or \\"I am deserving of happiness and success.\\" By repeating your affirmation aloud or internally, you can create an instant shift in your mindset. 3. Gratitude exercise: Make a list of three things that you are grateful for in your life. This simple activity can help bring your focus away from negative thoughts and elevate your mood by reminding you of the positive aspects of your life. 4. Listen to uplifting music: Music has a profound influence on our emotions. Choose a song or playlist that has a positive and uplifting vibe, and allow the music to shift your mood as you listen attentively. Singing or dancing along can also help boost your spirits further. 5. Social interaction: Reach out to a friend or family member who you know uplifts you. Sometimes just having a light conversation with someone you feel comfortable with can instantly boost your mood. 6. Aromatherapy: Smelling essential oils like lavender, citrus, or peppermint can evoke positive emotions through their pleasant aroma. Keep your preferred essential oil handy and use it when you feel the need for an instant mood boost. 7. Engage in physical activity: Exercise releases endorphins in the brain, which can help elevate your mood instantly. Even a short, brisk walk or a few minutes of stretching can have a significant impact on your emotional state. 8. Smile: Smiling tricks your brain into thinking that you are genuinely happy, as it activates the release of feel-good neurotransmitters, like serotonin, endorphins, and dopamine. Force yourself to smile and see how it can affect your emotions. 9. Visualization: Close your eyes and imagine a peaceful and tranquil place that brings you joy. Place yourself in this calming environment and focus on the positive emotions it evokes. This mental escape can help reset your mood and set a positive tone for the rest of your day. 10. Practice self-compassion: Remind yourself that it's okay to feel down or stressed occasionally and that everyone experiences these emotions. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would treat a loved one in a similar situation. By incorporating these strategies into your daily routine, you can effectively boost your mood instantly and create a more positive and resilient mindset. Remember, consistency is key in maintaining an uplifted state of mind, so try to engage in these mood-enhancing activities regularly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass.

The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk.

When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling.

It remains unclear if Mr Trump’s wall would supplement the existing barriers in urban areas along the 1,900 mile border, constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers in the mid-1990s, or simply replace it. Bloomberg’s Thomas Penny pointed out that Magal saw an increase of six per cent on Wednesday. Sharp rise in shares of Israeli border wall building companyhttps://t.co/e1JsEkt3an pic.twitter.com/HX4bweBa1l — Thomas Penny (@ThomasWPenny) November 9, 2016 “We would join forces with a major US defence company that has experience with such projects worldwide,” Magal CEO Saar Koursh told Bloomberg in August. “We’ve done it in the past and we would definitely want to do it.” The company had previously seen a surge in business with the rise in global anxieties over Isis amid the Syrian refugee crisis. USA: Donald Trump will build the BIGGEST anti-Mexico wall... apparently “The border business was down, but then came Isis and the Syrian conflict,” he said. “The world is changing and borders are coming back big-time.” Another sector apparently benefitting from Mr Trump’s election win is the private prison industry. Two companies, Corrections Corp and GEO Group, saw significant gains, recouping losses they suffered after the Department of Justice announced it would discontinue the use of federal private prisons. It is likely that a President Trump would reverse that decision. “Private prisons would likely be a clear winner under Trump,” analysts for Height Securities LLC wrote, “as his administration will likely rescind the DOJ’s contract phase-out and [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] capacity to house detainees will come under stress.” ||||| Guns stocks are tumbling and prison stocks are soaring after Donald Trump won the presidential election. Corrections Corp. of America CXW, -1.40% was the biggest percentage gainer listed on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, with shares closing up 43%. Shares of Geo Group GEO, -0.08% which has corrections and other facilities in North America and abroad, closed up 21%. The gain Wednesday marked the biggest one-day percentage gain for the company since June 2000. The Obama administration in August announced plans to phase out some private prison use, which potentially could be reversed in a Trump administration. By comparison, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.46% was 1% Wednesday, and it has gained 3.5% so far this week. Meanwhile, shares of gun maker Sturm, Ruger & Co. Inc. RGR, -1.78% closed down 14.5% . Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation US:SWHC shares closed down 15%. Gun sales ticked up after of President Obama’s elections on concerns that laws around gun control would become more restrictive, said Chris Krueger, senior research analyst at Lake Street Capital. Now he believes gun buyers are more confident that Trump will protect gun-carry laws, so they’re not rushing out to buy them, leading to a drop in the stock, he said. In California, voters passed a ballot measure that tightened gun-control laws in the state. Washington state residents voted to restrict access to firearms for people that have been deemed by a court to be a threat. Nevada residents voted to expand background checks for gun purchases. Krueger said these initiatives were somewhat expected, which is why the stocks don’t seem to be reacting much to them. Additionally, he said gun enthusiasts are bullied by the prospect of a pro-gun nominee appointed to the Supreme Court by Trump. “I think today it’s more about the presidential election than the gun-control initiatives,” Krueger said. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"An Israeli company that constructs walls, like the one around Gaza, has experienced a surge in share prices following the election of Donald Trump because of his promise to build a wall between the US and Mexico.

Typically, pre-event setup has 30 tables available ,. --Take stock of how much more space you will have available to accommodate your tables and utensils. If you have a huge house, estimate a cultural event like a hollywood arts convention. Answer:","completion":"Gather the utensils you will need. Remember to use the 5 basic utensils of a dinner knife, salad fork, dinner fork, and a teaspoon. These utensils are essential in providing a proper and functional place setting for your guests. Each utensil has a specific purpose, and arranging them correctly will not only make your table setting look more polished but also promote ease during the dining experience. Make sure you have enough sets of these utensils for all expected attendees. Before setting the table, ensure that each piece of silverware is clean and polished. This will create a positive first impression on your guests and demonstrate your attention to detail. Next, start with arranging the dinner plate at the center of each place setting. This will create a focal point for the rest of the silverware to be organized around. When placing the silverware, consider the order in which the courses will be served. It is customary to arrange the utensils in the order guests will use them, working from the outside in. For instance, if you start with a salad course, the salad fork should be placed on the outermost part of the settings. The dinner fork, which is used for the main course, should be placed to the left of the dinner plate. To the right of the plate, place the dinner knife, with its serrated edge facing the plate. If you are serving soup as part of the meal, add a soup spoon to the right of the dinner knife. For dessert, the dessert utensil can be placed above the dinner plate, parallel to the edge of the table with the handle pointing towards the right. If you plan to serve coffee or tea, prepare teaspoons and set them next to the dessert utensil or provide them at the time of serving the beverage. Finally, keep in mind the various types of silverware available, such as stainless steel or silver-plated, which may impact the overall aesthetic of your table settings. Choose the style that best complements the theme of your event and the existing tableware, such as plates, glasses, linens, and additional décor. This will ensure a cohesive and visually appealing presentation that will impress your guests and make your event memorable."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is difference between try and do?","completion":"While these two questions are seeking clarification on differences between terms, their subject matters are different. The first question focuses on differentiating between brownfield and greenfield projects, which are concepts related to development and construction. The second question aims to differentiate between \\"try\\" and \\"do,\\" which are verbs denoting action. Let's analyze and provide detailed answers to each question separately. 1. What is the difference between a brownfield project and greenfield projects? Brownfield and greenfield projects are distinct types of development projects, particularly in the context of real estate, construction, and infrastructure. Brownfield Projects: Brownfield projects refer to the redevelopment or modification of existing structures, sites, or facilities. These projects often involve revitalizing areas that have been previously developed, such as old buildings, abandoned factories, or contaminated sites. They aim to boost the efficiency and functionalities of the existing infrastructure or create new utility out of it. Brownfield projects can also pose certain challenges requiring additional considerations: - Environmental issues: Brownfield projects may necessitate extensive environmental clean-up, especially if the previous use left contamination behind. - Legal complexities: Various permits and regulatory approvals might be needed due to the prior use of the site. - Higher costs: Remediation and handling of pre-existing structures can lead to increased expenses. Greenfield Projects: Greenfield projects, on the other hand, involve new developments on previously unused or undeveloped lands, like an empty plot or an agricultural field. These projects start from scratch, providing complete freedom for designing and planning the new structure or facility according to specific requirements. Some advantages of greenfield projects include: - More creativity: Fewer constraints from previous developments allow architects and engineers to build according to modern design principles and optimize space usage. - Lower initial costs: Since there are no pre-existing structures to remove or remediate, the initial costs can be significantly lower compared to brownfield projects. - Minimal regulatory hurdles: Greenfield projects generally face fewer legal complexities and regulatory burdens. However, greenfield projects may also contribute to urban sprawl, loss of natural habitats, and depletion of agricultural lands. 2. What is the difference between \\"try\\" and \\"do\\"? \\"Try\\" and \\"do\\" are both verbs that describe action, though they convey different meanings and intentions: Try: \\"Try\\" refers to making an effort or attempt to perform a particular task or accomplish something without any guarantee of success. It implies that an individual is uncertain of the outcome or is faced with difficulties in carrying out the task. Some examples include: - \\"I will try to finish the report by tomorrow.\\" - \\"She tried to learn a new language.\\" In these examples, the verb \\"try\\" signals a willingness to put forth effort, but it does not ensure that the goal will be achieved. Do: Contrastingly, \\"do\\" refers to the act of performing, executing, or completing a task or action. It implies more certainty and determination in completing the action, without focusing on the possibility of difficulties or failures. Some examples include: - \\"I will do my homework after dinner.\\" - \\"She did her best in the competition.\\" In these examples, the verb \\"do\\" conveys a confident commitment to carrying out the task or giving one's best effort. In conclusion, while both questions focus on differentiating between related concepts, the first question discusses the difference between brownfield and greenfield projects in development, and the second question highlights the difference between \\"try\\" and \\"do\\" as verbs denoting action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A boy wearing a red shirt plays a video games.\\" if \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt.\\"?","completion":"No, it is not logically possible to conclude that \\"A boy wearing a red shirt plays a video games\\" from the statement \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt.\\" Understanding why requires looking into what conclusions can logically be drawn from any given statement. In logic, conclusion can only be derived if it is directly or indirectly implied in the premises or the initial statements. The premises or initial statements are conditions that justify the argument and eventually lead to the conclusion. In the statement \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt,\\" only the color of the shirt the boy is wearing is mentioned. This statement speaks nothing about what the boy is doing, i.e., whether he is playing video games or not, which is out of the context of the statement. And this statement also does not speak about him wearing a red shirt, the color of shirt mentioned is brown, not red. For the first statement to logically lead to the conclusion \\"A boy wearing a red shirt plays a video games,”, there should be several more premises added to bridge the gap. These could be something like: 1. \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt.\\" 2. \\"The boy decides to change his shirt.\\" 3. \\"The boy puts on a red shirt.\\" 4. \\"Whenever the boy wears a red shirt, he plays video games.\\" These additional premises allow us to link the initial statement to the desired conclusion logically. However, as it stands, simply from the statement \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt,\\" it is not possible to logically conclude that \\"A boy wearing a red shirt plays video games.\\" They are unrelated in color of shirt and action the boy is doing. In conclusion, from the phrase or statement, \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt.\\", we cannot determine any other information about what the boy might be doing, let alone if he might be playing video games. Also, we cannot from this statement infer anything about the boy wearing a red shirt as there's no link or association made here. Thus, the phrase, \\"A boy wearing a red shirt plays a video games.\\" cannot be logically or directly concluded or deduced from \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus.

Article: In modern society there is a great deal of argument about competition. Some value it highly, believing that it is responsible for social progress. Others say that competition is bad; that it sets one person against another; that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people. I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth depended on how well they performed at tennis and other skills. For them, playing well and winning are often life-and-death affairs . The development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten. However, while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed, others take an opposite attitude. In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the common players, they are strongly against competition. Most of them are young people who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society. Teaching these youngsters, I often observe in them a desire to fail. They seem to find failure by not trying to win or achieve success. By not trying, they always have an excuse: \\" I may have lost, but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try.\\" What is not usually accepted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost, that would mean a lot. Such a loss would be a measure of their worth. Clearly, this belief is the same as that of true competitors who try to prove themselves. Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-worth depends on how well one performs in the competition. Both are afraid of not being valued. We can discover a new meaning in competition only as this kind of fear begins to disappear. Question: What is the similar belief of the true competitors and those with a desire to fail?

Troy Aikman just destroyed new colleague Skip Bayless Skip Bayless is now Troy Aikman’s Fox Sports colleague, and the former Cowboys quarterback still hates his guts. Aikman eviscerated the network’s decision to hire Bayless, pay him more than 5 million a year and make him the face of FS1. “To say I’m disappointed in the hiring of Skip Bayless would be an enormous understatement,” Aikman told Sports Illustrated. “Clearly, [Fox Sports president of national networks] Jamie Horowitz and I have a difference of opinion when it comes to building a successful organization. I believe success is achieved by acquiring and developing talented, respected and credible individuals, none of which applies to Skip Bayless.” You would not find too many people this side of Stephen A. Smith who would disagree with Aikman’s assessment, but the Hall of Famer’s beef with Bayless is personal. The shock jock’s first push to fame came as a columnist in Dallas when he wrote a book on the 1990s Cowboys, which included an unsubstantiated suggestion that Aikman is gay. “I’m upset about it because it was made up and there was nothing accurate about anything that was insinuated,” Aikman told SI last year. “And he did it, as he does everything, just for attention.” Bayless’ new show, “Undisputed,” debuted Tuesday, though any details of the premiere now will be completely overshadowed by the network’s top football analyst destroying its new star. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Skip Bayless, a former sports columnist who had offended Troy Aikman in the past with unfounded claims, was hired by Fox Sports, and now Aikman is unhappy about it.

During the week leading up to the game, Bengals star wide receiver Chad Ochocinco said in an interview that he'll do a celebratory \\"Lambeau Leap\\" into the end zone seats if he scores in Sunday's game at Lambeau Field. The Packers started the contest with the ball, but could only manage to move the ball to mid field before they settled for a punt. The Bengals offense then took to the field at their own 37-yard line and after moving the ball into the Packers red zone, Carson Palmer managed to hit Laveranues Coles on a short 5-yard pass in the center of the end zone to take an early 7-0 lead. The Packers managed to match the Bengals drive though, by capping an 11-play, 80-yard drive with a 3-yard pass by Aaron Rodgers to Donald Driver along the right sideline of the end zone. The score was now tied a 7-7. The Bengals regained possession after the Packers touchdown, but on the first play of their corresponding drive Carson Palmer attempted a pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco along the right sideline, but Packers cornerback Charles Woodson stepped in front of Ochocinco and intercepted the attempted pass. Woodson then returned the ball down to the Bengals 11-yard line for a return of 22 yards. Two plays later, Packers running back Ryan Grant scored a touchdown on a 4-yard run outside of the left guard to take a 14-7 lead. After the Grant touchdown, both teams exchanged possessions into the second quarter. On the Bengals second drive after the Ryan Grant touchdown run, quarterback Carson Palmer capped the Bengals drive with a 1-yard sneak up the middle for a touchdown to re-tie the contest at 14-14. The Packers offense again sputtered and couldn't find the rhythm that the offense once possessed a season ago. After the punt, Carson Palmer was sacked for a loss of 8 yards and then on the next play Charles Woodson intercepted another pass along the right sideline from Palmer and returned the ball 37 yards for the Packers first defensive score of the season to retake the lead 21-14.

The teams went into the half tied at 21. After the half, the Bengals offense took to the field first but was forced to punt. The Packers responded by moving the ball quite efficiently, but their drive came to an end when Ryan Grant fumbled after pulling in a short Aaron Rodgers pass. The Bengals then managed to capitalize on the Packers first turn over of the season by putting together a 12-play, 62-yard drive capped by another Carson Palmer touchdown pass, this time to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. After the touchdown, Ochocinco ran behind the endzone looking for a place to Lambeau Leap finally settling for a group of Bengals fans in the right corner of the endzone. Both teams exchanged possession without scoring through the end of the third quarter. With both teams unable to score into the fourth quarter, the Bengals finally converted a field goal with 2 minutes left in game. to take a 31-21 lead. After the field goal, the Packers took over and managed to get the ball into field goal range in which Packers coach decided to kick the field goal to decrease the lead to 7 needing an onside kick recovery to tie the game anyway.

Mason Crosby kicked the ball the right side and the ball hopped right to Packers corner back Tramon Williams for the recovery. With 45 seconds remaining, The Packers offense took the field with no timeouts. Rodgers then completed a couple of passes and moved the ball past midfield with 16 seconds remaining.

Hurrying down field the Packers snapped the ball with 1 second remaining but the Packers were flagged for a false start. With the penalty the remaining time was run off the clock and the game ended. What could have been a memorable comeback ended in defeat with the Packers suffering their first loss of the season 31-24 to bring their record to 1-1. This was the first time the Packers had lost to the Bengals at home.

Article: For years and years people have been saying that the rail ways are dead. \\"We can do without railways\\", people say as if motorcars and planes have made the railways unnecessary. We all keep hearing that trains are slow, that they lose money, and that they're dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, the railways have become highly competitive with motorcars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't leave you as a plane does, miles and miles from the city center. It doesn't hold you up as a car does, in endless traffic jams. And a single train can carry goods which no plane or motorcar could ever do. Far from being dead, the railways are very much alive. Modern railway lines give you a smooth, untroubled journey. Where else can you eat well, sleep in comfort, feel safe and enjoy the scene while you are traveling at speed at the same time? And we are only at the beginning,for we have just entered the age of _ . Trains are traveling at 150 miles an hour and more.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award?, using the article: In June 1965, Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971 the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be. The minor planet 4149 Harrison, discovered in 1984, was named after him, as was a variety of Dahlia flower. In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrison's \\"critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of world music\\" and for his having \\"advanced society's comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music\\". Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\".In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Eric Clapton organised the event, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle, who described Harrison as \\"one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced\\", was among the performers of Monty Python's \\"Lumberjack Song\\". The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.In 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra.A documentary film entitled George Harrison: Living in the..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award is \\"George\\". This person is George Harrison, notable as a member of the Beatles who received recognition for their musical contributions with an appointment as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1965. Harrison continued to carve his legacy in the music industry as reflected by his various achievements over the years. His contributions went beyond the Beatles, as Harrison also pursued successful endeavours in his solo career and collaborations with other artists. These are evident in receiving an Academy Award for the Best Original Song Score in 1971 for the film Let It Be, as well as recognitions extended after his passing, such as his posthumous induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. However, the accolade in question, the Billboard Century Award, was received by Harrison in December 1992. This award honours music artists for their significant bodies of work and in Harrison's case, it recognized how integral he was to shaping the modern concept of world music and demonstrating how popular music can embody spirituality and altruism.

Асфальт является одним из основных материалов, используемых для строительства и ремонта дорог, аэродромов, тротуаров и других дорожных покрытий. Он может производиться и использоваться в различных видах и составах, которые могут быть разделены на следующие основные категории: 1. Горячий асфальт (тонкозернистый и крупнозернистый) - эта разновидность асфальта производится путем смешивания битума с песком и мелким гравием или крупным щебнем. Эти компоненты нагреваются для получения горячей смеси, которая затем укладывается машинами и трамбуется для формирования плотного асфальтированного покрытия. 2. Холодный асфальт - этот вид асфальта изготавливается без нагрева компонентов до высоких температур. Здесь используются специальные добавки или модифицированные виды битума, которые позволяют смешивать и укладывать асфальтную смесь при более низких температурах. Холодный асфальт обычно применяется для быстрого ремонта повреждений дорожного покрытия, таких как ямы и трещины. 3. Черный щебень - это основной компонент многих асфальтовых смесей, который обеспечивает прочность и структуру дорожного покрытия. Черный щебень - это щебень, который получается при дроблении скальных пород и камней, таких как базальт, гранит, диабаз или долерит. Он используется в разных фракциях, и его качество тщательно контролируется для обеспечения нужных характеристик асфальтовых смесей.

A gunshot to the head often results in immediate death due to the critical damage inflicted on the brain, which is the control center of the body. The brain is responsible for all bodily functions including heartbeat, breathing, consciousness, and movement.

Keep training sessions short. Start training your dog immediately.\\"","completion":"Title: Training Your Dog: Patience, Rewards, and Effectiveness Introduction: Training a dog requires patience, consistency, and a commitment to effectively communicate with your furry friend. When done correctly, dog training not only cultivates a strong bond between owners and their pets, but it also ensures a well-behaved and disciplined companion. In this article, we will discuss four key principles of dog training: being patient, rewarding good behavior, keeping training sessions short, and starting training as soon as possible. 1. Be Patient: Training a dog is a gradual process that requires understanding, compassion, and tolerance. Dogs, like humans, learn at different paces and may need more or less time to grasp a concept or a command. Patience is essential because it helps to create a positive and stress-free learning environment, where the dog feels safe and encouraged to grow and learn new skills. Frustration, anger, or impatience might hinder the training process and can even create negative associations for the dog. Be patient and recognize that progress may be slow, but each step forward is a significant achievement. 2. Reward Good Behavior: Dogs respond well to positive reinforcement; the use of praise, treats, or warm affection can motivate them to perform a specific action. Rewarding good behavior is crucial because it helps the dog associate the action with a positive outcome. The more frequently the dog is rewarded for good behavior, the more likely it is to become a habit. This encourages the development of desirable behaviors while concurrently discouraging undesired actions. Be consistent in rewarding your dog and choose rewards that hold a high value for your pet, such as a favorite treat or toy. 3. Keep Training Sessions Short: Dogs have limited attention spans, and it is important to keep training sessions short and exciting to maintain their focus and interest. Experts recommend that training sessions should not exceed 15 minutes, especially for younger dogs, since their concentration may diminish over extended periods. Conducting multiple short sessions throughout the day is more beneficial than longer, less frequent sessions. This allows the dog to absorb and practice the new skills without becoming overwhelmed or fatigued. 4. Start Training Immediately: The sooner you begin training your dog, the easier and more effective the process will be. Puppies are more receptive to learning new commands and concepts, whereas older dogs may have developed habits that are more difficult to modify. This does not mean that older dogs are untrainable; it simply means that the process may take more time and effort. In either case, starting your dog's training as soon as you bring them home is vital for fostering good behavior and establishing clear expectations. Conclusion: Dog training is a rewarding and fulfilling aspect of the bond between pet and owner. Focusing on patience, rewarding good behavior, keeping training sessions short, and starting training as early as possible can significantly improve the process for both the dog and the trainer. Remember that consistency is key, and that every step forward in your dog's training journey is a testament to the loving and nurturing partnership you share."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There may be other constitutional provisions that come into play, or there may be other existing -- Can we draw the following conclusion? Congress has the power to write laws","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Congress has the power to write laws based on the given statement and further understanding of the United States Constitution. The statement mentions that it is a grant of power to Congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial. This grant of power refers to the authority given to the United States Congress in the U.S Constitution. As Congress is the legislative branch of the federal government of the United States, it is primarily responsible for making laws. To better understand this, it is essential to look at the history and structure of the U.S. Constitution. Established in 1787, the Constitution provides both a framework and guiding principles for the functioning of a democratic government in the United States. The Constitution separates the powers of the federal government into three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Article I of the U.S. Constitution describes the authority and power granted to Congress. It states that the legislative power, which is the power to create laws, shall be vested in a bicameral legislature consisting of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Together, these two houses are responsible for writing, debating, and ultimately passing bills, which, when signed by the President or passed over a presidential veto, become federal laws. The primary purpose of having a bicameral Congress is to ensure that all perspectives are considered, and the interests of the states, as well as their constituents, are represented both at a local and national level. This process also involves several checks and balances that are crucial to maintaining the stability of the federal government and preventing the abuse of power by a single entity or individual. Moreover, the United States Congress operates within a broader constitutional framework, which includes safeguards to protect citizens' fundamental rights and liberties, as well as accountability and oversight mechanisms to ensure that laws are consistent with the Constitution. While Congress is granted wide latitude to write laws, they must uphold and respect the Constitution's rights, principles, and limitations, as enforced by the executive and judicial branches. In conclusion, yes, Congress has the power to write laws based on the authority granted to them by the United States Constitution. Legislating is a fundamental function of the legislative branch and is essential for maintaining a well-functioning democratic government. However, this power must be exercised within the wider context of the U.S. Constitution to ensure that all laws adhere to the principles of democracy, fairness, and the protection of individual rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 08:25 EST, 10 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 15:31 EST, 12 October 2012. Enraged: Robert Zimmerman Jr., pictured on Piers Morgan Tonight, launched a threatening Twitter tirade at the the Trayvon Martin family's attorneys. The older brother of George Zimmerman has launched a Twitter tirade on an attorney for Trayvon Martin's family, vowing to make it his life's work to disbar her. Robert Zimmerman Jr.'s rant followed a week of television interviews in which he protested the innocence of his brother, who stands accused of killing the unarmed teenager in February. The Zimmermans have been on a national media crusade over the past week - chatting with Piers Morgan and Spanish-speaking channels - to 'reintroduce' the family, who believe they have been misrepresented throughout the high-profile, divisive case. On Monday, Robert Zimmerman Jr. marked the end of his press tour by unleashing his anger at attorney Natalie Jackson, blaming her for the false portrayal of his family. 'I hope GOD grants you a long life so. you live to repent for what you have done,' he wrote on a tweet to her on Monday. He went on: 'My Life’s work = you WILL be held accountable for your words/actions. You AINT seen NOTHIN' yet... I will see U disbarred.' And, in a reference to what critics have dubbed the 'scheme team' behind the case - attorneys Jackson and Benjamin Crump and Orlando publicist Ryan Julison - he added: 'The Scheme will be exposed, one by one, day by day - SHAME on you.' Jackson quipped back: 'Please see my Rule #1: Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference - Mark Twain.' Scroll down for video. Anger: Zimmerman, the brother of George Zimmerman, directed messages at attorney Natalie Jackson. His emotional outburst underscores the trouble the family has faced controlling their image, and the struggle the defense team endures to keep their client and his family in line. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara told the Miami Herald that he. cringed when he saw the rant and that the media tour had gone ahead without George Zimmerman's knowledge. In their attempts to support their relative, the Zimmermans may be doing more harm than good, he suggested. 'I have been cautious with how we act in. this case and now someone with the same last name who does not act with. the same constraints is out there - and I have no control over him,' O'Mara said. Target: Natalie Jackson (centre) is representing the Martins with Daryl Parks (left) and Ben Crump (left) It is just another debacle for the defense team. They faced an early struggle after nationwide protests called for the arrest of Zimmerman, who they claimed attacked 17-year-old Trayvon because he was African American. After Zimmerman was released from prison after bailing himself out, he ended up back behind bars and on a new bail after the courts accused him about failing to reveal the extent of his legal funds. Then, last month, Zimmerman's best friend published a book full of errors about how Trayvon died - but ended up on the prosecution's evidence list, the Herald reported. Robert Zimmerman Jr., 31, decided to stand up for his family - who have all gone into hiding since the case arose - and travelled to Los Angeles last week to carry out interviews. Case: Neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, left, has been charged with second-degree murder for the February shooting of Trayvon Marton, right. He shot the teenager as he walked home. Family support: Robert Jr. has appeared on a number of TV and radio shows this week to speak against the portrayal of his brother and his family by the media. His aim, he said in an email to. reporters, was to 'reintroduce the Zimmerman family' and he was the only. person authorized to speak on their behalf. He went on to appear on radio and television shows in Los Angeles, where he painted his brother as a hard-working man attacked by the teenager and demonised by the media. He also appeared on Piers Morgan Tonight with his mother, who had her face obscured, before taking to his Twitter account for the attack on the Martin lawyer. In an email to the Herald, he stood by his rant, saying: 'I. don't want her to be able to use her position as an attorney to. assassinate anyone else's character or to ever hurt anyone else's. family.' Fight: Attorneys for Zimmerman said the Twitter rant will not have helped their already troubled case. Here, supporters of Trayvon Martin hold a rally in March, calling for Zimmerman's arrest. His brother, 29, has been charged with second-degree murder for the February 26 shooting in Sanford, Florida. Trayvon was found to be just carrying Skittles and iced tea when he was killed, but Zimmerman's attorneys claim he acted in self defense when the teenager tackled him. The team has requested that Trayvon's school records and social media posts be released as part of the trial. A hearing for the request will be heard on October 19.

If we are wise, we accept these failures as a necessary part of the learning process. But all too often we convey to our children either by words or by actions that failure is something to be ashamed of, that nothing but top performance meets our approval. Donnie was my youngest third-grader. His fear of failure kept him from classroom games that other children played excitedly. He seldom answered questions - he might be wrong. He seldom finished his work because he repeatedly checked with me to be sure he hadn't made a mistake. I tried my best to build his self-confidence. But nothing changed until midterm, when Mary Anne, a student teacher, was assigned to our classroom. She was young and pretty, and she loved children. My pupils, Donnie included, adored her. But even enthusiastic, loving Mary was _ by this little boy who feared he might make a mistake. Then one morning we were working math problems. Donnie had copied the problems with painstaking neatness and filled in answers for the first row. Pleased with his progress, I left the children with Mary. But when I returned, Donnie was in tears. He'd missed the third problem. Mary looked at me in despair. Suddenly her face brightened. From the desk we shared, she got a canister filled with pencils. \\"Look, Donnie,\\" she said, \\"I've got something to show you.\\" She removed the pencils and placed them on his desk. \\"See these pencils, Donnie?\\" she continued. \\"They belong to Mrs. Lindstrom and me.

Q: Abstract: Nervous system function requires proper development of two functional and morphological domains of neurons, axons and dendrites. Although both these domains are equally important for signal transmission, our understanding of dendrite development remains relatively poor. Here, we show that in C. elegans the Wnt ligand, LIN-44, and its Frizzled receptor, LIN-17, regulate dendrite development of the PQR oxygen sensory neuron. In lin-44 and lin-17 mutants, PQR dendrites fail to form, display stunted growth, or are misrouted. Manipulation of temporal and spatial expression of LIN-44, combined with cell-ablation experiments, indicates that this molecule is patterned during embryogenesis and acts as an attractive cue to define the site from which the dendrite emerges. Genetic interaction between lin-44 and lin-17 suggests that the LIN-44 signal is transmitted through the LIN-17 receptor, which acts cell autonomously in PQR. Furthermore, we provide evidence that LIN-17 interacts with another Wnt molecule, EGL-20, and functions in parallel to MIG-1/Frizzled in this process. Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for Wnt and Frizzled molecules in regulating dendrite development in vivo..

What is the solution?","completion":"In order to solve the given equation, -240*n + 302 - 62 = 0, for n, you will need to follow a process of rearranging and simplifying the equation to isolate n. Here's the step-by-step solution: Step 1: Combine like terms Combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation. -240*n + (302 - 62) = 0 -240*n + 240 = 0 Step 2: Isolate n To isolate n, you will need to move the constant term (240) to the other side of the equation. You can do this by adding or subtracting the term from both sides of the equation. In this case, you will subtract 240 from both sides. -240*n + 240 - 240 = 0 - 240 -240*n = -240 Step 3: Solve for n Now that you have isolated n, you will need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n, which is -240 in this case. (-240*n) / (-240) = (-240) / (-240) n = 1 So the solution for the equation -240*n + 302 - 62 = 0 is n = 1."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Pick one category for the following text.

It is a neutral term that refers to a name or a place. To determine whether it is considered positive or negative, one would need to have more context to understand the specific reference and associations tied to it. \\"Katzenberg\\" can refer to two different contexts: 1. Jeffrey Katzenberg: A prominent figure in the entertainment industry, Jeffrey Katzenberg is an American film producer and media entrepreneur. He is best known as the co-founder of DreamWorks Animation, which gave us blockbuster movies like \\"Shrek,\\" \\"Kung Fu Panda,\\" and \\"How to Train Your Dragon.\\" He has also previously worked as a chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Depending on an individual's opinion or perspective on his work or contributions to the entertainment industry, the name \\"Katzenberg\\" might be considered positive or negative. For instance, if someone appreciates his work in the animation field, they may associate the name with positive connotations such as creativity and success. On the other hand, someone who dislikes his work may associate the name with negative connotations such as over-commercialization or particular business practices. 2. Katzenberg, Germany: Katzenberg is a small hill located in the town of Kinding in Germany. It is known for its scenic views, hiking trails, and recreational facilities. For those who enjoy nature and outdoor activities, the name \\"Katzenberg\\" might have positive connotations, representing a place that offers an escape from urban life and the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of nature. In contrast, for someone not interested in such activities or who has no particular attachment or association to the location, the name \\"Katzenberg\\" may be neutral or not hold any significance.

Q:Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows.

Given the question: Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection, and evolution is a sequence of variation and selection. Given these facts, what produces variation among the following options: - animals - evolution - pollen - environment - a doorbell - movement - seasons - competition The answer is:","completion":"To identify the correct answer, let's go through the options step by step. 1. Animals: Although animals display variation, they don't produce variation on their own. They only express the genetic differences already present. 2. Evolution: Evolution is the overall process that leads to variation and selection, but it is not the direct cause or producer of variation. 3. Pollen: Pollen plays a role in plant reproduction, leading to genetic variation by allowing the fusion of sperm and egg cells in different plants. However, it does not contribute to variation in other forms of life. 4. Environment: The environment does not produce variation directly but acts as a selection force in the process of evolution. It influences which variations are more suited for survival and reproduction. 5. A doorbell: A doorbell is unrelated to the production of variation. It's an inanimate human-made object with no impact on biological variation. 6. Movement: Movement can contribute to creating new gene combinations when organisms relocate or migrate to different areas. However, it is not the primary producer of variation, just an indirect influencer. 7. Seasons: Like environment, seasons can act as a selection force by influencing survival and reproduction rates of organisms. However, they do not directly produce variation. 8. Competition: Competition acts as a selection force, favoring traits that help organisms survive and reproduce in an environment where resources are limited, but it doesn't generate variation itself. None of the options listed is the direct producer of variation. Variation mostly originates from genetic mutations and sexual reproduction (recombination). However, the closest answer among the given options is \\"pollen,\\" as it contributes to variation through plant reproduction, leading to genetic diversity across subsequent generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others...

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold.

Director Richard Linklater has wisely stayed with the structure of the 1976 classic (with Walter Matthau in the Butterworth role) but populated it with dialogue from Bad Santa's Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. 2. Thornton [knocks] every one-liner out of the park with the free rein Linklater allows him, though a picked-up pace would've been welcome. 3. Having cast a knowing eye on teen debauchery in Dazed and Confused and coaxed a stellar performance out of Jack Black in School of Rock, the director is just the man to launch a surprise spitwad attack in the current culture wars. 4. If you're looking for another Adam Sandler/Jack Black comic masterpiece, this isn't it. It is, though, Billy Bob Thornton at his best, dropping analogies that would make a Hooters waitress blush. 5. Even if you never saw the original Bad News Bears, you've probably seen this movie. You know, the one where the reluctant coach pulls together the ragtag bunch of misfits and teaches them important lessons about teamwork. 6. Linklater's spirit is true: Practice still unfolds to the waltz of Carmen. Sentiment is avoided at all costs. 7. The best reason to see Richard Linklater's wholly unnecessary but highly enjoyable remake of The Bad News Bears is Billy Bob Thornton, who's doing a PG-13 version of his Bad Santa. 8. Fortunately almost everyone acquits himself coolly and admirably. 9. Billy Bob Thornton has proven he can do pretty much anything, but he simply does not look haggard, washed-up or miserable enough to be a believable Morris Buttermaker, the role Walter Matthau immortalized. 10. It's no Bad Santa, but it's fun. What is a brief summary of the following reviews?","completion":"The reviews praise Richard Linklater's adaptation of the 1976 classic Bad News Bears, with its fresh dialogue and his directing expertise from previous films such as Dazed and Confused and School of Rock. The film is highlighted as not being like typical Adam Sandler/Jack Black comedies but showcases Billy Bob Thornton at his best, providing memorable one-liners. Although some pacing issues and a somewhat familiar storyline are mentioned, the movie is considered enjoyable for its true spirit and avoidance of sentimentality. Thornton's performance is noted as the main draw to the film. Overall, the film is entertaining and worth watching despite not reaching the same level as Bad Santa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: Q: How many neutrons do 99% of carbon atoms have? A: A:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to determine the number of neutrons typically found in a carbon atom. Step 1: Identify the most common isotope of carbon. Carbon has several isotopes, but the most common and stable one is carbon-12, which accounts for about 99% of all carbon on Earth. Step 2: Determine the atomic number and mass number of carbon-12. The atomic number of carbon is 6, meaning it has 6 protons. Carbon-12 has a mass number of 12 (hence its name), which is the combined number of protons and neutrons. Step 3: Calculate the number of neutrons in carbon-12. Since the mass number of carbon-12 is the sum of its protons and neutrons, we can find the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number. Neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number Neutrons = 12 - 6 The calculation gives us 6 neutrons for 99% of carbon atoms. A: d). six."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

He didn't know how long the bodies had been there before being found, and he wouldn't say if any weapons were found at the scene. \\"Unfortunately, it's horrible, terrible, sad ... especially at this time of year,\\" he said. The deaths happened in the city's Lansingburgh neighborhood, which runs along the Hudson River overlooking the housing developments that have risen in Cohoes. Residents said the neighborhood is mostly quiet. Shakeria Jones, who lives around the corner, believes the victim could be her friend. \\"She lives in the basement apartment,\\" said Jones. \\"I've been calling her all day.

I joined Tinder. Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - A police officer, also known as a policewoman, policeman, police agent is a warranted law employee of a police force. In the United States, \\"officer\\" usually is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, \\"officer\\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often \\"constable\\". In some nations the use of the rank \\"officer\\" is legally reserved for military personnel. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary citizens. - Special police (also see Auxiliary police) usually describes a police force or unit within a police force whose duties and responsibilities are significantly different from other forces in the same country or from other police in the same force, although there is no consistent international definition. A special constable, in most cases, is not a member of a special police force; in countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and often elsewhere, a special constable is a voluntary or part-time member of a national or local police force or a person involved in law enforcement who is not a police officer but has some of the powers of a police officer. - Concurrent jurisdiction exists where two or more courts from different systems simultaneously have jurisdiction over a specific case. This situation leads to forum shopping, as parties will try to have their civil or criminal case heard in the court that they perceive will be most favorable to them. - Community Safety Accreditation Schemes are a means by which the Chief Constable of a police force in the United Kingdom may grant a limited range of police powers to employees of non-police organisations who contribute towards community safety. Community Safety Accreditation Schemes were created under section 40 of the Police Reform Act 2002. Individuals who have been granted these powers are known under the Act as Accredited Persons. - In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes. These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole and probation. A typical \\"correctional institution\\" is a prison. A \\"correctional system\\", also known as a \\"penal system\\", thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and community-based programs like parole and probation boards;. This system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts. Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly-named agencies. - Michele Marie Leonhart ( born February 27 , 1956 ) is an American career law enforcement officer and the former Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . After the resignation of Administrator Karen P. Tandy in the fall of 2007 , Leonhart also served as Acting Administrator of the DEA . On February 2 , 2010 , President Barack Obama nominated Leonhart for the position of DEA Administrator . Leonhart 's tenure as DEA Administrator was marked with controversy and scandals including a prostitution scandal ; by the end of her service in April 2015 , she was labelled \`\` embattled '' when a bipartisan group of lawmakers declared that they had no confidence in her leadership . On April 21 , she conveyed to Attorney General Eric Holder that she intended to resign the following month . - In the United States, a special agent is usually a detective or investigator for a state, county, municipal, federal, or tribal government who primarily serve in investigatory roles. Within the United States' federal law enforcement system, dozens of federal agencies employ federal law enforcement officers, each with different criteria pertaining to the use of the titles \\"\\"Special Agent\\"\\" versus \\"\\"Agent\\"\\". In intelligence usage, agent refers to one who is recruited, trained, controlled and employed to obtain and report information. - The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is the statute establishing federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. It was passed by the 91st United States Congress as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States. The DEA is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security, and the U.S. Border Patrol. It has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations both domestic, and abroad. - The role of Immigration officers is to ensure that immigration legislation is enforced. This can cover the rules of entry for visa applicants, foreign nationals or those seeking asylum at the border, detecting and apprehending those that have breached the border and removing them, or pursuing those in breach of immigration and criminal laws. - Parole officers and probation officers play a role in the criminal justice systems by supervising offenders released from incarceration or sentenced to non-custodial sanctions such as community service. In some jurisdictions parole or probation officers are involved in presenting reports on offenders and making sentencing recommendation to courts of law. - Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to serve as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004. - Homeland security is an American umbrella term for \\"the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive to the national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and minimize the damage from attacks that do occur.\\" - The Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States, which simultaneously serves as the nation's prime federal law enforcement agency. Operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI is concurrently a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. A leading U.S. counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes. - A law enforcement officer (LEO) or peace officer, in North American English, is a public-sector employee whose duties primarily involve the enforcement of laws. The phrase can include police officers, municipal law enforcement officers, special police officers, customs officers, state troopers, special agents, special investigators, border patrol officers, immigration officers, court officers, probation officers, parole officers, arson investigators, auxiliary officers, game wardens, sheriffs, corrections, marshals, and deputies. Security guards are civilians and therefore not law enforcement officers, unless they have been granted powers to enforce particular laws, such as those accredited under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme. Although typically the term \\"law enforcement officer\\" refers to those government agents with police powers, prosecutors are also law enforcement officers. - A sheriff is a government official, with varying duties, existing in some countries with historical ties to England, where the office originated. There is an analogous although independently developed office in Iceland that is commonly translated to English as \\"sheriff,\\" and this is discussed below. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - An officer is a person who has a position of authority in a hierarchical organization. - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.

Step 2: Evaluate each option a) three: This option fits the sentence, discussing the reduction factor by three to five. b) eight: This option increases the range too much, as it changes the factor range to eight to five which doesn't make sense. c) four: Filling in \\"four\\" would limit the range only to four to five which doesn't represent a significant enough difference in range. d) ten: This option increases the range too much, as it changes the factor range to ten to five which doesn't make sense. Step 3: Choose the best answer Option a) \\"three\\" seems to be the best fit for the sentence, as it creates an appropriate range (three to five) for the reduction factor while the other options either distort the range or don't emphasize a significant difference."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

To come up with this answer, I first used my knowledge of the languages involved, Portuguese and Farsi. I understood the given sentence in Portuguese, which states \\"Terceiro, eles estão frequentemente a criar mercados\\" - meaning, \\"Third, they are often creating markets.\\" Next, I broke down the sentence into individual words and phrases before translating each of them into Farsi. \\"Terceiro\\" means \\"third\\" in Portuguese, which translates to \\"سوم\\" in Farsi. \\"Eles estão\\" is equivalent to \\"they are\\" in English, and its Farsi translation is \\"آنها دارند.\\" \\"Frequentemente\\" means \\"often\\" and translates to \\"معمولاً\\" in Farsi. \\"A criar\\" means \\"creating\\" in Portuguese; it can be translated to \\"ایجاد می‌کنند\\" in Farsi. Lastly, \\"mercados\\" translates to \\"بازارهای\\" in Farsi, meaning \\"markets.\\" By putting all these translations together, I arrived at the Farsi sentence: سوم، آنها معمولاً دارند بازارهای جدید ایجاد می‌کنند, which means \\"Third, they are often creating markets\\" - an accurate translation of the original Portuguese sentence."},{"prompt":"A question is presented to you in this task, and your job is to write a potentially correct answer.

Context: In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea (£1.05 in present British currency) per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Private recitals cost more than piano lessons.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" I am facing a new situation today: Tom and Jerry are two friends who have always had competitions with one another throughout their whole lives. Yesterday, they just finished their most unique competition so far. Each man was given a room to sit in that had several highly radioactive objects in it. The challenge was to see who would stay in the chamber longer. Tom didn't stay in his room for very long, but Jerry felt determined to win and stayed in his chamber almost the entire day. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which man is more likely to go bald sooner? A:","completion":"Based on the background article and the situation you presented, Jerry, who stayed in his chamber with highly radioactive objects for almost the entire day, is more likely to go bald sooner. Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause damage to living tissue and result in various health issues, including hair loss. As stated in the background article, high doses of ionizing radiation can lead to Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), which may cause symptoms such as skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and death. Jerry's prolonged exposure to the radioactive objects puts him at a higher risk of experiencing these negative effects, including hair loss or baldness, compared to Tom who stayed in his room for a shorter period. However, it's important to note that calculating the exact risk and chance of these health issues happening, such as hair loss, is not well understood and may depend on factors like the level of radiation exposure and individual susceptibility. Additionally, without knowing the exact levels of the radiation in each room, we can't provide a precise estimation of the risks they faced. Nevertheless, based on the information given, Jerry is likely to face greater risks, including going bald sooner, due to his longer exposure to the radioactive environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: -- negative -- positive Short movie review: i just did n't care Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the short movie review provided, it is apparent that the critic is thinking negatively about the movie. The statement \\"I just didn't care\\" signifies that the movie failed to capture the critic's interest or evoke any emotional response from them. When a critic has a positive view of a movie, they typically express appreciation for various aspects such as the plot, performances, direction, cinematography, or other notable elements. They would highlight the aspects that resonated with them and made a lasting impression. Positive reviews would contain words and phrases like \\"impressive,\\" \\"well-crafted,\\" \\"excellent performance,\\" and \\"compelling.\\" On the other hand, a negative review, like the one provided, often suggests a lack of impact or investment in the film. The critic is likely disappointed or underwhelmed by the movie. As a result, they might use language that reflects their dissatisfaction or indifference. Expressions like \\"didn't care,\\" \\"forgettable,\\" \\"mediocre,\\" or \\"uninspired\\" can be indicative of negative opinions about a film. In this case, the critic simply saying \\"I just didn't care\\" reveals a negative opinion since they are not highlighting any positive aspects nor showing any enthusiasm about the film. They neither felt connected to the movie nor found it significant enough to garner their interest or emotional involvement, which reflects an unfavorable assessment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the navigator for whose medical lapses Ambler felt the probable cause was syphilis? Answer the above question based on the context below: In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed \\"chief scientist,\\" he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize.

Mr. Speaker, Robert Kennedy once said each time a person stands up for an ideal, strikes out against injustice, they send forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of resistance. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Robert kennedy felt that unilateral action was effective .","completion":"Based on the given paragraph by Robert Kennedy, it is possible to infer that he believed in the power of individual actions and their capacity to create significant change. However, it is important to consider the context and nuances of his statement to determine whether it entirely supports the notion that \\"Robert Kennedy felt that unilateral action was effective.\\" The quote itself emphasizes the value of individuals taking a stand and acting in the face of injustice. Kennedy's words illustrate the idea that although a single action may seem insufficient or negligible, collectively, they have the potential to bring about substantial change in society. In this sense, Kennedy appears to be advocating for the importance of individual action in tackling societal issues and promoting justice. However, the statement that Kennedy felt unilateral action was effective can be seen as an oversimplification of his beliefs. Unilateral action broadly refers to decisions or actions taken by a single individual, group, or nation without the agreement or cooperation of others. While Kennedy's quote does acknowledge the importance of individual actions, it does not dismiss the significance of collaboration and solidarity. The mention of ripples crossing \\"from a million different centers of energy\\" indicates that Kennedy believed change and progress were not solely the result of solitary efforts. He recognized the need for diverse individuals to come together, contributing their individual energies and efforts to a collective movement. In this way, it can be argued that Kennedy's statement speaks more to the power of the collective than to unilateralism. To conclude, while Robert Kennedy's quote does emphasize the importance and potential impact of individual actions, it also highlights the necessity of these actions coming together to build a \\"current\\" capable of sweeping down the \\"mightiest walls of resistance.\\" This passage demonstrates both the value of singular actions and the power of collective efforts. As a result, it would be more accurate to say that Robert Kennedy felt that individual actions could be effective when combined with other like-minded actions, rather than asserting that he believed unilateral action alone was effective."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Single women should ditch Facebook because the 'perfect lives' of their friends are bad for their health, a relationship expert has warned. Author Zoe Strimpel says the social media site bombards singletons with pictures of 'perfect' weddings and babies which causes envy and voyeurism.

She. said getting rid of your profile will help 'limit that delicious but. yucky feeling of voyeurism, slight envy, maybe even narcissism.' Ms Strimpel, who wrote ‘Man Diet: One Woman’s Quest to End Bad Romance’, said the fairer sex also spends too much time monitoring potential suitors online. She said the ready availability of biographical information on Facebook encourages women to over-analyse potential dates.

'There’s plenty of psychology that supports taking a break from social media.' On a more positive note. The Joy of Sex rewriter Susan Quilliam told the same conference modern women have never had it better in bed. The psychologist, single at 63 after her marriage of 25 years ended, said women are free to enjoy sex - unlike her mother who didn’t know what her clitoris was.

(Not that we're counting or anything.) So much to be sorted out, so little time. Here are the seven biggest story lines to watch with a week left to go: 1. The obvious: Will Republicans win the Senate majority? This was the biggest question on Day One of the midterm campaign. It will stay that way until the very end. The GOP needs to gain six seats to win back the chamber. If you watch just three races, make them North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa. Polls show razor-tight races in these states, which could collectively decide which party controls the Senate. Also keep an eye on Georgia, where Democrats feel like they have some momentum. It could go to a runoff. (More on that below.) 2. Runoffs? You kidding me? Runoffs? The smart money says the Louisiana Senate race is headed to a runoff. Georgia may be headed to one, too. (Runoffs are triggered in those states if no candidate wins a majority.) If control of the Senate is on the line, these two states will be the focus of the political world for the next couple of months. Louisiana's runoff would be Dec. 6. Georgia's Senate runoff would be Jan. 6 -- after the new Congress is scheduled to be sworn in. 3. How many seats will Republicans gain in the House? It's becoming increasingly clear that this election is shaping up as a painful one for House Democrats. After talking up their recruits and offensive opportunities for months, they are shifting more and more money toward protecting endangered incumbents. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden (Ore.) has been saying for months that getting to 245 is an attainable goal for Republicans, who currently hold a 233-199 advantage. That would be a big victory for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Co. President Obama's low approval rating is dragging down Democrats everywhere. But the reason gaining a dozen seats is on the high end of what observers are predicting for Republicans is that they did so well in 2010 and there simple aren't nearly as many swing districts that can realistically be flipped. 4. Will Republicans hold their 29 gubernatorial seats? Republicans have set a public goal for governor's races: Walk away with 29 wins -- exactly the number they currently hold. What's so exciting about treading water? Well, considering that the GOP is defending 22 seats compared to just 14 for Democrats, and they have nine incumbents running in states Obama won twice, it would be more of an accomplishment than meets the eye. Democrats have declined to set a public goal of their own. Both sides have added unlikely pickup opportunities to the fold, scrambling the landscape. The GOP could spring upsets in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Colorado. Democrats could pick off Kansas and Georgia. 5. Is this the beginning, or is this the end? We're looking at you, Scott Walker and Martha Coakley. Two of the most interesting subplots in the gubernatorial landscape involve household names whose political fortunes hinge on the outcome next Tuesday: their careers will take a serious hit if they lose, and be set on a superstar trajectory if they win. If Walker wins reelection in Wisconsin, he will reaffirm his spot on the short list of top potential candidates for president. If he loses, he's no longer on that list. Polls shows Walker in a close race against Democratic challenger Mary Burke. Coakley, who lost to Scott Brown disastrously in 2010, is getting a second chance in Massachusetts -- although there are signs she might be about to blow it in the governor's race against Republican Charlie Baker: She's struggled to raise money, and has run a lackluster campaign. But she can still put it in the past with a win that would propel her to the top job in one of the most liberal states in the country. If she loses, it's hard to see her generating any enthusiasm for another campaign for higher office. 6. Can embattled Republicans Michael Grimm and Vance McAllister defy the odds and hold their House seats? Grimm (R-N.Y.) is under indictment on tax and business fraud allegations.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Are the following two questions the same? Why do men like women's butts? How does the shape of a women's butt matter in sexual pleasure? Do men like cute or hot women?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same; they address different aspects of attraction and sexual preferences. However, both questions belong to the realm of human sexuality and interpersonal attraction. Let's analyze each question individually, discussing the reasons men might be drawn to a particular preference. 1. Why do men like women's butts? How does the shape of a women's butt matter in sexual pleasure? Men's attraction to women's butts can be explained from evolutionary, biological, and cultural perspectives. From an evolutionary standpoint, men may be drawn to a woman's butt due to the correlation between hip-to-waist ratios and fertility. The lower a woman's hip-to-waist ratio, meaning smaller waist and wider hips, the more fertile she is believed to be, which could be an advantageous characteristic for a mate. Biologically, the sight of a curvaceous or rounded buttocks can induce an arousal response in men, as it signifies both fertility and physical fitness. The shape of a woman's buttocks is determined by muscle and fat distribution, with some studies speculating that men prefer a more balanced fat distribution, resulting in a firm but proportional buttocks shape. From a cultural perspective, various societies and social norms have idealized the shape of a woman's buttocks, making it a desirable trait. Media and fashion industries can further contribute to defining and reinforcing such preferences. As for sexual pleasure, the physical shape of a woman's buttocks may not directly impact sexual satisfaction for either partner. However, men might derive psychological pleasure from the visual appeal of a preferred buttocks shape, which could contribute to overall arousal and enjoyment. 2. Do men like cute or hot women? Preferences for \\"cute\\" or \\"hot\\" women are subjective and vary amongst individuals; these traits are not mutually exclusive, and might appeal to different men at different times or in different circumstances. \\"Cute\\" typically refers to a more youthful, innocent, or approachable aesthetic. This trait could be appealing to men who find comfort in nurturing or protective instincts. Additionally, cuteness can evoke positive and comforting emotions, which may foster a desire for emotional intimacy and attachment. On the other hand, \\"hot\\" generally denotes a sexually attractive appearance connoting maturity and confidence. Men who prefer a \\"hot\\" aesthetic might place a stronger emphasis on physical attraction and sexual experiences. A woman with a \\"hot\\" appearance might exude a sexual mystique and magnetism that can be enticing to men. In summary, the two questions are not the same but fall under the broader theme of attraction and sexual preferences. The first question deals primarily with the physical attraction to women's butts and its potential impact on sexual pleasure, while the second question delves into preferences for types of attractiveness, specifically \\"cute\\" versus \\"hot\\" women. Preferences across individuals will inevitably differ, shaped by factors such as biology, personal experiences, and cultural upbringing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But this idyllic 12th century church could not survive the fire that ripped through it hours before last Sunday's service. The once-iconic wooden vestry was destroyed, leaving its bells missing amid the rubble. Almost destroyed: The original roof and many pews were destroyed in the blaze that tore through the church. Firefighters battled the blaze for an hour at St Andrews Church in Romsey, Hampshire, just three-and-a-half hours before its regular Sunday service. Too dangerous for them to go inside, they used six pumps to put out the flames and stayed for several hours to prevent the fire flaring again. Only some of the church's treasures, including an irreplaceable 1613 'chained' Bible, were saved. A 13th century wooden chest was badly damaged and a limestone font, with graffiti from 1681, was severely damaged, possibly beyond repair. The West Window, in memory of a much-loved churchwarden Bill Watkinson, was destroyed. The bells of St Andrews Church in Romsey, Hampshire, the same ones from 1212, have been lost in the rubble. Around half of the roof at the west end has been gutted but the east end is relatively unscathed, including a 13th century screen. Churchwarden Catherine Baker said: 'I can't really believe it. 'I was called by a neighbour who saw smoke and I could hear the crackling. I feel absolute horror. 'The most shocking thing was seeing the flames. As far as I know we have never had a fire before. 'If the fire brigade had not got here the roof would have been completely destroyed. 'They have been wonderful, as have all the neighbours who raised the alarm. 'My husband Bill and daughter Isabel, who were first on the scene, saw things falling off the roof. Church warden Catherine Baker, standing outside, is distraught after the church's first fire in 900 years. 'There was not a lot we could do.' Churchgoer Peter Pritchett-Brown said: 'It is awful to see something like this happen to something that has stood here for so long.' The little 20 metres by eight metres church was due to hold a Sunday service at 11am for its 20 regular worshippers. However, parishioners gathered for prayers in a nearby house with Rev Canon Steve Pittis. The alarm was raised at 7.27am and the cause of the blaze is unclear and is still being investigated. Nobody was injured. Fire borough commander Dan Tasker said: 'The damage is quite extensive. 'The fire started at one end and spread into the roof and, unfortunately, half has been destroyed. 'It was a well-developed fire when the first crews arrived but the crews worked incredibly hard to stop it spreading.'","completion":"An idyllic 12th-century church, St. Andrews Church in Romsey, Hampshire, was ravaged by a fire just hours before its Sunday service, destroying its once-iconic wooden vestry and many pews, and damaging several irreplaceable artifacts.

Please answer the following question: Process: - There is a rain cloud in the sky - Small bits of ice within the cloud bump each other - The collisions create electrical charge - Lighter, positively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud - Heavier, negatively charges particles rise to the top - When the positive and negative charges grow large enough, a giant spark, called lightning occurs - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wind spreads more spores happens, how will it affect an increase in positive particles at the bottom of the cloud. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests a change in the initial conditions of the process, which, in this case, is the spreading of more spores due to the wind. To understand if this perturbation would have an effect on the presence of positive particles at the bottom of the cloud and the subsequent lightning occurrence, let's first delve deeper into the mechanisms involved in charge buildup within clouds and how spores may potentially influence them. Rain cloud formation typically starts with water droplets condensing around aerosols, which can be natural particles like dust, pollen, or spores. These microscopic particles, called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), serve as the basis for the growth of water droplets within the cloud. As the cloud develops and temperature drops, some of these water droplets freeze into ice particles. As you described, the collisions between small ice particles take place within the cloud, with lighter and positively charged particles settling toward the bottom, while heavier and negatively charged ones rise to the top. This charge separation creates an electric field within the cloud and on the ground below. When the difference in electrical charge between the cloud and the ground becomes significant enough, lightning occurs, discharging the built-up electrical energy. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis, let's evaluate whether the presence of more spores due to increased wind will have a direct or indirect impact on the charge buildup within the cloud. Spores, when introduced as aerosols, can influence cloud formation by serving as additional CCN. This can potentially lead to higher droplet concentrations within the cloud and ultimately, a higher number of ice particles. However, the actual charge separation process mainly depends on the physics of interaction occurring between ice particles, as well as temperature and other environmental factors. While the increased concentration of spores and the consequent increase in ice particle count might slightly alter the frequency and intensity of these interactions, it is unlikely to have a significant direct influence on the overall charge separation process. The primary component of the question's hypothesis is the possibility that the presence of more spores will specifically increase the positive charge concentration at the bottom of the cloud. Yet, since the charge separation mechanism predominantly relies on factors like the size, shape, and relative motion of ice particles in connection to collision processes, a larger number of spores would not necessarily translate to a sizeable change in the distribution of positive charges. In conclusion, while the supposed perturbation in this hypothesis might result in more ice particles (and subsequently increase the number of collisions within the cloud), it is unlikely to have a strong direct or indirect effect on the charge separation process that leads to lightning occurrence. Thus, the introduction of more spores due to wind may not significantly impact the concentration of positive particles at the bottom of the cloud. However, more research and detailed analysis could help provide a comprehensive understanding of the subtle interplay between spores and cloud electrification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.

The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized. - Stephan Groth ( born August 10 , 1971 in Odense , Denmark ) is the man behind Apoptygma Berzerk , an electronic body music act that plays in styles such as synthpop , ebm , and futurepop . Stephan Leonard Groth was born in Odense , Denmark but relocated with his family to his father 's home town Sarpsborg , Norway in 1986 . Along with Ronan Harris of VNV Nation and the members of Covenant , he is considered by many to be one of the pioneers of the futurepop genre of the late 1990s and early 2000s .

Stephan took guest appearance in Satyricon 's album Megiddo . - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz. - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - VNV Nation is an English/Irish electronic music band originally from Dublin and Essex and now based in Hamburg, Germany. They combine elements of synthpop, trance and electronic body music (EBM). The members are Ronan Harris and Mark Jackson. The \\"VNV\\" in the name stands for \\"Victory Not Vengeance\\", in keeping with the group's motto, \\"One should strive to achieve, not sit in bitter regret.\\" - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk. - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Icon of Coil is a Norwegian electronic music band. The band was established as a solo project in 1997 by Andy LaPlegua who was joined by former Sector 9 (now Moonitor and Zombie Girl) bandmate Sebastian Komor to perform live. With the release of \\"Shallow Nation\\", the band's first single, Komor joined full-time. In 2000, Christian Lund joined the live lineup. Later that year the band's first full-length album, \\"Serenity is the Devil\\", was released, which climbed to number one on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Shortly thereafter, Lund became a full-time band member. - Unheilig (German for \\"Unholy\\") is a German band that features a variety of influences including various pop and electronic styles as well as harder, nihilistic hard rock. The band was founded in 1999 and principally consists of singer Bernd Heinrich \\"Der Graf\\" Graf along with various musical partners. He has been accompanied for live shows with musicians Christoph \\"Licky\\" Termühlen, Henning Verlage, and Martin \\"Potti\\" Potthoff. The group's debut, \\"Phosphor\\", came out in 2000. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Sarpsborg , historically Borg, is a city and municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Sarpsborg. - Beborn Beton is a German synthpop band founded in 1989, with their first album release in 1993. Their debut named \\"Tybalt\\" is a compilation of the best tracks written in the first three years of their band history and was very well received in the electronic music scene. In 1995 the follow-up album \\"Concrete Ground\\" was released. After a change of record label in 1996 their break-through album \\"Nightfall\\" was published featuring the club-filler \\"Im Innern Einer Frau\\". - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark. It has a population of 175,245 as of January 2016, and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album \\"The Second Annual Report\\", they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\"; \\"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\\". - Hans Christian Andersen (often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen; (2 April 1805 4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called in Danish, express themes that transcend age and nationality. - Apoptygma Berzerk (commonly abbreviated to APB or APOP) is a Norwegian musical group. They have achieved success with a brand of synthpop, and ballads backed with electronic rhythms, commonly known within the scene and referring to themselves as \\"futurepop\\". Apoptygma Berzerk has over 30 releases and won awards and Top 10 spots in Germany and Scandinavia. Apoptygma Berzerk has toured Europe, North America, South America, Israel and Australia with bands such as VNV Nation, Beborn Beton, Icon of Coil and Unheilig. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Electronic body music (EBM) is a music genre that combines elements of post-industrial music and electropunk. It first came to prominence in Belgium and was considered a part of the European new wave movement. - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom. - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.

At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament. - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \\"habeas corpus\\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles. The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the American Constitution in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States. Research by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state. - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\". - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament taxation, legislation and policy-making but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th centurywhen it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdomsuntil 1707, when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. - Middlesex is a former United Kingdom Parliamentary constituency . It was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of England , then of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 , and finally of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1885 . - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland. - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The Middle Saxons or Middel Seaxe were a people whose territory later became, with somewhat contracted boundaries, the county of Middlesex, England. It included the early London settlement, and probably Surrey, the \\"south region\\" of the Middle Saxon territory. What is the relationship between 'middlesex ' and 'united kingdom of great britain and ireland'? A:","completion":"Middlesex is a county in southeast England, which was a distinct administrative and political entity until 1965. Since then, most of its area has become part of Greater London, with small parts in neighbouring counties. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom, is a sovereign country that includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Therefore, Middlesex, at its current state as part of Greater London, is within the United Kingdom. Prior to 1801, when the Kingdom of Great Britain was combined with the Kingdom of Ireland to form United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Middlesex was part of the Kingdom of Great Britain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To prove similar triangles using the AA theorem, follow these steps: 1. Identify the corresponding angles in the two triangles that are being compared. This can be done by examining the relationships between the sides and angles of each triangle or by using shared or adjacent angles in the figure. 2. Determine if the identified angles in the triangles are congruent. Two angles are congruent if they have the same measure or can be proven to be the same through a previous step in the proof or by using other congruent angles in the figure. 3. If two corresponding angles are congruent, then according to the AA theorem, the triangles are similar. This is because if two angles of a triangle are congruent, the third angle must also be congruent, making all three angles in the triangles match. In addition to the AA theorem, there are other methods for proving triangle similarity, such as the side-side-side (SSS) and side-angle-side (SAS) similarity theorems. The SSS similarity theorem states that if the three sides of one triangle are proportional to the three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are similar. The SAS similarity theorem states that if two pairs of corresponding sides in two triangles are proportional and the included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar. In summary, the given text does imply that there are ways to tell if triangles are similar, with the primary method mentioned being the angle-angle theorem. Other methods, such as the side-side-side and side-angle-side similarity theorems, can also be used to prove triangle similarity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Plan your market strategy and project your profits or losses. Consider including an appendix. Show your business plan to established lawyers.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Crafting a Comprehensive Business Plan: An Essential Guide for Entrepreneurs An executive summary presents an overview of your business prospects and functioning aspects, creating an impetus for potential investors to delve deeper into your business plan. It is a concise summary of what your business is about, its core values, and the strategic plans to achieve your goals. Ideally, it includes an introduction to your company, a summary of your business structure, the services you plan to provide, and reasons why your business will be successful. Firstly, the description of your firm shapes the first impression of your potential investors. This portion must be impeccably written and encapsulate the essence of your enterprise. The company description section should include information about the nature of your business, its strategic location, the problems it plans to solve, and how it aims to provide solutions. For instance, if you are putting up a legal consultancy firm, detail how your firm can provide efficient and effective solutions that other businesses lack in resolving legal issues. The services you plan to provide are vital in defining the scope of your business. This section should describe the nature of services, elucidate how these services meet customer needs, discuss their pricing, and present a comparison of your services with those of similar businesses. Next, commencing a market analysis will elucidate the viability of your business concept. This analysis involves assessing your industry's size and structure, examining market trends, evaluating your competition, and identifying your target market. It will also assist in identifying your Unique Selling Proposition, thereby making your business stand out among competitors. Your business plan must illustrate an organizational structure, describing the hierarchal setup of your company, job roles of team members, and how your business operations flow. This delineates who should be held accountable for decision-making processes and provides tangible evidence of your company's readiness for the investment. Furthermore, details about ownership also form an integral part of your business plan. It demonstrates who owns the business, the ownership structure (whether it's a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or LLC), and the percentage of ownership each investor holds. The marketing strategy is significant for understanding how to acquire customers, retain them, and ensure continuous growth in business. It should cover your sales forecast, sales and distribution plan, communication plan, and more. This section often includes details about marketing expenditures, market positioning, and return on investments. Your business plan should also include a financial outlook, projecting profits or losses. It should outline your business expenses, revenue model, profitability projections, and the time frame anticipated for turning a profit. This section gives potential investors a clear view of your business’s financial strength and stability. Consider including an appendix that serves as a repository for any additional supporting documents that are relevant but do not fit into the main body of the plan. It may include items such as credit histories, resumes of key managers, product pictures, legal documents, and contracts. Finally, before finalizing your business plan, forward the draft to established lawyers. This is to ensure legal compliance and minimize the possibility of overlooking critical legal frameworks. Lawyers can scrutinize the draft to spot and rectify legal pitfalls in your plan, thereby ensuring the lawful execution of your business. In conclusion, crafting a comprehensive business plan requires in-depth research, detailed planning, and laborious attention to detail. Your business plan is more than mere paperwork; it is a continuous and essential tool embodying the heartache, passion, and aspiration of your entrepreneurial journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about Mr. Tenorly?

The move toward this more demanding standard has been slowly evolving. Indeed it is our belief that even though courts in this circuit have articulated the “sham and mockery” test, they have been in fact applying the more stringent “reasonably competent” test, and that formal adoption of this standard represents a change in name.

Would \\"The rope is too short to do the entire route in one pitch (necessity).\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose from: (A). No; (B). Yes; The answer is:","completion":"(A). No; Pitch in climbing refers to a section of a climb between two belay points, where the leader ascends, placing protection (either traditional gear or clipping quickdraws to bolts) and the follower ascends while taking in the protection. A climbing route can be divided into multiple pitches, with each pitch covering a certain section of the climb, depending on various factors such as the route's length, difficulty, and available protection. The leader belays the second climber at the end of each pitch, and they often swap roles to continue up the route. The rope length plays an important role in determining the number of pitches on a climbing route. Generally, one pitch length tends to not exceed half of the rope length (usually climbing ropes are between 50 and 80 meters long). This is to allow the belayer to lower the climber back down if required and to accommodate for rope stretch during falls. If a route is too long for one pitch, it will be broken into multiple pitches, and belay stations will be set up accordingly, ensuring that the rope does not run out during any part of the climb. Your example sentence could be restructured for better clarity: \\"The rope is too short to do the entire route in one pitch, necessitating dividing the route into multiple pitches.\\" By rephrasing the statement, it clarifies that the given rope length will not allow the climbers to complete the entire route in a single pitch, and the need to break it into multiple pitches arises."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which entity is this text about? King was born in Long Beach, California, into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of Betty (nee Jerman), a housewife, and Bill Moffitt, a firefighter. Billie Jean's family was athletic. Her mother excelled at swimming, her father played basketball, baseball and ran track. Her younger brother, Randy Moffitt, became a Major League Baseball pitcher, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays. In 1982, King was 38 years old and the twelfth-seed at Wimbledon. In her third round match with Tanya Harford of South Africa, King was down 7-5, 5-4 (40-0) before saving three match points to win the second set 7-6(2) and then the third set 6-3. King said in her post-match press conference, \\"I can't recall the previous time I have been so close to defeat and won. When I was down 4-5 and love-40, I told myself, 'You have been here 21 years, so use that experience and hang on.'\\" In the fourth round, King upset sixth-seeded Australian Wendy Turnbull in straight sets. King then upset third-seeded Tracy Austin in the quarterfinals 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 to become the oldest female semifinalist at Wimbledon since Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers in 1920. This was King's first career victory over Austin after five defeats and reversed the result of their 1979 Wimbledon quarterfinal. King said in her post-match press conference, \\"Today, I looked at the scoreboard when I was 2-0 in the third set and the '2' seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. In 1979, when I was up 2-0 at the same stage, I was tired and didn't have anything left. But today I felt so much better and was great mentally.\\" Two days later in the semifinals, which was King's 250th career match at Wimbledon in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles, the second-seeded Chris Evert defeated King on her fifth match point 7-6(4), 2-6, 6-3. King was down a set and 2-1 in the second set before winning five consecutive games to even the match. King explained that she actually lost the match in the first set by failing to convert break points at 15-40 in the second and fourth games. She reached the semifinals in her final appearance at Wimbledon, losing to Andrea Jaeger 6-1, 6-1 after beating Kathy Jordan in the quarterfinals, seventh-seeded Wendy Turnbull in the fourth round, and Rosemary Casals, her longtime doubles partner, in the third round. Jaeger claims that she was highly motivated to defeat King because King had defeated Turnbull, a favorite of Jaeger's, and because King refused a towel from an attendant just before her match with Jaeger, explaining, \\"I'm not going to sweat in this match.\\" King became the oldest WTA player to win a singles tournament when she won the Edgbaston Cup grass court tournament in Birmingham at 39 years, 7 months and 23 days after a straight-sets victory in the final against Alycia Moulton. The final official singles match of King's career was a second round loss to Catherine Tanvier at the 1983 Australian Open.","completion":"This text is about Billie Jean King, a former professional tennis player who won numerous titles and awards throughout her career.

In her final appearance at Wimbledon, King reached the semifinals again, ultimately losing to Andrea Jaeger. It's interesting to note that Jaeger had additional motivation to win against King due to her friendship with Wendy Turnbull and a pre-match incident involving King and a towel.

The term was commonly used during the early Middle Ages. Step 2: Analyzing whether \\"Sklavinoi\\" can be considered a 'disputed' Byzantine term There seems to be no clear dispute regarding the term \\"Sklavinoi\\" as it pertains to its meaning or use in the Byzantine era. Its origin can be traced to the Greek term \\"Σκλάβοι\\" which itself derives from the Latin word \\"Sclavus\\" or \\"Slavus,\\" a term used to refer to Slavic people. However, the term is not identified as being highly disputed. Step 3: Evaluate if \\"Sklavinoi\\" was loaned into Arabic as \\"Saqaliba\\" Indeed, the Byzantine term \\"Sklavinoi\\" was loaned into Arabic as \\"Saqaliba\\" (صقالبة, singular: Saqlabi صقلبي). The Arabic term \\"Saqaliba\\" referred to Slavic people, particularly those who were captured and served in various capacities within Islamic societies during the medieval era. The term was used to describe Slavic slaves, soldiers, administrators, and eunuchs in the Islamic world. Conclusion: While the term \\"Sklavinoi\\" was loaned into Arabic as \\"Saqaliba,\\" it is not evident that the origin of the term \\"Sklavinoi\\" is highly disputed in the context of Byzantium.

The statements are: 1. Two women hikers are looking out over a scenic bridge. 2. There are two females thinking something about a scenic bridge. Let's break down each statement and examine the similarities and differences between them. Statement 1: - The subjects of the statement are two women who are identified primarily as hikers. - The action they are taking is \\"looking out\\" over the scenic bridge, which suggests they are observing and appreciating the view. - The words \\"scenic bridge\\" describe where the women are and their focal point. Statement 2: - The subjects are described as two females. This matches the gender reference in the first statement, but it doesn't mention whether they are hikers or not. - The action involves thinking about the scenic bridge. This is different from the first statement, which specifies that they are looking out over the bridge. The second statement leaves their physical position and the nature of their thoughts open to interpretation. - The reference to the \\"scenic bridge\\" connects the two statements and suggests that both refer to the same location. Now that we have analyzed the statements separately, we can determine whether it is possible to conclude that they describe the same situation. The subjects in both statements are women; however, the first statement identifies them as hikers, while the second statement does not provide this information. Additionally, the first statement implies a clear action and location—that the women are standing near the bridge, looking out over it—while the second statement only conveys that they are thinking about the bridge. Their thoughts, physical position, and whether they are actively looking at the bridge remain unclear in the second statement. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine with certainty that the two statements are describing the same scenario. The lack of information about the subjects' role as hikers and their physical position in the second statement leaves room for interpretation.

After the Foreign Minister announce its denuclearization commitment. SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... Question: When did President Trump announce his plans to suspend military exercises? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"(b). After he met with Kim Jong Un on June 12th. U.S. President Trump announced his plans to suspend military exercises after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12th. This decision was made as a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum between the U.S. and North Korea and to encourage the denuclearization commitment made by North Korea during the summit. The South Korean Foreign Minister, Kang Kyung-wha, clarified that while this decision came suddenly, it was made jointly by the U.S. and South Korea, and it is not irreversible. If North Korea fails to live up to its denuclearization commitment or the dialogue momentum loses speed, the joint military exercises could quickly resume."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What is the term for the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid? A: Answer:","completion":"The term for the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid is called the \\"melting point.\\" The melting point is a specific temperature at which the solid phase of a substance becomes unstable, and its particles gain enough energy to overcome the forces holding them together, transitioning into the liquid phase. At the melting point, the solid and liquid phases of a substance are in equilibrium, meaning that the rates of melting and freezing are equal. This balance ensures that as long as the temperature remains at the melting point, both solid and liquid can coexist. If there is an increase in temperature above the melting point, more particles gain energy, causing the entire solid to eventually melt. On the other hand, if the temperature goes below the melting point, the particles will lose energy and return to the solid phase as the liquid freezes. The melting point of a substance depends on multiple factors, including the molecular structure, bonding strength, and external pressure. In general, substances with strong intermolecular forces – such as ionic or covalent solid compounds – tend to have higher melting points than those with weaker forces, like van der Waals interactions that are found in molecular compounds. External pressure can also influence the melting point. As pressure increases, the melting point may increase as well, since the particles need more energy to overcome the increased force pushing them closer together. However, this relationship may vary depending on the specific substance. Different substances have unique melting points. A well-known example is water, which has a melting point of 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under normal atmospheric pressure. Other common substances and their melting points include: - Ice, the solid phase of water: 0°C (32°F) - Table salt (sodium chloride): 801°C (1474°F) - Iron: 1538°C (2800°F) - Gold: 1064°C (1947°F) In practical applications, the melting point is a crucial characteristic that helps to determine the suitable usage of various materials. For instance, it is essential to consider the melting points of metals when choosing materials for building elements that will be exposed to high temperatures, such as in electric wiring or construction of engines. In summary, the melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid. This point is determined by the substance's molecular structure, bonding strength, and external pressure, making it an essential property to consider in both scientific research and practical applications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Telmatosaurus (meaning \\"marsh lizard\\") is a genus of basal hadrosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was a relatively small hadrosaur, approximately five meters (16 ft) long, found in what is now Romania. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU. - The Late Cretaceous (100.566 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the Cretaceous period is divided in the geologic timescale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time. - The tibia (plural tibiae or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and it connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula, and closer to the median plane or centre-line. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of the leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute \\"tibia\\". It is the second largest bone in the human body next to the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body. - The femur (pl. \\"femurs\\" or \\"femora\\" ) or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the hip joint) bone of the [leg] in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the hindlimbs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Orthomerus ( meaning \`\` straight femur '' ) is a genus of duckbill dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of The Netherlands and Belgium . It is today an obscure genus , but in the past was conflated with the much better known Telmatosaurus . - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A hindlimb is a posterior limb on an animal, especially the quadrupeds. When referring to quadrupeds, the term hind leg is often instead used. - In humans, the thigh is the area between the pelvis and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Hadrosaurids (\\"hadrós\\", \\"stout, thick\\"), or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. This group is also known as the duck-billed dinosaurs, for the flat, duck-bill appearance of their mouths. The family, which includes ornithopods such as \\"Edmontosaurus\\" and \\"Parasaurolophus\\", was a common herbivore in the Upper Cretaceous Period of what is now Asia, Europe, Antarctica, South America and North America. Hadrosaurids are descendants of the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout. Like the rest of the ornithischians, these animals had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosaurids are divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (\\"Lambeosaurinae\\"), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes, and the saurolophines, identified as hadrosaurines in most pre-2010 works (\\"Saurolophinae\\" or\\" Hadrosaurinae\\"), which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines are divided into Aralosaurines, Lambeosaurines, Parasaurolophines and Tsintaosaurines, while Saurolophines include Saurolophus, Brachylophosaurines and Kritosaurines. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes.

Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (; German: ['gotlo:p 'fre:g@]; 8 November 1848 - 26 July 1925) was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician. He is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics. Though largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers. Frege matriculated at the University of Jena in the spring of 1869 as a citizen of the North German Confederation. In the four semesters of his studies he attended approximately twenty courses of lectures, most of them on mathematics and physics. His most important teacher was Ernst Karl Abbe (1840-1905; physicist, mathematician, and inventor). Abbe gave lectures on theory of gravity, galvanism and electrodynamics, complex analysis theory of functions of a complex variable, applications of physics, selected divisions of mechanics, and mechanics of solids. Abbe was more than a teacher to Frege: he was a trusted friend, and, as director of the optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, he was in a position to advance Frege's career. After Frege's graduation, they came into closer correspondence. His other notable university teachers were Christian Philipp Karl Snell (1806-86; subjects: use of infinitesimal analysis in geometry, analytical geometry of planes, analytical mechanics, optics, physical foundations of mechanics); Hermann Karl Julius Traugott Schaeffer (1824-1900; analytical geometry, applied physics, algebraic analysis, on the telegraph and other electronic machines); and the philosopher Kuno Fischer (1824-1907; Kantian and critical philosophy). Starting in 1871, Frege continued his studies in Gottingen, the leading university in mathematics in German-speaking territories, where he attended the lectures of Rudolf Friedrich Alfred Clebsch (1833-72; analytical geometry), Ernst Christian Julius Schering (1824-97; function theory), Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804-91; physical studies, applied physics), Eduard Riecke (1845-1915; theory of electricity), and Hermann Lotze (1817-81; philosophy of religion). Many of the philosophical doctrines of the mature Frege have parallels in Lotze; it has been the subject of scholarly debate whether or not there was a direct influence on Frege's views arising from his attending Lotze's lectures. In 1873, Frege attained his doctorate under Ernst Christian Julius Schering, with a dissertation under the title of \\"Ueber eine geometrische Darstellung der imaginaren Gebilde in der Ebene\\" (\\"On a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in a Plane\\"), in which he aimed to solve such fundamental problems in geometry as the mathematical interpretation of projective geometry's infinitely distant (imaginary) points. Frege married Margarete Katharina Sophia Anna Lieseberg (15 February 1856 - 25 June 1904) on 14 March 1887.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did he study at Jena?","completion":"Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege studied at the University of Jena, where he matriculated in the spring of 1869.

The premise states: \\"Child playing with a hula hoop on a cement driveway in housing allotment.\\" This statement describes a particular scenario where a child is playing with a hula hoop on a cement driveway which is situated in a housing allotment. A housing allotment is an area of land that is divided into smaller plots for individual residential houses or other buildings. In this scene, the child is outdoors, and the specific location is a cement driveway, which could be a common space shared by residents in the housing allotment or could belong to a specific house. The hypothesis suggests: \\"Child playing with a hula hoop in his home.\\" This statement focuses on a child playing with a hula hoop within the confines of his own home. The word \\"home\\" generally refers to an individual's residence, which could include both indoor and outdoor areas, like a front yard, patio, or backyard. There is a relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, as both statements describe the same activity - a child playing with a hula hoop - which implies that they might be referring to the same situation. Moreover, housing allotments often consist of individual homes, which further connects the two statements. However, it is essential to notice that the hypothesis is less specific than the premise. The premise establishes a clear location for the scene: a cement driveway within a housing allotment. In contrast, the hypothesis simply refers to the child playing at home, with no reference to a driveway or the housing allotment. Furthermore, while the hypothesis assumes that the child is playing in his own home, the premise doesn't provide information on whether the driveway where the child is playing is a part of his home or if it is a shared space within the housing allotment. Given the available information, the link between the premise and the hypothesis is not strong enough to establish a definite connection. Therefore, we cannot conclusively accept or reject the hypothesis based solely on the premise. To determine if the hypothesis can be accepted, additional information regarding the child's residence, whether the cement driveway is a part of his home or a common space in the housing allotment, and any other relevant contextual details would be necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Testifying on the second day of Holmes' preliminary hearing, Garrett Gumbinner said Holmes booby-trapped his apartment with explosives and triggering devices that would be tripped when the front door was opened. The explosive devices included homemade napalm, thermite, and glycerin Holmes designed to mix with potassium permanganate, a mix of metal powder and oxides, igniting a fire or explosion. Holmes had also set up a detonator outside of his Aurora apartment building, hoping someone would come along and trigger the device, normally designed to control a remote-controlled toy car. Gumbinner's testimony underscored the elaborate planning Arapahoe County District prosecutors contend Holmes used to carry out a premeditated massacre at Aurora's Century 16 Cineplex in the early hours of July 20. The preliminary hearing will determine if there is sufficient evidence to try Holmes on more than 160 charges of first degree murder and attempted murder. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The state of Colorado continues to hear overwhelming evidence against Aurora theater shooting suspect James Holmes. (Jan 8.) KUSA Gumbinner detailed how Holmes rigged his apartment's entryway with fishing line, tied to a thermos bottle in the kitchen. When the door was opened, it was designed to knock over the thermos containing glycerin and positioned above a pan filled with potassium permanganate. When combined, the chemical reaction sets off sparks. Holmes apartment was filled jars of napalm and other incendiaries. Even the carpet was soaked with gasoline and oil, which set ablaze, would have intensified the carnage, Gumbinner said. Police were alerted to his apartment by a neighbor who heard loud music Holmes had pre-programmed to play on his computer. Holmes also told arresting officers -- who found him in police style protective gear by his car at the rear of the theater -- that there were explosives at the apartment. Authorities later disarmed the devices without mishap. Aurora Police detectives and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) Supervisor Steven Beggs outlined a series of purchases Holmes made beginning on May 10, when he bought two teargas grenades online from an on-line supplier. He later purchased tactical gear, the chemicals used for explosives, nearly 6,300 rounds of ammunition and four weapons found at the theater; a semi-automatic assault rifle, pump-action shotgun, a laser-guided pistol and a second handgun in the weeks leading up to the shootings. All of the items were purchased legally at Denver area stores or through Internet dealers from California to Maryland. Aurora Police Detective Craig Apple, who has supervised Holmes' case, later testified that 76 shots were fired in the theater, including 65 from the assault rifle, six from the shotgun and five from a Glock pistol. The weapons have the same serial numbers as those purchased by Holmes between May 22 and July 6, Apple said. Apple also testified that following his arrest, Holmes acted irrationally at a detention facility, at one point, taking a staple from a desk and trying to insert it into wall electrical outlet. At another point, Holmes made puppet motions with his hands, which had been covered with bags before they were tested for gunshot residue. Holmes' attorneys say their 25-year-old client, a University of Colorado doctoral program dropout, suffers from mental illness and have indicated they will mount an insanity defense. Holmes, who dropped out in June after failing an oral exam, was seeing a school psychiatrist. But prosecutors -- who wrapped up the witness portion of their case late Tuesday -- summoned Aurora Police Detective Tom Wilton to testify earlier in the day that Holmes had shown premeditation not just by his weapons purchases, but when he opened accounts with online dating services match.com and AdultFriendFinder.com weeks before the shootings. His dating profiles were headlined \\"Will You Visit Me In Prison?\\" Wilton's testimony drew some snickers from the courtroom audience, which included shooting victims and family members. But Holmes, bound at the hands and feet and flanked by several armed sheriff's deputies, again sat impassively through testimony. Except for briefly rocking his chair in a sideways motion for a few minutes Tuesday afternoon, Holmes stared straight ahead. Earlier in the hearing Tuesday, witnesses testified about some of the chilling 911 calls that came from the theater as the shooting began. Detective Randy Hansen said there were 41 separate calls within the first few minutes of the shooting. The first call to police played in court came from inside the theater from Kevin Quinonez at 12:38 a.m. Hansen said during the 27-second call he heard at least 30 gun shots. The call came in 18 minutes into the showing of The Dark Knight Rises. Police also played a 911 call from Kaylin Bailey, the teenage cousin of 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, the youngest person killed. Veronica's mother, Ashley Moser, was also shot. She miscarried after the shooting and is partially paralyzed. Bailey frantically called emergency dispatchers, who tried to talk her through administering CPR. As screams filled the theater, a panicked Bailey sobbed, said she couldn't hear and couldn't do it. Some courtroom witnesses dabbed their eyes during the tape. Holmes stared straight ahead as the call was played, showing no emotion. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/UGXqPL ||||| CENTENNIAL — Just after midnight, the boombox would blare the music. The music would draw the attention. The attention would cause someone to jostle the door. The door would tug the fishing line. The line would topple the thermos full of glycerin, and the glycerin would mix in the frying pan with the potassium permanganate to create a flame. The flame would set the petroleum-soaked carpet on fire. The fire would light the fuses. The fuses would detonate the jars filled with either homemade thermite, smokeless powder or stove-top napalm mixed with bullets. The nonexplosive ammonium chloride powder sprinkled across the floor by the front door was there just to create smoke and scare the police. And that, FBI agent Garrett Gumbinner testified Tuesday in the second day of preliminary hearings in the Aurora theater massacre, was one of two active — but untriggered — explosive systems that detectives found inside suspect James Holmes' apartment. \\"The whole apartment would have either exploded or caught fire,\\" Gumbinner said. After an opening day of dramatic testimony about the July 20 shooting that left 12 dead and 58 wounded, prosecutors and defense attorneys focused their attention Tuesday on the crux of the case: Is Holmes a calculated killer or mentally ill? Through the testimony of several investigators, prosecutors spent the day seeking to show a depth of forethought and planning to the attack. And, in cross-examination, defense attorneys hinted even more openly that they intend to argue his actions were driven by mental illness. Advertisement The hearing — which serves the relatively banal purpose of determining whether there is enough evidence against Holmes for him to face trial on 166 counts of murder, attempted murder, explosives possession and committing a crime of violence — could end as early as Wednesday. Prosecutors said Tuesday afternoon that they are on their last witness. Gumbinner was one of two detectives who interviewed Holmes the afternoon following the early-morning shooting, hoping to learn how to safely defuse the explosive tangle they say he created. \\"He said he rigged his apartment to explode and catch fire,\\" Gumbinner said of Holmes. \\"He said he was hoping to send resources to his apartment rather than the theater. By resources, I mean law enforcement.\\" In addition to Gumbinner, an Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent detailed the 16 separate purchases Holmes is accused of making to acquire the four guns; 6,295 rounds of rifle, shotgun and handgun ammunition; dozens of gun magazines; ballistic gear; weapon slings; two laser sights; two tear-gas canisters; hundreds of practice targets; explosive chemicals; fireworks supplies; handcuffs; and a military first-aid dressing. Family members of victims in the Aurora theater shooting arrive for court Tuesday morning, January 8, 2013, in Centennial. (RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post) ATF agent Steven Beggs said the purchases — all from online retailers or the Gander Mountain and Bass Pro Shops sporting goods stores in the metro area — began May 10 and ended July 14. There were five purchases in the first week of July alone. An Aurora detective also testified about two online dating profiles Holmes placed on the websites Match.com and Adult Friend Finder. Detective Tom Welton said Holmes, in both profiles, asked the same question: \\"Will you visit me in prison?\\" But, as prosecutors sought to establish premeditation in the attack, Holmes' attorneys also revealed more of their strategy. Thomas Teves, left, and his wife Caren Teves arrive for court, Tuesday, January 8, 2013, in Centennial. The Teves' son, Alex, died in the theater shooting. (RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post) After prosecutors finished questioning Beggs, defense attorney Tamara Brady asked him whether it was illegal, for instance, to buy body armor or tear gas. Beggs said it wasn't in Colorado. \\"Is there any process in place in Colorado,\\" Brady persisted, \\"to screen out whether a severely mentally ill person is purchasing these items?\\" Beggs said no. In afternoon testimony, Aurora homicide Detective Craig Appel testified that police did not request a blood sample from Holmes after he was arrested. He said Holmes' pupils were wide, but that \\"I saw no indication that he was under the influence of anything.\\" But under defense questioning, he said Holmes' behavior was at times odd while he was under observation. Paper bags had been placed over his hands to preserve evidence and Holmes played with them as though they were puppets, Appel said. He also tried to place a staple into an electrical socket, he said. Throughout Tuesday, there were reminders of the human tragedy that brought Holmes and the victims' families together in the same courtroom. Early in the day, prosecutors played a 911 call from a panicked 13-year-old girl. Two of her cousins — police later determined they were Ashley Moser and Moser's 6-year-old daughter, Veronica — had been shot. They needed help, the girl told the dispatcher between sobs. The noisy chaos of the theater filled the background. \\"Kneel beside your cousin,\\" the dispatcher instructed the girl. \\"I can't hear you,\\" her voice pleaded back. \\"I'm so sorry.\\" The girl began to cry. \\"Ma'am, we need to start CPR,\\" the dispatcher began again. \\"I can't,\\" she said. \\"I will walk you through the steps,\\" the dispatcher said. The call ended with police arriving. They could not save Veronica. Tuesday's portion of the hearing concluded with Aurora Sgt. Matthew Fyles on the witness stand, going name by name through a list of wounded victims and detailing their injuries. Two were paralyzed. One lost his leg. One was eviscerated but lived. One suffered permanent brain damage. One miscarried after the shooting. Two others were pregnant and have since given birth. When prosecutor Karen Pearson reached her question about Ethan Rohrs, who was 4 months old when the shooting occurred, she paused. \\"Was Ethan Rohrs a baby?\\" she asked Fyles. \\"Yes,\\" replied Fyles, his voice worn with emotion from reading the list. \\"He still is.\\" John Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/john_ingold ||||| A detective says the alleged gunman in the Colorado theater shooting acted strangely in an interview soon after the attack.

(Associated Press) Det. Craig Appel testified Tuesday that James Holmes had paper bags over his hands to preserve gunshot residue. Holmes played with the bags as if they were puppets. Appel said Holmes also played with a cup on the table and tried to jam a staple into an electrical outlet. Defense attorney Daniel King asked whether Holmes had been tested for drugs or other substances. Appel said there was no indication that he was under the influence of anything. Appel acknowledged that Holmes' pupils' were dilated, something that had also been noted by the officer who arrested him. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. An elaborate booby trap system allegedly set up to pull police away from the Colorado theater shooting included improvised napalm and thermite, which burns so hot that water can't put out the blaze. FBI bomb technician Garrett Gumbinner described the system Tuesday at a hearing in which prosecutors laid out their case against suspected gunman James Holmes. He said three different ignition systems were found in Holmes' apartment. There was a thermos full of glycerin leaning over a skillet full of another chemical. Flames and sparks are created when they mix, and a trip wire linked the thermos to the door. Police said Holmes hoped loud music would lure someone to the apartment. Prosecutors are trying to show in what is expected to be a weeklong hearing that the attack that killed 12 and wounded dozens July 20 was a premeditated act and that Holmes should stand trial. Defense attorneys say he is mentally ill. Daniel King, one of Holmes' lawyers, on Monday pointedly asked a pathologist who had just detailed each of the fatalities: \\"You're aware that people can be found not guilty on the grounds of insanity?\\" When officers arrived at the theater, they found Holmes standing next to his car. At first, Officer Jason Oviatt said, he thought Holmes was a policeman because of how he was dressed but then realized he was just standing there and not rushing toward the theater. Oviatt said Holmes seemed \\"very, very relaxed\\" and didn't seem to have \\"normal emotional reactions\\" to things. \\"He seemed very detached,\\" he said. After arresting Holmes, Officer Justin Grizzle asked him if anyone had been helping him or working with him. \\"He just looked at me and smiled ... like a smirk,\\" Grizzle recalled. So far, the trial has focused on the horror Aurora police officers discovered at the theater. The magnitude of the attack could be heard in the first 911 call to police, played Tuesday in court. It lasted 27 seconds and police say at least 30 shots could be heard. The call came in 18 minutes into the showing of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\". Police also played a 911 call from a teenage cousin of 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, the youngest person killed. A dispatcher tried to talk her through CPR but she sounded panicked and said she couldn't hear. A bearded and disheveled Holmes stared straight ahead as the calls were played and didn't show any emotion. Holmes also showed little emotion on Monday as police officers struggled to hold back tears during their testimony, reciting a litany of heartbreak: discovering a 6-year-old girl without a pulse, trying to keep a wounded man from jumping out of a moving police car to go back for his 7-year-old daughter, screaming at a gunshot victim not to die. \\"After I saw what I saw in the theater _ horrific _ I didn't want anyone else to die,\\" Grizzle said. Holmes watched intently as one detective showed a surveillance video of him calmly entering the theater lobby, holding the door open for a couple behind him, and printing out tickets to the midnight showing of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" that he purchased electronically nearly two weeks earlier. Authorities did not show a video of the attack but say Holmes, wearing body armor, tossed two gas canisters into the packed theater, then opened fire. The hearing will be the best opportunity yet for survivors to find out about Holmes' mental state and the sequence of events that led up to the attack. It comes weeks after a shooting at a Newtown, Conn., school killed 20 children and six adults and increased scrutiny on the combustible mix of firearms and mental illness. Holmes is charged with more than 160 counts, including murder and attempted murder. The hearing will allow the judge to determine whether the prosecution's case is strong enough to warrant a trial, but it's rare for a judge not to order a trial if a case gets this far. Legal analysts say that evidence appears to be so strong that Holmes' attorneys may seek a plea agreement before trial. While prosecutors have yet to decide on whether they will seek the death penalty, such a plea could get Holmes a lesser sentence, such as life in prison; help the state avoid a costly trial; and spare survivors and families of those who died from the trauma of going through a lengthy trial. ____ Associated Press writers Thomas Peipert and Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"An FBI explosives expert, Garrett Gumbinner, testified in a preliminary hearing in Centennial, Colorado, that mass murder suspect James Holmes rigged his apartment with an extensive array of homemade bombs, designed to cause significant damage and create a diversion from the July 20 shootings at a suburban Denver movie theatre that killed 12 and wounded or injured nearly 60 more. The explosive devices included homemade napalm, thermite, and glycerin combined with potassium permanganate, which would ignite a fire or explosion when mixed. Holmes had also set up a detonator outside of his Aurora apartment building. Gumbinner's testimony emphasized the elaborate planning Arapahoe County District prosecutors claim Holmes carried out in the premeditated massacre at Aurora's Century 16 Cineplex. The preliminary hearing determined if there was sufficient evidence to try Holmes on over 160 charges of first-degree murder and attempted murder. The courtroom heard about Holmes' online purchases of tactical gear, chemicals used in explosives, nearly 6,300 rounds of ammunition, and four weapons. All items were purchased legally at Denver area stores or through internet dealers from various locations. Holmes' defense attorneys argued that their 25-year-old client, a University of Colorado doctoral program dropout, suffers from mental illness and indicated they would employ an insanity defense. Prosecutors pushed to show that the attack was premeditated and that Holmes should stand trial. The hearing focused on the questions of whether Holmes was a calculated killer or if his actions were driven by mental illness."},{"prompt":"Since he had 30 minutes left on lunch, Lee decided to play tag with his friends.

The statement from the tour guides implies that the purpose of the red paste is to shield Hanuman from witnessing the more acrobatic than erotic carvings on the struts of the Jaganath Temple, which is located opposite to the temple in question. Hanuman is a central figure in Hindu mythology, revered for his strength, loyalty, and devotion. He is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva and is often associated with protection, righteousness, and victory over evil. In contrast, the carvings on the struts of the Jaganath Temple depict more acrobatic and erotic scenes, which might be considered as inappropriate and not in alignment with Hanuman's righteous nature. The red paste, as per the tour guides, is believed to act as a barrier that prevents Hanuman from seeing these carvings. This indicates that the red paste serves a functional and symbolic purpose, protecting the revered deity and preserving the sanctity of the temple. However, it's important to consider that the tour guides' explanation could be based on local folklore or cultural beliefs, without substantial evidence or historical background. Nonetheless, it remains a widely accepted interpretation of the use of red paste in this particular context, according to the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the red paste saves Hanuman from the sight on carvings on the struts of the Jaganath Temple appears to be true based on the tour guides' explanation and the cultural context surrounding this practice. However, it is crucial to acknowledge potential variations in interpreting this usage of red paste, as well as the reliance on tour guides' recounting of cultural beliefs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This statement in Finnish refers to a situation where the individual had to travel to Strasbourg ahead of time, specifically on Sundays, due to the given requirements. Despite this additional time spent, they were not compensated with a per diem allowance. A per diem allowance is a daily payment or allowance that is usually provided to employees who are traveling for work purposes. It is meant to cover living expenses such as meals, accommodation, and various incidental expenses while the employee is away from their workplace. The lack of per diem payment in this context implies that the person has to cover these additional expenses themselves, even though they had to put in extra time and effort to travel on Sunday. Strasbourg is a city in northeastern France, located near the border with Germany. It is well known for its historical and cultural heritage, including its medieval half-timbered houses, the ancient, Gothic cathedral, and picturesque canals. Strasbourg also has significant political importance due to being the official seat of the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, and the European Court of Human Rights. As a result, it is a common destination for people working on legislative, judicial, and diplomatic matters within the European Union. Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the individual had work obligations in Strasbourg, which necessitated their early arrival. However, the lack of compensation for this extra time and effort might have caused dissatisfaction or financial strain for the person, as they had to cover additional expenses on their Sunday trip.

Please answer the following question: Information: - In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving. - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others). - An oven is a thermally insulated chamber used for the heating, baking or drying of a substance, and most commonly used for cooking. Kilns and furnaces are special-purpose ovens, used in pottery and metalworking, respectively. - The Israelites (\\"Bnei Yisra'el\\") were a Semitic-speaking people of the ancient Near East, who inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods. The ancient Israelites are considered to be an outgrowth of the indigenous Canaanite populations that long inhabited the Southern Levant, Syria, ancient Israel and the Transjordan. - Hebrew (\\"\\" or ) is a language native to Israel, spoken by over 9 million people worldwide, of whom over 5 million are in Israel. Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh. The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE. Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. The Hebrew language is the only living Canaanite language left. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\" - A Cheder ( alternatively , Cheider , in Hebrew , meaning \`\` room '' ) is a traditional elementary school teaching the basics of Judaism and the Hebrew language . - The Torah (\\"instruction, teaching\\"), or in Christianity, the Pentateuch (\\"five books\\"), is the central reference of the religious Judaic tradition. It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice. Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws ('). - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized. - The Talmud (Hebrew: ' \\"instruction, learning\\", from a root ' \\"teach, study\\") is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism. It is also traditionally referred to as, a Hebrew abbreviation of ', the \\"six orders\\", a reference to the six orders of the Mishnah. The term \\"Talmud\\" normally refers to the collection of writings named specifically the Babylonian Talmud \\"(Talmud Bavli)\\", although there is also an earlier collection known as the Jerusalem Talmud, or Palestinian Talmud\\"' \\"(Talmud Yerushalmi)\\". When referring to post-biblical periods, namely those of the creation of the Talmud, the Talmudic academies and the Babylonian exilarchate, Jewish sources use the term \\"Babylonia\\" long after it had become obsolete in geopolitical terms. - The Tanakh (or ; also \\"Tenakh\\", \\"Tenak\\", \\"Tanach\\") or Mikra or Hebrew Bible is the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is also a textual source for the Christian Old Testament.

He takes one path --- Republicans = bad --- and keeps riding. That's fine at one level. As far as I can tell, most of the facts are correct. The problem is what's missing. What's missing is the Republicans long-standing support for science and engineering. Republican-controlled White Houses and Congresses have been equally supportive in terms of doling out money.Also what's missing is wacko Sen. Harkin (D-Iowa) and his assault on real science. He essentially created the alternative medicine institute at the National Institutes of Health, and he's been disappointed that real science can't validate wacko flower and faith healing. I would like to see a book called The Congressional War on Science that demonstrates the reason is scientific ignorance, not political ideology. Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review can be considered negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the author's perceived biases and points out what they believe is missing from the content. The reviewer appears to be open to reading about the subject matter, but feels that the book is not balanced and offers only a limited perspective. The reviewer criticizes the author for focusing only on the negatives associated with Republicans and not acknowledging their support for science and engineering. They also mention the absence of coverage on Democrats, such as Senator Harkin, who they believe have also contributed to the war on science due to their scientific ignorance. The reviewer suggests that a more inclusive and unbiased approach, exploring the reasons behind the war on science without attributing it solely to political ideology, would have been preferable.

Solve 289*x + 742*x - 15456 = -73*x for x.","completion":"Sure, I can help you with that. Let's solve it step by step. Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. 289*x and 742*x are like terms, so we'll add them together: 289*x + 742*x = 289x + 742x = 1031x Now the equation looks like: 1031x - 15456 = -73x Step 2: Move the -73x term to the left side of the equation. To do that, we need to add 73x to both sides of the equation: 1031x + 73x - 15456 = -73x + 73x This simplifies to: 1104x - 15456 = 0 Step 3: Move the constant term to the right side of the equation. To do that, we need to add 15456 to both sides: 1104x - 15456 + 15456 = 0 + 15456 This simplifies to: 1104x = 15456 Step 4: Solve for x. Now, we just have to divide both sides by 1104: 1104x / 1104 = 15456 / 1104 This simplifies to: x ≈ 14 So, the solution to the equation 289*x + 742*x - 15456 = -73*x is x ≈ 14."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a summary based on this article: PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Wednesday renamed its Pacific Command the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, in a largely symbolic move underscoring the growing importance of India to the Pentagon, U.S. officials said. U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis arrives to testify before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing on funding for the Department of Defense, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas U.S. Pacific Command, which is responsible for all U.S. military activity in the greater Pacific region, has about 375,000 civilian and military personnel assigned to its area of responsibility, which includes India. “Relationships with our Pacific and Indian Ocean allies and partners have proven critical to maintaining regional stability,” U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in prepared remarks. “In recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, today we rename the U.S. Pacific Command to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,” Mattis said. He was speaking during a change of command ceremony. Admiral Philip Davidson was assuming leadership of the command from Admiral Harry Harris, who is President Donald Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to South Korea. The renaming does not mean additional assets will be sent to the region at this time, but rather recognizes India’s increasing military relevance for the United States. In 2016, the United States and India signed an agreement governing the use of each other’s land, air and naval bases for repair and resupply, a step toward building defense ties as they seek to counter the growing maritime assertiveness of China. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said they had noted the name change. “We will continue to pay attention to developments,” he told a regular monthly news briefing. The United States is also keen to tap into India’s large defense market. It has emerged as India’s No. 2 weapons supplier, closing 15 billion worth of deals over the last decade. Mattis has been pushing for a waiver for countries like India, after Trump signed a law last year which said that any country trading with Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors would face sanctions. “I think India and the relationship with the United States is the potentially most historic opportunity we have in the 21st-century and I intend to pursue that quite rigorously,” Davidson, the incoming head of the command, said last month. However, experts said the name change would mean little unless it was tied to a broader strategy. “Renaming PACOM is ultimately a symbolic act ... (it) will have a very limited impact unless the U.S. follows through with a significant array of initiatives and investments that reflect a wider aperture,” said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under President Barack Obama. ||||| (CNN) The US announced Wednesday that it would rebrand the command responsible for overseeing US military operations in Asia, a move that comes amid heightened tensions with China over the militarization of the South China Sea. US Pacific Command will now be called US Indo-Pacific Command, Secretary of Defense James Mattis said while speaking at a change of command ceremony in Hawaii, where the command's headquarters is located. \\"In recognition of the increasing connectivity of the Indian and Pacific Oceans today we rename the US Pacific Command to US Indo-Pacific Command,\\" Mattis said. \\"It is our primary combatant command, it's standing watch and intimately engaged with over half of the earth's surface and its diverse populations, from Hollywood, to Bollywood, from polar bears to penguins,\\" Mattis said of the command. Adm. Harry Harris, who oversaw US military operations in the region until Wednesday, has been tapped by President Donald Trump to serve as the US ambassador to South Korea. Adm. Phillip Davidson will now lead the Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees some 375,000 US military and civilian personnel.

Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his... Answer:","completion":"Friedrich"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Jets got off to a fast start as returning running back Brandon Jacobs fumbled and the Jets' Kerry Rhodes returned it for a TD. The Giants responded with a 9-play, 67-yard drive ending in a touchdown run by Derrick Ward. However, the Giants defense, susceptible to third down conversions the first week of the season struggled again today and allowed the Jets to drive 93 yards late in the half for a 14-7 lead. The Jets were 3 for 3 on third down on the drive including some big catches by Laveranues Coles. Pennington hit Brad Smith for a 16-yard touchdown. After a bad interception from Eli Manning, the Jets added a field goal by Mike Nugent for a 17-7 halftime lead. The Giants fought back, going back to the ground game to start the second half. Plaxico Burress added a 25-yard completion from Manning and Jacobs pounded it in for a 19-yard touchdown. The Jets responded as Leon Washington ran 98 yards for a touchdown. Big Blue again fought back, driving 68 yards featuring a mix of runs and passes. Jeremy Shockey notched his first touchdown of the season with a 13-yard catch and run bringing the Giants within three after three quarters. The Jets responded with a drive of their own including several third down conversions but rookie Aaron Ross made the first of several big plays including a deep interception. The Giants drove 99 yards, which ended with a spectacular 53-yard touchdown catch and run by Plaxico Burress, who stiff-armed a Jet defender down the sideline. With the Jets driving for a score, Ross struck again, intercepting Pennington and returned it 43 yards to clinch the win. Brandon Jacobs notched his first ever 100-yard rushing performance, Manning managed 186 yards and 2 touchdowns despite a poor first half, Osi Umenyiora added a sack and Sam Madison added his first interception of the season. The Giants had now won four straight regular season meetings against the Jets and improved to 3-2 on the season. How many points did the Jets need to tie this game?","completion":"In this story, the Giants won the game with 35 points, while the Jets scored 24 points. So, if the Jets wanted to tie the game, they needed to have the same number of points as the Giants. Since the Giants had 35 points, the Jets needed 35 points too. To find out how many more points the Jets needed to tie, we can subtract the points they already had from the points they needed: 35 (points needed) - 24 (points they had) = 11 points. So, the Jets needed 11 more points to tie this game."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Charges can build up by friction. Maybe you rub your feet on a wool mat or carpet. Rubber soled shoes readily gain charges. The wool carpet easily gives up charges. The two items become unbalanced.

Movie title: The Baader Meinhof Complex Context: The film begins on a nude beach in Germany in the late 1960s, where we are introduced to Ulrike Meinhoff, a respected journalist, and her family. Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance. Rudi Dutschke is then almost assassinated by a man who is accused to be from the Springer Group, which is tied to the German Government. In effect, many activists go to the Springer Group headquarters and riot. As we see there are many demonstrating protesters rioting around the world, Baader and Ensslin are in court confessing about the department store fires.

Honey Salt was a 1 hour wait (1st choice), Cheesecake factory which was just across the street had a line out the door, so we called Poppy Den and the hostess said there was no wait, so up the block to Tivoli Village we went. We were seated in their back patio while the sun was setting which was very romantic. The restaurant is beautiful and very modern. I love all the decor, including the bathrooms! So, looking over the menu, I wanted the pork belly which I read on Yelp was fantastic! When our server came over, I told him that's what I wanted. He was kind of a jokester, so when he told me that they were using a different cut of pork which isn't pork belly and it's kind of tough and dry, I thought he was joking. So I just laughed and was like \\"no, really, I want the pork belly\\". But apparently, he wasn't joking. I don't know why they insisted on serving this \\"roasted pork belly\\" with a different cut of meat rather than just removing it from the menu for the night. That was kind of strange and tells me a lot about this restaurant, in a negative light. Thank goodness the server warned me. I ended up going with the duck which was cooked medium rare I do believe, while my husband ordered the cheeseburger with the kim cheese fries, grilled bok choy, and kim chee fried rice. The duck was... alright. It was definitely on the sweet side, and cooked medium rare, it was not that amazing. I'm used to eat duck confit, and Chinese roast duck. Compared to those, I'd say this was sub-par. They were just kind of sweet, extra chewy, pieces of duck breast. The grilled bok choy was a nice side. Having eaten boy choy many different ways growing up, grilling them was pretty unique, but the price was crazy. At a chinese market, you can buy 1lb of bok choy for probably 2. That would come with 10-15 spears. Here, you get 2-3 spears (they are all slices in half) for 7. I think I'll just grill my own bok choy at home next time. The kim chee fried rice tasted like any other kim chee fried rice I've had, and it came in a much smaller portion than I'm used to. My husband's burger was weird. There was WAY too much cheese on it, with a strange sauce, and pickled cucumbers (like ban chan cucumbers) that he just didn't like. He didn't even eat more than 1/4th of it. He hated the kim cheese sauce (he said it tasted like cheese sauce mixed with Sriricha) but the fries were okay (it's pretty hard to mess up fries). Overall, I'd say we won't be back.

Build a movie plot around this: What does April die from complications of? following the abortion","completion":"Title: \\"A Fragile Spring\\" Genre: Drama Synopsis: \\"A Fragile Spring\\" revolves around the themes of love, loss, and hope in a small town where a tragic incident unveils hidden truths and unravels the lives of its residents. April, a smart, introverted, and compassionate high school senior, comes face to face with the most challenging decisions in her life that send her down an unexpected and painful path. Act One: April, an intelligent yet introverted high school senior, is seemingly living a simple, uncomplicated life in a small rural town. She is an honors student with a close-knit circle of friends, including her best friend, Ruby. April lives with her loving single mother, Linda, who works tirelessly to provide for her. However, beneath the seemingly uncomplicated facade, April is pregnant, and the secret is eating her up inside. The father of the unborn child is none other than her boyfriend, Charlie, the charming and popular captain of the football team. In the beginning, she coyly tries to deal with the swirl of emotions by herself, but Ruby quickly takes notice and helps her confide in Linda. Act Two: Overwhelmed and desperate, April's world takes a dark turn as she struggles with her emotions, the stigma attached to teen pregnancies in her conservative town, and her uncertain future. After deep conversations with her mother, Ruby, and Charlie, April makes the heart-wrenching decision to have an abortion. However, things take an unexpected turn, when April reveals her decision to Charlie. Her boyfriend feels guilty and tries to talk the couple into keeping the baby, but at last, Charlie accepts April's decision. In the heart of this act, we witness the interaction of these characters and their emotions towards this life-changing decision. Having made the gut-wrenching decision, April undergoes the abortion procedure with Linda and Ruby's unwavering support. The procedure seems to go smoothly, and April is relieved to put this chapter behind her. Charlie, on the other hand, feels conflicted and distances himself from April, unable to cope with his feelings of guilt. Act Three: Unfortunately, April's story takes a tragic turn when she begins to experience severe pain and health complications shortly after the abortion procedure. April's desperate mother and close friends try to support her, but as they rushed to the emergency room to her worsening physical condition, April couldn't survive and quietly passed away due to unforeseen complications related to the abortion. As the news of her death spreads, the small town of residents is thrown into chaos, shock, and disbelief. April's death unveils hidden secrets of other girls in the town who experienced the same difficulty in their life but kept the truth hidden. Everyone begins to reassess their values, prejudices, and the hurt caused by keeping secrets. Charlie, who feels tormented by April's death, joins a support group and starts advocating for better sexual education and awareness. Despite the loss, April's death serves as a catalyst for change in the small town as town members start to mend relationships, seek forgiveness, and advocate for better healthcare and understanding for young girls experiencing similar struggles. Conclusion: \\"A Fragile Spring\\" is a deeply moving story that showcases the tragedy and despair that can be brought about by certain decisions, along with the hope and change that can be born out of loss. The film would blend elements of romance, friendship, and tragedy, creating a heart-wrenching and powerful exploration of the importance of love, support, and understanding in the journey of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there could be a slight difference in the perspective of each question, primarily in the intent and methods implied. The first question might suggest generating income quickly in a broader sense, while the second question could emphasize on finding a method to instantly or rapidly earn money. Nonetheless, they both share the common goal of seeking quick monetary gains. To answer both questions, I will provide a detailed and long explanation of various methods to generate income quickly. 1. Freelancing: Offering your skills as a freelancer can help you make money fast. Platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr allow you to offer specialized services like writing, designing, programming, or marketing. As you build a solid reputation and gather positive reviews, you can raise your rates and secure more work. 2. Gig Economy: Take advantage of the growing gig economy by working for companies like Uber, Lyft, or DoorDash. These platforms allow you to earn money based on the hours you're willing to work and can provide considerable earning potential for people who are willing to put in the time. 3. Online Tutoring: If you have expertise in a certain subject, you can offer your services as an online tutor. Websites such as Tutor.com, Chegg, and VIPKid enable you to teach students from around the world and offer competitive pay rates. 4. Selling Items Online: Websites like eBay, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace allow you to sell unwanted items and earn quick cash. Additionally, creating and selling handmade items on Etsy or selling digital products on sites like Gumroad and Creative Market allows you to tap into niche markets and generate instant income. 5. Affiliate Marketing: By partnering with certain companies and promoting their products or services, you can earn a commission on every sale made through your unique referral link. Websites like Amazon Associates, Commission Junction, and ShareASale can connect you with relevant businesses in your niche. 6. Online Surveys and Market Research: Websites like Survey Junkie, Swagbucks, and Mechanical Turk pay you for completing online surveys, watching videos, or performing other small tasks. While it may not be the highest-paying option, it can provide consistent cash flow if you dedicate enough time to it. 7. Renting Out Assets: If you have extra space in your home or an unused vehicle, you can utilize platforms like Airbnb, VRBO, or Turo to rent these assets out to others, generating additional income with minimal effort required. 8. Peer-to-Peer Lending: By investing in peer-to-peer lending platforms such as LendingClub and Prosper, you can lend money to individuals or businesses, earning interest on loans that borrowers repay. This method requires some initial investment but can result in a continuous stream of income. 9. Short-term Investments: While not without risks, trading stocks, options, or cryptocurrencies can potentially yield quick profits. You'll need to carefully research investments and have a clear understanding of your risk tolerance before attempting these methods. 10. Offering Local Services: Providing services such as babysitting, dog walking, or lawn mowing within your community can be a source of immediate income. You can advertise your services on local online community boards, social media, or through word-of-mouth. Remember, not all of these methods guarantee instant wealth and may take some time to produce substantial income.

Article: Once upon a time if we wanted to make a phone call or wait for someone to contact us, we had to sit at home or at our desks. There were public phones in the street of course, _ . And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not? Because the worrying thing is we can't live without our phones. We've become communication addicts, unable to spend even a few minutes out of contact, in case we miss something 'important'.

To qualify this, I’m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies.

Title: Von Richthofen and Brown Movie plot: Manfred von Richthofen (John Phillip Law) is a German cavalry officer newly assigned to an air squadron under the command of Oswald Boelcke (Peter Masterson). Richthofen quickly becomes an ace; his career is presented as a series of scenes intercut with those of another pilot across the lines, a Canadian named Roy Brown (Don Stroud), who arrives at a British squadron commanded by Victoria Cross holder Lanoe Hawker (Corin Redgrave). The two pilots are very different; Brown ruffles the feathers of his squadron mates by refusing to drink a toast to Richthofen, while the Baron awards himself silver trophies in honour of his kills, and clashes with fellow pilot Hermann GÃ¶ring (Barry Primus) when Boelcke is killed after a mid-air collision and Richthofen assumes command of the squadron. Richthofen becomes outwardly energized by the war. Outraged by an order to camouflage his squadron's aircraft, he paints them in bright conspicuous colours, claiming that gentlemen should not hide from their enemies. The toll on both squadrons is highlighted when Richthofen is wounded during an aerial battle and Lanoe Hawker is killed. The war becomes personal for both when Brown and his squadron attack Richthofen's airfield, destroying their aircraft on the ground. Revenge comes when Richthofen, with the help of a batch of new fighters from Anthony Fokker (Hurd Hatfield) launches a counterattack on the British airfield. Back at their aerodrome, Richthofen rants at GÃ¶ring for leaving the formation and strafing medical personnel. He says: \\"You're an assassin!\\" GÃ¶ring defends himself by saying: \\"I make war to win.\\" Richthofen tells him: \\"Get out of my sight!\\", threatening that if GÃ¶ring does something similar again, he will personally go to the Kaiser to make sure Goring is shot. Richthofen's passion for the war fades, becoming dismayed and depressed that his squadron is losing so many pilots. He even starts to realize that Germany might lose the war.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves. suppose more conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more resources filling the pores occurs. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in the given scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand this, let's first analyze the process mentioned: The process you are referring to is photosynthesis, which is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments. Photosynthesis involves converting light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This process can be summarized as follows: 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the leaves through small pores called stomata. 2. Water (H2O) is absorbed by the roots from the soil and transported through vessels in the stem to reach the leaves. 3. Sunlight is absorbed by the green pigment chlorophyll present in the leaves. 4. The absorbed light energy is used to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) through a series of biochemical reactions. Now, let's consider the situation where more conservation occurs and how it affects resources filling the pores: If more conservation efforts are made, it is likely that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere might reduce due to decreased human activities like deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. This would, in turn, affect the amount of CO2 available for the plant's photosynthesis process. Additionally, conservation may also contribute to an improved water supply, which could influence root absorption and water transport to the leaves. Furthermore, indirect factors such as temperature and humidity may also be impacted by conservation efforts. For instance, improved forest cover due to conservation efforts would consequently impact the microclimate of the area, which could indirectly affect photosynthesis rates. As the resources filling the pores (CO2) are impacted and other environmental conditions are changed by conservation efforts, it implies that the perturbation is indirectly impacting the steps of the photosynthesis process. The perturbation is not directly altering a specific step in the process, but rather affecting the availability of resources, both directly (CO2 availability) and indirectly (water availability and microclimatic conditions), which, in turn, influence photosynthesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

Menachem Begin ( listen ; Hebrew: m@nakhem be'giyn Menahem Begin, Polish: Mieczyslaw Biegun; Russian: Menakhem Vol'fovich Begin Menakhem Volfovich Begin; 16 August 1913 - 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel. On 17 May 1977 the Likud, headed by Begin, won the Knesset elections by a landslide, becoming the biggest party in the Knesset. Popularly known as the Mahapakh (\\"upheaval\\"), the election results had seismic ramifications as for the first time in Israeli history a party other than the Alignment/Mapai was in a position to form a government, effectively ending the left's hitherto unrivalled domination over Israeli politics. Likud's electoral victory signified a fundamental restructuring of Israeli society in which the founding socialist Ashkenazi elite was being replaced by a coalition representing marginalized Mizrahi and Jewish-religious communities, promoting a socially conservative and economically liberal agenda. The Likud campaign leading up to the election centered on Begin's personality. Demonized by the Alignment as totalitarian and extremist, his self-portrayal as a humble and pious leader struck a chord with many who felt abandoned by the ruling party's ideology. In the predominantly Jewish Mizrahi working class urban neighborhoods and peripheral towns, the Likud won overwhelming majorities, while disillusionment with the Alignment's corruption prompted many middle and upper class voters to support the newly founded centrist Democratic Movement for Change (\\"Dash\\") headed by Yigael Yadin. Dash won 15 seats out of 120, largely at the expense of the Alignment, which was led by Shimon Peres and had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats. Well aware of his momentous achievement and employing his trademark sense for drama, when speaking that night in the Likud headquarters Begin quoted from the Gettysburg Address and the Torah, referring to his victory as a 'turning point in the history of the Jewish people'. With 43 seats, the Likud still required the support of other parties in order to reach a parliamentary majority that would enable it to form a government under Israel's proportionate representation parliamentary system. Though able to form a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and ultra-orthodox parties, Begin also sought support from centrist elements in the Knesset to provide his government with greater public legitimacy. He controversially offered the foreign affairs portfolio to Moshe Dayan, a former IDF Chief of Staff and Defense Minister, and a prominent Alignment politician identified with the old establishment. Begin was sworn in as Prime Minister of Israel on 20 June 1977. Dash eventually joined his government several months later, thus providing it with the broad support of almost two thirds of the Knesset. While Prime Minister, Yehuda Avner served as Begin's speech writer.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what happened in 1977?","completion":"In 1977, a significant political transformation occurred in Israel. On 17 May 1977 the Likud, a right-wing political faction led by Menachem Begin, emerged triumphant in the Knesset elections by a large margin, effectively ending the longstanding dominance of the left-wing Alignment/Mapai party. This event, widely referred to as the Mahapakh or \\"upheaval\\", drastically altered the political landscape as it marked the first time a party other than the Alignment/Mapai had won the ability to form a government. The success of the Likud represented a fundamental shift in Israeli society – one that saw the displacement of the incumbent socialist Ashkenazi elite by a coalition whose primary constituents were the previously marginalized Mizrahi and Jewish-religious communities. The Likud went into the election campaigning in a manner that placed heavy emphasis on Begin's modest and pious personality, which resonated with many Israeli citizens who felt neglected by the ruling party's agenda. In areas heavily populated by Jewish Mizrahi working-class individuals, as well as in peripheral towns, the Likud won decisive victories. Meanwhile, disillusionment with the reported corruption of the Alignment also led to many middle and upper-class voters turning to the newly founded centrist Democratic Movement for Change (\\"Dash\\") led by Yigael Yadin. As a result of this shift, the Alignment, led by Shimon Peres, saw its representation decrease from 51 to 32 seats. Aware of the historical significance of his victory, Begin, known for his flair for theatricality, compared his victory to the turning points mentioned in the Gettysburg Address and the Torah. He declared the electoral outcome as a 'turning point in the history of the Jewish people'. Despite winning 43 seats, the Likud was still in need of additional support from other factions to reach a parliamentary majority. To this end, although it formed a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and ultra-orthodox groups, Begin sought to increase his government's public credibility by extending his coalition to include centrist elements from the Knesset. In a controversial move, he offered the position of Foreign Affairs Portfolio to Moshe Dayan, a former IDF Chief of Staff and Defense Minister affiliated with the ousted establishment. Begin was officially inaugurated as the Prime Minister of Israel on 20 June 1977. A few months later, the Democratic Movement for Change (\\"Dash\\") also joined Begin's government, aligning almost two-thirds of the Knesset with his government. Yehuda Avner served as Begin's speechwriter during his tenure as Prime Minister.

A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low. and a hint : When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube.

What is the answer for the question: What position at the paper would Henry be leaving if he went to work at the New York Sentinel? from the following article ? The film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the metro editor of the New York Sun, a fictional New York City tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of experiencing the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. The paper's owner, Graham Keighley, faces dire financial straits, so he has Alicia Clark, the managing editor and Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's wife Martha, a fellow Sun reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she really dislikes Alicia Clark. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the Sun and become an assistant managing editor at the New York Sentinel, another fictional newspaper (based on The New York Times), which would mean more money, shorter hours, and more respectability, but might also be a bit boring for his tastes. Minor subplots involve Alicia, Bernie, and Sun columnist Michael McDougal. McDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar (later in the film) leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall. Alicia, who is having an affair with Sun reporter Carl and has expensive tastes, schemes to get a raise in her salary.

Unless your family physician is also an ear, nose, mouth specialist (otolaryngologist), then your dentist may be the better bet to start with because they can rule out any non-cancerous mouth problems more readily and then treat them to relieve your discomfort. In addition to a mouth exam (including your lips, cheeks, tongue, gums, tonsils and throat) your neck, ears, and nose should also be looked at to determine the cause of your problem. Your doctor or dentist will also ask you about risky behaviors (tobacco smoking and alcohol use) and your family history, as some cancers have a genetic link. Be aware that people over 40 years of age, especially if they are male and of African American descent, are considered at higher risk for oral cancers. Along with an exam of your mouth and throat, some dentists or doctors may use special oral dyes to better visualize abnormal areas in your mouth, especially if you are considered at higher risk for oral cancer. For example, one method uses a dye called toluidine blue. Putting toluidine blue dye over a cancerous area in your mouth will make the diseased tissue stain a darker blue than surrounding healthy tissue. Sometimes infected or injured tissue also stains dark blue, so it's not a definitive test for cancer, just a visual guide. To be sure of cancer, a tissue sample (biopsy) needs to be taken and looked at under a microscope by a cancer specialist. This way you can get an accurate diagnosis. Another method of trying to distinguish healthy tissue from cancerous tissue in the mouth is by using special lasers. In general, when laser light is reflected off abnormal tissue, it looks different (duller) from light reflected off normal tissue. Another method uses a special fluorescent light to view the mouth after it's been rinsed with an acetic acid solution (vinegar, basically). Again the cancerous tissue stands out. If an abnormal area of the mouth is suspected, a tissue biopsy is usually performed. Alternatively, sometimes the abnormal tissue can be evaluated by exfoliative cytology, where the suspected lesion is scraped with a stiff brush and the cells looked at microscopically. Summary:","completion":"If you have a problem in your mouth that lasts more than two weeks, you should go see a doctor or dentist. They will look at your mouth, ears, nose, and neck to find out what's wrong. If they think you might have mouth cancer, they can use special dyes, lasers, or lights to see the bad area better. To be sure if it's cancer, they might have to take a tiny piece of the tissue and look at it under a microscope. It's important to talk to your doctor about any problems in your mouth, especially if you're an older person or have risk factors like smoking or a family history of cancer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you go to a sports game, a concert, or a bar in hopes of meeting someone in person, be bold. If approaching someone you're interested in isn't really your style, you can still make yourself look approachable and inviting. If you see someone you’re interested in, but you can’t come up with a pickup line or a conversation starter, buy a drink for them and ask the bartender to tell them it’s from you. It’s hard to go wrong with a simple, kind gesture. Make eye contact, smile, and raise your eyebrows – you just might make a connection from across the room. A lot of people who swear they hate dating probably only hate small talk. However, if you establish common ground through casual chatting, you’ll be able to discuss more serious topics, and the overall conversation will flow a lot more smoothly. Ask broad, open-ended questions. Something like \\"So what got you interested in rock-climbing?\\" is a lot better than \\"Are you interested in rock-climbing?\\" If you meet in person, talk about where you are and what you're doing there. If you happen to meet someone playing beach volleyball, say something like: \\"Wow, you're really good. I'll know where to come in the future if I want my butt kicked. Do you play here often?\\" Relate to what the other person said. If they gripe about getting to work and you, too, have a difficult commute, express your shared frustration and tell them why you hate driving (or taking the bus or train). Nervous mistakes are simply a part of dating. You might trip over your words and say something you think is utterly stupid, or make an embarrassing typo while messaging on a dating app. Instead of taking yourself too seriously and letting the awkward moment get to you, try making a joke at your own expense. Luckily, some people think it's cute if their date is a little nervous. Don't go out with anyone who shows mild interest in you. People who are more discriminating tend to be seen as more desirable, and having standards shows that you value yourself and your time. On the other hand, if you keep holding out for the perfect person, you might miss out on a great connection. If you're in a room full of people with similar interests, you should be able to pick out one or two people who you'd like to go on a date with. Make it a point to not leave an event without showing interest, making a connection, or trading phone numbers with a few people. While swiping on an app like Tinder, take time to consider each potential match carefully, rather than turning them down based on an immediate gut reaction. Remember that there’s a real person behind that profile, and that you might make a great connection with them even if you’re not blown away by their photos. Treat people the way you would wish to be treated, online and off. If you start to suspect the person you’re talking to might not be right for you, they still might want to go out with you. If they ask you out and you’d rather not go, avoid making excuses like \\"I'm busy\\" or \\"I'm not ready to date right now.\\" These small lies can be more hurtful and insulting than just respectfully declining. Smile, say \\"No thanks, but I appreciate the offer\\", and change the subject to ease any discomfort. If you think your first interaction has gone well, ask the person out. By this time, you should have a good idea of what your potential date is interested in, or what they like to do for fun. Invite them to do something you think you would both enjoy. If your date is lukewarm about trying new restaurants or bars, suggest a casual activity that’s relevant to what you’ve talked about with the other person instead of a dinner date. For instance, if they mentioned that they like a certain style of music, invite them to a concert you think they would enjoy. Have a good idea of what you’re going to say to the person so you don’t stumble over your words, but don’t memorize a statement ahead of time – you don’t want to sound scripted. Be polite and graceful if they say no. Even if you feel hurt or disappointed, try not to take their answer personally. Thank them for being honest with you and tell them you enjoyed meeting them.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select from the following. - heating liquids - clouds - smog - emissions - less ozone - gravity - sun's heat - photons Given those answer options, answer the question: Fact 1: Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. Fact 2: Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation. Given the two facts above, what increases ultraviolet light? A:","completion":"The increase in ultraviolet (UV) light is caused by the depletion of the ozone layer. The ozone layer, part of Earth's stratosphere, is rich in ozone (O3) which is a type of molecule that includes three oxygen atoms. This layer plays a crucial role by protecting Earth from the Sun's harmful UV radiation. The reason the ozone layer is so valuable is because of its ability to absorb the majority of the Sun's high-energy ultraviolet radiation—specifically, UV-B and UV-C. UV radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes various types of energy emanated from the Sun. While some amounts of UV-A radiation reach the ground level, the majority of UV-B and all UV-C radiation are absorbed by the ozone layer, ensuring the biological safety of living organisms on Earth. When the ozone layer becomes thinner or when holes appear in it, which commonly happens over poles—particularly the South Pole—more UV radiation can get through. This phenomenon is known as ozone depletions. Ozone depletion is largely caused by the release of certain industrial chemicals, namely chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which can persist in the atmosphere for a long time. When these chemicals reach the stratosphere, due to weather patterns or natural atmospheric movement, they can catalyze the breakdown of ozone molecules, reducing the layer's protective capacity. In particular, under the influence of sunlight, CFCs can break down to release chlorine atoms. These chlorine atoms are capable of catalyzing the breakdown of ozone, resulting in a decrease in ozone high in the stratosphere. Over time, this process results in thinning of the ozone layer or ozone \\"holes\\". With less ozone in the atmosphere to absorb the UV radiation, higher quantities of this harmful radiation can reach the Earth's surface. Increased UV-B radiation at the Earth's surface is harmful to the DNA of all living organisms, leading to skin cancers and cataracts in humans, reduced crop yield, damage to phytoplankton (which forms the base of the ocean's food chain), and other detrimental effects. To summarize, the increase in ultraviolet light that reaches the Earth's surface is a direct result of the depletion of the ozone layer. This depletion is primarily driven by the emission of chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons that trigger the breakdown of ozone molecules in the stratosphere, thereby reducing the protective capacity of the ozone layer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So we have 47*u and 20*u, and when we add them together, we get 67*u. So the equation becomes: 143*u - 1444 = 67*u 2. Now, we need to move all the \\"u\\" terms to one side of the equation. To do that, we will subtract 67*u from both sides. So we have: 143*u - 67*u - 1444 = 0 3. When we subtract 67*u from 143*u, we get 76*u. So the equation is now: 76*u - 1444 = 0 4. To find the value of \\"u,\\" we need to move the number -1444 to the other side of the equation. We will do this by adding 1444 to both sides: 76*u = 1444 5.

Possible A: england, europe, city, new jersey, interstate Why is \\"new jersey\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"New Jersey\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because: 1. Context: The question asks about a specific location where motorways are likely to have tolls. New Jersey, being a U.S. state, has a well-developed highway system that includes multiple toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. 2. Comparison: When compared to the other possible answers - England and Europe are both broader geographical locations, whereas \\"city\\" is a general term for an urban area, and \\"interstate\\" refers to a type of highway system in the United States. In this context, New Jersey serves as a more specific and identifiable location where toll roads can be found. 3. Practicality: Toll roads are often put in place to help generate revenue for maintaining and improving transportation infrastructure. New Jersey, being a densely populated state with significant commuter traffic, would stand to benefit from having tolls on its motorways in order to fund improvements and maintenance for its infrastructure. 4. Real-world examples: There are well-known toll roads in New Jersey, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, which are familiar to people from the area or who have traveled through the state. This real-world example of tolls in New Jersey aligns with human common sense, as people can easily recall or verify the presence of toll roads in the state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Herkelman, who was 20-13 entering the tournament, and fellow 112-pounder Ottumwa sophomore Megan Black, who was 25-13, made history by being the first girls to qualify for the state tournament. Black was pinned quickly in her opening round match. \\"I have a tremendous amount of respect for Cassy and Megan and their accomplishments. However, wrestling is a combat sport and it can get violent at times,\\" wrote Northrup. \\"As a matter of conscience and my faith I do not believe that it is appropriate for a boy to engage a girl in this manner.

Write highlights for this article: It is the scourge of schoolchildren up and down the country. Classes can often be heard letting out a collective groan when the teacher mentions homework, ruining plans for a night watching films or playing out with friends. However, this will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk - because it has decided to ban all homework. Good news: Homework will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk - because it has decided to ban it. This picture is posed by models. Instead, the 1100 children who will attend the Jane Austen Academy in Norwich will do longer days at school. The mixed free school for 11-18-year-olds - which will specialise in English and the humanities - is set to open in September 2014. The school yesterday unveiled its prospective principal, Claire Heald, who said that city children would do extra study at school as part of the extended day, which could last until about 5pm. She said: 'Rather than setting homework that pupils could go home and struggle with at home, and where there may be limited access to computers, they will do that as independent study in the day. 'We are saying that when they go home they should enjoy quality family time. 'There will not be any traditional homework - and that has been really well received by parents who respect the fact that family time will be family time.' New approach: The 1100 students who will attend the Jane Austen Academy will do longer days at school. The school's prospective principal, Claire Heald, is pictured. But Ms Heald said the school would still expect youngsters to study at home ahead of crucial exams. She's ready to create a new dramatic template in the UK after French president Francois Hollande called for the end of homework in primary schools last October. The French leader insisted independent learning at school would enhance equality because kids who get help with homework from parents have a huge head start. Since their introduction by the Coalition, dozens of free schools have opened - with many others in the pipeline. But they have proved controversial, with many providing alternative methods of teaching and education. At the Tiger Primary School in Maidstone, pupils have all-singing and all-dancing curriculum. Pupils have specialist teachers for Mandarin, music, gym, dance and games lessons. They also have access to a school farm and ecology woodland. Pupils at the Greenwich Free School in London spend a third more time learning than most school children. The school day lasts from 8am to 5.30pm. There are only 100 pupils in each year, which the school says means teachers get to know each pupil as an individual. The exciting initiative has already sparked keen interest from other headteachers in Norfolk. Peter Devonish, headteacher of Neatherd High School in Dereham, said: 'My initial thought is that it's really compelling. 'It sounds like a really good idea. 'Having the children on site a bit longer to consolidate their learning is a really good idea. 'The children can finish work and they can have their time with the family.'

'If you are a free school you do not have to conform in the same way.'

'And if they are starting a new school then it gives them the chance to try out new things.' He added: 'A large problem with homework, which we have tackled, has been that not enough is done with it.

The new administration had already begun exploring possible diplomatic options, retracing many of the paths traveled by its predecessors.U.S. envoys again pressed the Taliban to turn Bin Laden \\"over to a country where he could face justice\\" and repeated, yet again, the warning that the Taliban would be held responsible for any al Qaeda attacks on U.S. interests. The Taliban's representatives repeated their old arguments. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told us that while U.S. diplomats were becoming more active on Afghanistan through the spring and summer of 2001, \\"it would be wrong for anyone to characterize this as a dramatic shift from the previous administration.\\" In deputies meetings at the end of June, Tenet was tasked to assess the prospects forTaliban cooperation with the United States on al Qaeda. The NSC staff was tasked to flesh out options for dealing with the Taliban. Revisiting these issues tried the patience of some of the officials who felt they had already been down these roads and who found the NSC's procedures slow.\\" We weren't going fast enough,\\"Armitage told us. Clarke kept arguing that moves against the Taliban and al Qaeda should not have to wait months for a larger review of U.S. policy in South Asia.\\" For the government,\\" Hadley said to us,\\"we moved it along as fast as we could move it along.\\" As all hope in moving the Taliban faded, debate revived about giving covert assistance to the regime's opponents. Clarke and the CIA's Cofer Black renewed the push to aid the Northern Alliance. Clarke suggested starting with modest aid, just enough to keep the Northern Alliance in the fight and tie down al Qaeda terrorists, without aiming to overthrow the Taliban. Rice, Hadley, and the NSC staff member for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, told us they opposed giving aid to the Northern Alliance alone. They argued that the program needed to have a big part for Pashtun opponents of theTaliban. They also thought the program should be conducted on a larger scale than had been suggested. Clarke concurred with the idea of a larger program, but he warned that delay risked the Northern Alliance's final defeat at the hands of the Taliban. During the spring, the CIA, at the NSC's request, had developed draft legal authorities-a presidential finding-to undertake a large-scale program of covert assistance to the Taliban's foes.

I had reservations for a Saturday night dinner with my friends and the moment we walked into the door, we were warmly greeted by the attentive and courteous staff. The atmosphere inside is cozy and inviting, with soft lighting and elegant decorations that truly enhanced the ambiance. As we settled in, our knowledgeable server, Julie, took the time to walk us through the menu, sharing details about the ingredients, preparation methods, and her personal recommendations. We eagerly took her suggestions and were not disappointed in the slightest. For starters, we shared the artisanal charcuterie board which was a beautiful assortment of meats, cheeses, olives and bread that truly helped set the stage for what was to come. We also sampled the perfectly crispy, golden calamari, served with a tangy lemon aioli that only elevated the flavors even further. You may think our expectations were already high by then, but our main courses managed to impress us even more. I opted for the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, which was cooked to perfection, flaky and tender, and served over a bed of creamy risotto with seasonal vegetables. The delicate flavors were enhanced by the white wine lemon butter sauce, and I savored every last bite. My friends raved about their dishes too - the filet mignon, cooked exactly as requested and so tender it melted in your mouth, and signature truffled mushroom pasta, that provided a delightful symphony of creamy, savory, and umami-filled flavors. To crown our evening, we treated ourselves to a dessert like no other – the much-recommended chocolate lava cake accompanied by a scoop of velvety vanilla ice cream. It was a truly delectable and indulgent way to conclude a fantastic meal. Throughout the evening, the service remained impeccable. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, anticipated our needs, and expertly balanced professionalism with friendliness. Their infectious smiles and genuine enthusiasm made us feel special and welcomed, like we were dear friends returning to their home for a memorable meal. I cannot recommend La Gourmet Delights enough. From their outstanding menu, amazing culinary craftsmanship, world-class service to the charming atmosphere, every aspect of our experience was a sheer joy. We've already made our reservations for a return visit, and I know it won't be our last.

This can be attributed to Dowding being summoned to an Air Ministry conference on 17 October 1940 to explain the poor state of night defences and the supposed failure of his daytime strategy. The criticism of his leadership extended far beyond the Air Council, and both Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill themselves appeared to be distancing themselves from Dowding. The failure of night defence preparation was, in fact, not the sole responsibility of the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) to accrue resources. The general neglect of the Royal Air Force (RAF) until the late surge in 1938 left minimal resources available to build defences. While it was reasonable for people to disagree with Dowding's operational and tactical deployment of forces, it should be noted that the ultimate responsibility for the failure to allocate resources fell on the government and the Air Ministry at large. During the pre-war period, the Chamberlain Government had stated that night defence against air attacks should not consume a significant amount of national effort. Both the government and the Air Ministry did not make it a priority. This context highlights how the waning support from Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill can be seen as somewhat unfounded, given that the responsibility for the shortcomings in night defence should have been shouldered more broadly by civil and military institutions, rather than laid solely at Dowding's feet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Railway electrification system: Modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and converted to a DC voltage to be used by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for. What type of losses happen during conversion and transmission in wires and electronics?","completion":"During the conversion and transmission of electricity in wires and electronics, two main types of losses happen. First, there are \\"ohmic losses,\\" which happen in the wires due to the resistance of the materials being used. This means that when electricity flows through the wires, some of it turns into heat and is not used for making the train move. Second, there are \\"magnetic field losses.\\" These happen in transformers and devices called smoothing reactors or inductors. Transformers and inductors help change electricity from one format to another, but while doing that, some of the energy gets lost in their magnetic fields and becomes heat too. So, both kinds of losses, ohmic and magnetic, mean that not all the energy taken from the power grid is used to make the train move as some of it turns into heat during the conversion and transmission processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step by step, I proceeded cautiously, despite my initial carelessness. Step 1: Check for any security protocols in place. I had to ensure that I wouldn't raise any alarms while accessing the network using my accomplice's ID. Step 2: Establish a secure connection with the access point. This was essential to prevent any potential eavesdroppers or hackers from monitoring my activities. Step 3: Navigate the network with the purpose of gathering valuable information and resources. I carefully sifted through the data, looking for anything that could be of use to me. Step 4: Cover my tracks. It was important to erase any traces of my presence to avoid drawing unwanted attention to the abandoned house or jeopardizing my accomplice's identity. As I immersed myself in the network, I was astounded by the sheer amount of information at my fingertips.

Answer the following question: If weathering grinds rocks down, then what grinds rocks over time? Answer choices: - deltas - erosion - Time and energy - weathering - Echinoderm. - deuterostomes - amoebae - bullfrogs Answer:","completion":"The process that grinds rocks over time is known as weathering and erosion. These are two environmental processes that break down the larger rocks into smaller particles. Weathering is the process where rocks and minerals on Earth's surface are broken down into smaller pieces or worn away. The process of weathering can transpire through physical or mechanical processes such as temperature change, frost, rainfall, wind, and the activities of organisms. It can also occur chemically when rocks interact with water, air, or certain substances in the environment. For example, acid rain can cause the weathering of rocks. This process helps in grinding the rocks but doesn't displace them from their original location. Over time, once the weathering process has broken down the rocks into smaller pieces, erosion then acts as nature's way of moving the sediments. Erosion is the transport of the weathered materials to different locations. Agents of erosion include water, wind, ice, or gravity. For instance, a river tends to carry along weathered rock particles and deposit them when the speed of the current slows. This process is a significant reason behind the formation of deltas mentioned in the answer choices. Similarly, glacial movements can erode large chunks of landscape and carve paths through mountains. In this context, time and energy also play roles as time defines how long the action of weathering and erosion has occurred, while energy describes the forces involved like the wind's speed, the water's flow rate, and the gravity's pull. However, the other answer choices such as Echinoderm, deuterostomes, amoebae, and bullfrogs are not involved in the process of grinding rocks over time. These are different types of organisms. Echinoderm and deuterostomes refer to specific phyla in the animal kingdom, including starfish and sea urchins for Echinoderm; some members of this group can somewhat break or grind down rocks, but this is minimal compared to weathering and erosion. Amoebae are single-celled organisms and bullfrogs are a type of amphibian; although they may have minimal impact on their immediate environment through dwelling habits, they don't play a significant role in grinding rocks over geological timescales. To summarize, weathering and erosion are the primary processes that grind rocks over time, and this happens over an extended period due to the energy put into the system. Other organisms and features may contribute to the transformation of the Earth's surface, but their impact is usually minor compared to these geophysical phenomena."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a premise: well we really can't we really don't do that that often um i i guess recently we did um Here is a hypothesis: Yes of course we can do that and we do this often. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To thoroughly assess the possibility of concluding that if the given premise is true, the hypothesis is also true, it is crucial to analyze both premise and hypothesis contextually and logically. Premise: \\"Well we really can't, we really don't do that that often, um, I guess recently we did um.\\" The premise indicates that the speakers rarely perform a certain activity or task; however, they admit doing it recently. The vague language and filler words like \\"um\\" signify uncertainty or a lack of clarity regarding the details of the activity. Hypothesis: \\"Yes, of course we can do that, and we do this often.\\" The hypothesis states that the speakers are not only capable of performing the same activity, but they also do it frequently. The tone of the hypothesis is confident and affirmative, which contradicts the uncertainty in the premise. In analyzing the given information, it becomes clear that there is a significant contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis: 1. The premise suggests that the activity is performed infrequently, while the hypothesis claims the opposite, i.e., it is being performed often. 2. The tone of the premise is unclear, and the speakers seem to be uncertain about the activity, while the hypothesis is assertive and confident about the ability and frequency of performing the activity. Considering these critical discrepancies, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true. In fact, a truthful premise would indicate that the hypothesis is more likely to be false. In sum, the premise and the hypothesis are logically inconsistent, which prevents the drawing of a definitive conclusion that would solidify the truthfulness of both statements."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Desperate for a cure, he visits countless doctors and alternative healers, but to no avail. One day, a mysterious old man tells him about a distant island where the inhabitants possess the secret cure for sore throats. Intrigued and desperate, Jake sets sail on a treacherous journey to find the elusive island. Upon arrival, Jake meets the Islanders and learns about their unusual and somewhat disturbing sore throat cure. The Islanders catch wild toads and place them in their mouths for a few minutes, transferring the toad's magical essence to the person in need. Despite his reservations, Jake decides to give it a try, and, to his astonishment, his sore throat disappears within minutes. Word spreads about Jake's extraordinary recovery, and soon the Islanders believe him to be the \\"Chosen One\\" who will save their island from an ancient curse that has tormented them for generations. This curse originates from a powerful spirit who is angered by the Islanders' practice of using toads for their magical powers. As Jake becomes more involved in island life, he begins to develop a deep connection with the Islanders and their culture. Eventually, he realizes that he possesses mystical abilities, including controlling the elements and communicating with the toad spirits. Jake decides to use his newfound powers to confront the vengeful spirit and break the curse, hoping to save the island and its people. As the island's troubles intensify, Jake leads the Islanders in a fierce battle against the curse, using their combined magical powers to defeat the spirit and restore balance to the island. In a climactic moment, Jake sings an ancient song of healing while doing the toad ritual, which ultimately releases the vengeful spirit and frees the Islanders from the curse. Grateful for Jake's heroics, the Islanders share their rare, newfound knowledge of toad cures with the rest of the world. Jake returns to his hometown with not only his voice fully restored but also with newfound fame and respect in the music industry. He uses his second chance at a successful singing career to promote the power of love, unity, and the healing potential of the mysterious toad ritual. In the end, the once-desolate and fear-ridden island transforms into a thriving tourist destination, where people from all walks of life come for healing, and Jake becomes an ambassador of hope, championing the power of ancient wisdom and transformative journeys."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off. Paragraph: Two men in the Vietnam War needed to have their arms amputated. Unfortunately, the men were not able to be knocked unconscious for the operation. The doctor asked each patient if they wanted anesthetic injected into their arm or not. Marco replied that he wanted some, and Luke declined any anesthetic. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Whose nerve impulses will be transmitted? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, Luke's nerve impulses will be transmitted. As he declined the anesthetic, his nerve impulses will not be disrupted, and he will likely sense pain during the amputation procedure.
