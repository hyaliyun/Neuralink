However, the task itself is missing certain key elements such as context or a specific figure and table. In order to provide the most relevant and accurate translation, I would need more information on the content of the figure, what changes need to be made, and the table that should be inserted. Nonetheless, I can give you some general advice on how to amend a figure and insert a table in French. 1. First, identify the specific elements of the figure that need to be modified. Be sure to provide clear instructions on which parts should be changed and how they should be altered. In French, this can be communicated using phrases like \\"modifier l'élément X\\" (modify element X) or \\"remplacer Y par Z\\" (replace Y with Z). 2. Once the changes to the figure have been clearly stated, the next step is to insert a table. In French, the word \\"tableau\\" is used to describe a table, and \\"insérer\\" means to insert. To instruct someone to insert a table, you can use the phrase \\"insérez un tableau\\". 3. It's essential to provide details about the table's content, structure, and formatting. This can include information on the number of rows and columns, as well as any headings, labels, or specific data that should be included. To describe these aspects in French, you can use terms like \\"colonnes\\" (columns), \\"lignes\\" (rows), \\"en-tête\\" (header or heading), and \\"étiquettes\\" (labels). 4. Lastly, ensure the table is formatted and styled consistently with the rest of the document. This might involve specifying font types and sizes, colors, and alignment settings. Some useful French terms for discussing formatting include \\"police\\" (font), \\"taille\\" (size), \\"couleurs\\" (colors), and \\"alignement\\" (alignment). Here's an example of a more detailed task in French, assuming that we want to modify Figure 15 by changing the color of a specific element and inserting a table with four columns and three rows: \\"Dans la Figure 15, modifiez la couleur de l'élément A en bleu. Ensuite, insérez un tableau avec quatre colonnes et trois lignes. Les en-têtes des colonnes doivent être 'Colonne 1', 'Colonne 2', 'Colonne 3', et 'Colonne 4'. Les étiquettes des lignes doivent être 'Ligne 1', 'Ligne 2', et 'Ligne 3'. Utilisez la police Arial en taille 12 et alignez le texte à gauche.\\" By providing more context and information, we can offer a more detailed and accurate translation, and thus assist better in the given task."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reginald Martinez Jackson (born May 18, 1946) is an American former professional baseball right fielder who played 21 seasons for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, and California Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. Jackson was nicknamed \\"Mr. October\\" for his clutch hitting in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees. He helped Oakland win five consecutive American League West divisional pennants, three consecutive American League pennants and three consecutive World Series titles, from 1971 to 1975. Jackson became a free-agent again once the 1981 season was over. The owner of the California Angels, entertainer Gene Autry, had heard of Jackson's desire to return to California to play, and signed him to a five-year contract. On April 27, 1982, in Jackson's first game back at Yankee Stadium with the Angels, he broke out of a terrible season-starting slump to hit a home run off former teammate Ron Guidry. The at-bat began with Yankee fans, angry at Steinbrenner for letting Jackson get away, starting the \\"Reg-GIE!\\" chant, and ended it with the fans chanting \\"Steinbrenner sucks!\\" By the time of Jackson's election to the Hall of Fame, Steinbrenner had begun to say that letting him go was the biggest mistake he had made as Yankee owner. That season, the Angels won the American League West, and would do so again in 1986, but lost the American League Championship Series both times. On September 17, 1984, on the 17th anniversary of the day he hit his first home run, he hit his 500th, at Anaheim Stadium off Bud Black of the Royals. In 1987, he signed a one-year contract to return to the A's, wearing the number 44 with which he was now most associated rather than the number 9 he previously wore in Oakland. He announced he would retire after the season, at the age of 41. In his last at-bat, at Comiskey Park in Chicago on October 4, he collected a broken-bat single up the middle, but the A's lost to the White Sox, 5-2. Jackson was the last player in the major leagues to have played for the Kansas City Athletics.

LUCREZIA'S THIRD MARRIAGE At about the same time that Burchard was making in his Diarium those entries which reflect so grossly upon the Pope and Lucrezia, Gianluca Pozzi, the ambassador of Ferrara at the Vatican, was writing the following letter to his master, Duke Ercole, Lucrezia's father-in-law elect: \\"This evening, after supper, I accompanied Messer Gerardo Saraceni to visit the Most Illustrious Madonna Lucrezia in your Excellency's name and that of the Most Illustrious Don Alfonso. We entered into a long discussion touching various matters. In truth she showed herself a prudent, discreet, and good-natured lady.\\"(1) 1 See Gregorovius's Lucrezia Borgia. The handsome, athletic Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, with his brothers Sigismondo and Fernando, had arrived in Rome on December 23 with the imposing escort that was to accompany their brother Alfonso's bride back to Ferrara. Cesare was prominent in the welcome given them. Never, perhaps, had he made greater display than on the occasion of his riding out to meet the Ferrarese, accompanied by no fewer than 4,000 men-at-arms, and mounted on a great war-horse whose trappings of cloth of gold and jewels were estimated at 10,000 ducats. The days and nights that followed, until Lucrezia's departure a fortnight later, were days and nights of gaiety and merry-making at the Vatican; in banquets, dancing, the performance of comedies, masques, etc., was the time made to pass as agreeably as might be for the guests from Ferrara, and in all Cesare was conspicuous, either for the grace and zest with which he nightly danced, or for the skill and daring which he displayed in the daily joustings and entertainments, and more particularly in the bull-fight that was included in them. 1.

Answer the following question: Information: - Wigtown Burghs , also known as Wigton Burghs , . was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1800 and of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1885 . It was represented by one Member of Parliament ( MP ) . The first election in Wigtown Burghs was in 1708 . In 1707 -- 08 , members of the 1702 -- 1707 Parliament of Scotland were co-opted to serve in the 1st Parliament of Great Britain . See Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain , for further details . - In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries). - A burgh was an autonomous corporate entity in Scotland and Northern England, usually a town, or toun in Scots. This type of administrative division existed from the 12th century, when King David I created the first royal burghs. Burgh status was broadly analogous to borough status, found in the rest of the United Kingdom. Following local government reorganization in 1975 the title of \\"royal burgh\\" remains in use in many towns, but now has little more than ceremonial value. - Wigtownshire or the County of Wigtown is a registration county and lieutenancy area in south-west Scotland. Until 1975, Wigtownshire was one of the administrative counties used for local government purposes, and is now administered as part of the council area of Dumfries and Galloway. As a lieutenancy area, Wigtownshire has its own Lord Lieutenant, currently John Alexander Ross. - Newton Stewart (Gd: \\"Baile Ùr nan Stiùbhartach\\") is a former burgh town in Dumfries and Galloway, southwest Scotland. The town is on the River Cree with most of the town to the west of the river, and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Gateway to the Galloway Hills\\". Newton Stewart has also recently been twinned with the French town of Marcoussis. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament. - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801. - Stranraer is a town in Inch, Wigtownshire, in the west of Dumfries and Galloway, southwest Scotland. It lies on the shores of Loch Ryan, on the northern side of the isthmus joining the Rhins of Galloway to the mainland. Stranraer is Dumfries and Galloway's second-largest town, with a population including the surrounding area of nearly 13,000. - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - Dumfries (; possibly from ) is a market town and former royal burgh within the Dumfries and Galloway council area of Scotland. It is near the mouth of the River Nith into the Solway Firth. Dumfries was a civil parish and became the county town of the former county of Dumfriesshire. Dumfries is nicknamed \\"Queen of the South\\". People from Dumfries are known colloquially as \\"Doonhamers\\". - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London. - A Member of Parliament (MP) is the representative of the voters to a parliament. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title. - Dumfries and Galloway is one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland and is located in the western Southern Uplands. It comprises the historic counties of Dumfriesshire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and Wigtownshire, the latter two of which are collectively known as Galloway. The administrative centre is the town of Dumfries. - Wigtown is a town and former royal burgh in Wigtownshire, of which it is the county town, within the Dumfries and Galloway region in Scotland. It lies east of Stranraer and south of Newton Stewart. It is well known today as \\"Scotland's National Book Town\\" with a high concentration of second-hand book shops. It has a population of about 1,000. - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland. - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - A royal burgh was a type of Scottish burgh which had been founded by, or subsequently granted, a royal charter. Although abolished in law in 1975, the term is still used by many former royal burghs. - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state. - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament taxation, legislation and policy-making but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. What is the relationship between 'wigtown burghs ' and 'dumfries and galloway'? Answer:","completion":"Wigtown Burghs was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain (from 1708 to 1800) and the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (from 1801 to 1885).

Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to make cookie dough: Ingredients: - 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour - 1/2 teaspoon (2g) baking powder - 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt - 3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, softened - 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar - 1 large egg - 1 1/2 teaspoons (7 ml) vanilla extract - Optional: 1 to 2 cups (170 to 340g) chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins Instructions: 1. Gather all the ingredients and equipment: Before starting, make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment needed, such as a mixing bowl, an electric mixer or a wooden spoon, a whisk, measuring cups and spoons, and a rubber spatula. 2. Whisk dry ingredients: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. This will ensure even distribution of the baking powder and salt in the dough later. Set this bowl aside. 3. Cream butter and sugar: In a large mixing bowl, add the softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar. Using an electric mixer or a wooden spoon, cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This process typically takes about 3-5 minutes with an electric mixer at medium speed or 5-7 minutes when doing it by hand. Creaming the butter and sugar together is an essential step because it helps in incorporating air into the dough, resulting in a tender and light texture when baked. 4. Add the egg and vanilla extract: Once the butter and sugar mixture is creamy and fluffy, add the large egg and vanilla extract. Beat or mix the ingredients together until they are well combined. The egg provides structure and moisture, while the vanilla extract adds flavor to the dough. 5. Incorporate the dry ingredients: Gradually add the whisked dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) to the wet ingredients (butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract). Mix until just combined, ensuring that there are no pockets of dry flour remaining. Be careful not to overmix as this can cause the dough to become tough. 6. Add mix-ins (optional): If you wish to include chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins, now is the time to add them to the dough. Fold them in gently using a rubber spatula to distribute them evenly throughout the dough. 7. Chill the dough: Although this step is optional, it is recommended to chill the cookie dough for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. This step allows the dough to firm up, making it more manageable when handling, and helps prevent the cookies from spreading too much during baking. To chill, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the dough to an airtight container. 8. Preheat the oven and prepare the baking sheets: When you're ready to bake the cookies, preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Line your baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to prevent the cookies from sticking. 9. Scoop and shape the dough: Using a cookie scoop or two spoons, scoop out the desired amount of dough and shape it into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, ensuring they are spaced about 2 inches (5 cm) apart to allow room for spreading while baking. 10. Bake the cookies: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The baking time may vary depending on the size of your cookies. 11.

International influences help to encourage legal actions to be taken in India, such as the Geneva Declaration of the Right of Children Act was passed in 1924. This act was followed by The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 to which incorporated the basic human rights and needs of children for proper progression and growth in their younger years. These international acts encouraged major changes to the workforce in India which occurred in 1986 when the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was put into place. This act prohibited hiring children younger than the age of 14, and from working in hazardous conditions. What did the international acts do? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The international acts played a vital role in shaping and influencing the legal actions taken in India to protect children's rights and ensure their well-being. The Geneva Declaration of the Right of Children Act, passed in 1924, and The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, enacted in 1948, outlined the fundamental human rights and needs of children. These declarations emphasized the importance of proper progression and growth during a child's formative years. By incorporating the principles set forth in these international acts, India was encouraged to reevaluate its policies and labor laws, especially those affecting children. As a result, major changes occurred within the Indian workforce. In 1986, the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was established, which prohibited the hiring of children younger than 14 and banned their employment in hazardous conditions. In summary, the international acts contributed to raising awareness and setting standards regarding children's rights and their proper treatment in the global community. These acts served as a catalyst for India to implement legal measures that better protected its young citizens from exploitation and provided them with opportunities for a healthy and safe upbringing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. A gregarious male gorilla is to be sent for therapy after he bit one female gorilla and sneered at others. Patrick, a 430lb Western lowland gorilla, will be moved from Dallas Zoo to the Riverbanks Zoo and Gardens in Columbia, South Carolina, where he will live the bachelor life in his own digs. His new home is known for working with gorillas with behaviour problems. Not a ladies' man: Patrick, a 430-pound Western lowland gorilla, will be moved to the Riverbanks Zoo and Gardens in Columbia, South Carolina, after he bit one female and sneered and nipped at others. Dallas Zoo officials said Patrick gets along fine with humans but not with other gorillas. They said they have tried repeatedly to socialise him with the other gorillas, particularly the females, in the hopes that he might get along and even breed. Instead, he bit one female and sneered and nipped at others. 'It's not like we haven't tried, he's been here for 18 years' said Laurie Holloway, a spokesman for the zoo. Patrick was more tolerant of other male gorillas but seemed only to engage with Jabari, who was shot dead by Dallas police after he escaped in 2004 and injured three people. Only friend: Patrick (background) with his friend Jabari, who was shot dead by Dallas police after escaping and injuring three people in 2004. Because of his cranky behaviour, Patrick has been kept in his own habitat separate from the other gorillas. But Dallas Zoo needs to reclaim Patrick's space because it recently acquired two new males from the Calgary Zoo, including Zola, a break-dancing gorilla who stars in a video that has gone viral on the Internet. John Davis, curator of mammals at the Riverbanks Zoo, said that initially Patrick will be separated from the zoo's three other gorillas, all males, but will be able to see and smell them. Eventually Patrick will be introduced to the guys and zoo officials aren't ruling out the possibility that they can live together in a spacious, wooded bachelor pad, Davis said. Born at the Bronx Zoo in 1990, Patrick was abandoned by his mother and then transferred to the Toronto Zoo, where he was hand-raised along with another male about the same age. At age five, he was transferred to Dallas, zoo officials said. Because of his rearing, Patrick gets along well with people and is a popular favorite among visitors and zookeepers at the Dallas Zoo, Holloway said. 'He's beautiful and smart and everyone loves him,' said Ms Holloway. 'We're really sad to see him go but it's for the best for the zoo and for Patrick.' The zoo will have a few days of 'We'll miss ya, Patrick!' celebrations for the ousted primate. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Ascension Island was made a dependency of Saint Helena in 1922, and Tristan da Cunha followed in 1938. During the Second World War, the United States built Wideawake airport on Ascension in 1942, but no military use was made of Saint Helena.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In the 8th year of the 1900s, or 1908, various events and developments occurred around the world. However, let's consider the context provided which is related to industries and territories, such as the manufacturing of fibre from New Zealand flax in 1907, the establishment of Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha as dependencies of Saint Helena, and the construction of Wideawake airport during World War II. Within this context, the events of 1908 are not as directly impactful on these developments, but they did contribute to the broader global environment and might have influenced these territories indirectly. 1. Industrial advancements and the economy: There was significant progress in the realm of industrialization and technologies, which facilitated the growth of various industries and the economy. The Model T Ford was introduced, revolutionizing personal transportation and the automotive industry. Other innovations, such as the first long-distance radio transmission, also enhanced global communication capabilities and had implications for businesses and trade on an international scale. 2. Territories and global politics: 1908 saw some shifts in territorial claims and political alliances around the world. For instance, Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, leading to tensions amongst major powers that contributed to the conditions ultimately leading to World War I. The Triple Entente was formalized in 1908, consisting of an agreement between Great Britain, France, and Russia to promote mutual defense and cooperation. This alliance would also have an impact on the eventual outbreak of war in 1914. 3. Exploration and scientific discoveries: In 1908, the Nimrod Expedition to the Antarctic, led by explorer Ernest Shackleton, made significant progress towards the South Pole, ultimately coming within 100 miles of their target before being forced to turn back due to dwindling supplies. These findings motivated further expedition efforts from other parties, including Robert Falcon Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition in 1910. Additionally, there were important scientific developments in this year, such as the introduction of Cellophane by Swiss chemist Jacques E. Brandenberger. This new transparent packaging material would impact various industries in the years to come, including food packaging and consumer goods protection. Given this context, while there isn't a direct link to the developments mentioned in the provided excerpt, the events and advancements in the 8th year of the 1900s had broader implications for worldwide industrial growth, territorial disputes, and evolving technologies. These global shifts in power dynamics and industrialization might have contributed in some ways to the subsequent developments that occurred regarding Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha, and their related industries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film was directed by David Silverman, and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell and Russi Taylor, with Tom Hanks, Green Day and Albert Brooks in guest roles. The film follows Homer Simpson, whose irresponsibility gets the best of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up following receipt of a warning from the Environmental Protection Agency. As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, when he intends to destroy Springfield. Context: The convenience store chain 7-Eleven transformed 11 of its stores in the U.S. and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts, at the cost of approximately 10 million. 7-Eleven also sold Simpsons-themed merchandise in many of its stores. This included \\"Squishees\\", \\"Buzz Cola\\", \\"Krusty-O's\\" Cereal, and \\"Pink Movie Donuts\\". This promotion resulted in a 30% increase in profits for the altered 7-Eleven stores. Homer performed a special animated opening monologue for the edition of July 24, 2007 of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, as part of another promotion. Promotions also occurred around the world. 20th Century Fox erected a \\"giant pink donut\\" in the town of Springfield in Canterbury, New Zealand to celebrate being named Springfield, while in London a double decker-sized floating inflatable Spider Pig was set up by the Battersea Power Station. In Dorset, England, an image of Homer was painted next to the hill figure, the Cerne Abbas Giant. This caused outrage amongst local neopagans who performed \\"rain magic\\" to try to get it washed away. McFarlane Toys released a line of action figures based on the film, EA Games released The Simpsons Game, to coincide with the film's DVD release, although the plot of the game was not based on the film. Samsung released The Simpsons Movie phone, and Microsoft produced a limited edition The Simpsons Movie Xbox 360. Ben & Jerry's created a Simpsons-themed beer and donut-flavored ice cream, entitled \\"Duff & D'oh! Nuts\\". Windows Live Messenger presented their users with the opportunity to download a free animated and static content for use within their conversations. Burger King produced a line of Simpsons toy figures that were given away with children's meals, and ran a series of Simpsons-themed television adverts to promote this. JetBlue Airways held a series of online sweepstakes to win a trip to the film's Los Angeles, California premiere. They also included a channel dedicated to The Simpsons on their planes' in-flight entertainment system. Question: Did they do any Internet marketing. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, internet marketing played a significant role in promoting The Simpsons Movie. The various promotional strategies and tie-ins with well-known brands expanded the film's exposure to the public, including online campaigns. Multiple brands leveraged their digital presence to create buzz and cross-promote the movie. Here are some notable examples: 1. Windows Live Messenger: As part of the promotion, Windows Live Messenger offered users the opportunity to download free animated and static content based on The Simpsons Movie for use within their conversations. This integration increased brand visibility and encouraged users to share the content with others, creating organic user-generated marketing. 2. JetBlue Airways: In addition to their flight-related promotions, JetBlue Airways conducted a series of online sweepstakes, allowing participants to enter for a chance to win a trip to the movie's premiere in Los Angeles, California. Through these digital contests, JetBlue helped create buzz for the movie, enhanced user engagement, and fostered a connection between air travel and the film. 3. Burger King: Burger King released a line of Simpsons toy figures which were included with children's meals, and they promoted these toys through a series of Simpsons-themed television advertisements. However, these efforts were also supported by online presence, such as their website and social media channels, to maximize the reach of their promotions. 4. The Simpsons Game: Although the game's plot was not directly based on the film, EA Games released The Simpsons Game as a tie-in to coincide with the movie's DVD release. Online marketing strategies were employed to promote the game, including trailers, ads on gaming websites, and social media posts, which indirectly bolstered the movie's visibility. 5. Social Media and Viral Marketing: Given the vast global fanbase of The Simpsons, internet users actively shared promotional content related to The Simpsons Movie on social media platforms, discussion forums, and fan sites, contributing to the movie's outreach and generating a sense of anticipation among fans. In conclusion, internet marketing played an essential role in promoting The Simpsons Movie, alongside the various merchandising tie-ins and real-world promotions executed by well-known brands. Leveraging digital channels extended the film's reach, boosted engagement, and increased public awareness of the movie and its related promotional products."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: Schwartz went to law school to do corporate work. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences convey different reasons for Schwartz going to law school. In the first sentence, Schwartz states that they went to law school to do social justice work. This implies that their primary motivation for attending law school was to pursue a career related to addressing social inequalities and injustices. On the other hand, the second sentence claims that Schwartz went to law school to do corporate work. This statement implies a different motivation, suggesting that Schwartz's purpose was to pursue a career in corporate law, which typically deals with the legal aspects of business and commercial transactions. It is worth noting that the two sentences do not necessarily contradict each other, as it's possible for someone to have multiple motivations for attending law school. However, without further context or clarification, we cannot determine whether Schwartz had multiple reasons for going to law school or if there is a discrepancy between the two statements.

I read this background article the other day: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. I am facing a new situation today: Mark was attending the music festival in his city. First, he went to stage one, where the music was playing in high decibel. Then he went to stage two. There the music was playing in low decibel. He kind of liked the latter one. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which stage would be louder, stage one or stage two? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, we can follow these steps to answer the question correctly: Step 1: Understand the scenario In the new situation, Mark went to a music festival with two stages. Stage one had music playing at high decibel levels, while stage two had music playing at low decibel levels. Mark liked the latter one (stage two). Step 2: Use the knowledge from the background article From the background article, we know that higher decibel levels correspond to louder sounds and that every 10-decibel increase results in a loudness 10 times greater than the previous level. Step 3: Compare the stages The question asks us to determine which stage is louder. Since stage one had music playing at higher decibel levels, we can conclude that stage one would be louder than stage two. So the correct answer is: Stage one would be louder than stage two."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Why does Jon Snow know nothing? \\"Content That Contains Spoilers: Is it mere co-incidence that Melisandre and Ygritte both say the exact same words 'You know nothing' to Jon Snow?\\" Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"While the two questions may appear to be similar, they are not necessarily paraphrases of each other. The first question asks \\"Why does Jon Snow know nothing?\\" and seeks a general understanding of the phrase, its origin, and its significance within the context of the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe. The second question, \\"Is it a mere coincidence that Melisandre and Ygritte both say the exact same words 'You know nothing' to Jon Snow?\\" is more specific as it asks whether the use of the phrase by two different characters is a coincidence or has a deeper meaning. To address the first question, the phrase \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\" is primarily associated with Ygritte, a Wildling woman Jon Snow falls in love with in George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" novels and the subsequent \\"Game of Thrones\\" television adaptation. This phrase became popular due to its frequent use by Ygritte during her interactions with Jon Snow, and it serves to convey Jon's naivety and lack of experience in the wider world and its complexities. Moreover, these words often highlight the differences between the politically charged upbringing Jon experiences at Winterfell and the rough-and-tumble lifestyle Ygritte and other Wildlings have had to endure. However, Jon's naivety and perceived ignorance are illustrated through his hero's journey as he endeavors to learn, grow, and adapt to the circumstances that befall him. As Jon faces a variety of challenges and battles, both literal and metaphorical, he gains insight and wisdom, proving himself as a leader and a skilled tactician. By the series' end, Jon has grown tremendously, distinguishing himself as a mature and knowledgeable individual. Now, addressing the second question, Melisandre, the Red Priestess, also uses the same phrase when speaking with Jon Snow. This occurrence prompts curiosity regarding whether it is a mere repetition or if there is a deeper connection between the two instances. The phrase, as mentioned earlier, exemplifies Jon's inexperience and lack of understanding of matters beyond his own scope. Melisandre's use of the same phrase could signify a few things. First, it may be to remind Jon that he still has much to learn about the world, its people, and the unexplained forces that govern it, especially as Melisandre is known for her connection with the supernatural and her worship of R'hllor, the Lord of Light. Secondly, it could be a way for the author or the showrunners to draw a parallel between the two influential women in Jon's life – Ygritte and Melisandre. These women show Jon different aspects of life and, ultimately, shape his journey in various ways. In conclusion, while the two questions initially present similarities, they diverge in their goals. The first question aims for a broader understanding of the iconic phrase, while the second question seeks a deeper analysis of its significance when spoken by Melisandre and Ygritte.

The Yum Brands subsidiary is spitting out 185 million to reboot its business, which includes sprucing up some of its 4,300 stores, pushing new Deep South fare, and bringing back in TV ads what a press release calls the \\"brand's greatest asset\\": the ever-popular Colonel Sanders, who died in 1980 and hasn't been seen in a KFC ad in two decades. \\"The Colonel was the consummate American showman,\\" KFC's marketing head tells the Post. \\"He was the person with bling before bling was even a word.\\" For now, KFC is bringing him back to life through SNL alum Darrell Hammond, who issued a \\"State of Kentucky Fried Chicken Address\\" as the colonel in a promo KFC tweeted out May 19. There's also what Adweek calls an \\"oddly educational\\" Hall of Colonels website and even a Colonel Quest video game. Response on social media has been … mixed.

But will KFC be bowing to the healthy-eating trend that forced McDonald's to start testing kale in its offerings? Doesn't look that way, the Post notes, though the chain will be using chicken \\"traceability\\" boards in restaurants to say where local chicken came from. Expand this summary.","completion":"KFC has recently decided to revive Colonel Sanders, its founder who died in 1980, as part of a 185 million effort to reboot its business and compete with rival fast-food chains like Chick-fil-A. The Yum Brands subsidiary is spending the money on refurbishing some of its 4,300 stores, promoting new Deep South fare, and creating TV ads featuring the popular Colonel Sanders. The late founder of the business will be portrayed by Saturday Night Live star Darrell Hammond, who hosted a \\"State of Kentucky Fried Chicken Address\\" as the Colonel on May 19th. The resurrection of Colonel Sanders will also include an \\"oddly educational\\" Hall of Colonels website and a Colonel Quest video game. In addition to reviving Colonel Sanders to boost brand awareness, KFC has been adopting various strategies to turn their business around. Contrary to the healthy-eating trends pursued by some of its fast-food rivals, such as McDonald's testing the use of kale in its products, KFC is focusing on its core product offering: fried chicken. They believe that there are \\"few problems a bucket of fried chicken can't solve\\" and that their customers are looking for \\"something indulgent and something they can share with their family and friends.\\" It remains to be seen if these strategies, along with the better marketing of its products, will enable KFC to regain its market share from Chick-fil-A and other competitors. KFC is also introducing \\"chicken traceability\\" boards in its restaurants in an effort to become more transparent about where the chain sources its chickens. This move could prove fruitful as consumers become increasingly concerned about the origins of the food they consume. Overall, KFC's combination of nostalgia and transparency has the potential to improve the customer experience, enticing both old and new customers to give the chain a try (or a second chance)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM.

Write a title for this article: Ten years after I am dead and gone, I suspect only two people will give much thought to me, and their names are Henry and Hannah. They're my legacy, so I hope they thrive -- and I sure hope they remember me fondly. Henry and Hannah are, of course, my children, now ages 15 and 19, respectively. Like any parent, I spend a lot of time thinking about my kids, including how I can best help them financially. This isn't simply about coughing up dollars and cents, though the sums involved have been frighteningly large. Rather, what it's really about is passing along values. Yes, I want my kids to be financially successful. But mostly, I want them to be competent, contented managers of their own money, so they don't spend their lives agonizing over their finances and dogged by foolish mistakes. I am not claiming to have the road map for every parent. We all have different values, different incomes and strong ideas about how best to raise children -- and you will likely scoff at some of the things I've done. With that caveat, here are a dozen ways I have endeavored to help my kids financially. If children are to grow up to be successful savers and investors, they need to learn two key skills: How to delay gratification and how to take risks prudently. The first is easily the most important. Indeed, the self-control needed to delay gratification is associated not only with good saving habits, but also with things like succeeding in school and coping better with frustration and stress. Yet this isn't an easy skill to teach. Henry and Hannah grew up spending their parents' cash, so they didn't have much incentive to curb their desires. My response? Make them feel like they're spending their own money. One of my early tricks was the soda game, which I learned about from a reader. When my children were young and we went to restaurants, I would give them a choice: They could have a soda or they could have 1. Henry and Hannah ended up drinking a lot of water. Emboldened by the soda game's success, I looked for other ways to apply the same notion. The breakthrough came when Hannah was 14 and Henry was 10. That was when I opened a savings account for each of them. The accounts came with a cash-machine card. Every three months since then, I have deposited pocket money for them in their savings accounts and, as they have grown older, their clothing allowance as well. That way, they've had to learn to budget for a three-month period. More important, they no longer ask me for money. Instead, if they want to buy something, they have to ask themselves. The effect has been startling. Henry and Hannah almost immediately became more careful spenders. Sound manipulative? You'd better believe it. But I also think of it as financial self-defense. Suppose Henry and Hannah don't learn good money skills and grow up to be financial deadbeats. If they ended up deeply in debt, I can't imagine not helping -- at which point their financial problems would be mine. I haven't just molded Henry and Hannah with financial incentives. I have also used family stories. Values are passed down to our children in the stories we tell. My children may live in an affluent household in an affluent town. But I want them to know that their mother and I struggled financially, and that they will likely have their own struggles. So I talk about the mouse- and cockroach-infested Brooklyn apartment where we all lived while their mother worked on her Ph.D. and we squeaked by on a junior reporter's salary. I tell them about the beaten-up '76 Camaro that used to stall if the traffic light stayed red too long. I recount taking them as toddlers to the \\"toy museum,\\" otherwise known as FAO Schwarz, where we would play with the dolls and the trains but never buy. Instead of regaling my children with these tales, I could simply lecture them about the virtues of thrift. But the stories pack far more punch. I have also encouraged my kids to be suspicious of displays of opulence, whether it's the big house, the fancy car or the designer clothes. The fact is, this sort of spending doesn't lead to lasting happiness, but it can create a heap of financial stress. In belittling conspicuous consumption, I may be a little too strident, but there's a reason. Henry and Hannah may have grown up hearing about the dilapidated Brooklyn apartment. But I grew up hearing a far more powerful story, about my maternal grandfather and his four siblings, who in the 1940s each inherited what today would be millions of dollars. My grandfather's siblings quickly blew the money on fast cars and high living. My grandfather blew his money more slowly, on horses and cattle farming. Either way, the great family fortune was gone, and reckless spending was largely to blame. When my children were young, I opened a variable annuity for each of them. This isn't a product I particularly like, because many have outrageously high annual expenses and charge back-end sales commissions if you sell within, say, the first seven years. Still, there are a few no-load variable annuities with low annual expenses, notably the offerings from Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group. Moreover, unlike with an individual retirement account, you don't need earned income to fund a variable annuity, so you can open an account for a toddler. Today, my kids' low-cost variable annuities are each worth some 37,000. I have long been captivated by the idea of starting Henry and Hannah on the road to retirement. Think about it: The dollars I invested when they were youngsters might enjoy six decades of tax-deferred compounding. That's enough to turn 1 into over 100, assuming an 8% annual return. And thanks to the tax penalty on early withdrawals, my children will be discouraged from touching the money before they are 59&frac12;. There are far better investment vehicles than a variable annuity, and my chance came a few years ago. Hannah got a job at a local restaurant, which meant she had earned income. That allowed me to open a Roth individual retirement account for her, which will give Hannah tax-free growth. Instead, I could have funded a regular IRA, where withdrawals are taxable but you get an initial tax deduction. That tax deduction, however, wouldn't have been worth much, given Hannah's low tax rate, so the Roth seemed like a better bet. The money I've stashed in my kids' variable annuities and in Hannah's Roth IRA won't be nearly enough to pay for their retirement, especially once you figure in inflation. But fully funding their retirement was never my aim. Rather, the accounts are intended to be a powerful example, showing my children how money will grow if they are willing to sit quietly with a diverse collection of low-cost funds. When I bought my first home, my parents helped me financially, and I want to do the same for my kids. To that end, I have invested 15,000 for each of them. Even with a decade or more of growth, that 15,000 probably won't be nearly enough for a 20% down payment. But it will give them something to build on. I stashed Hannah's 15,000 in a target-date mutual fund that's geared toward 2010, while Henry's money is in a 2015 fund. I bought those funds knowing my kids probably won't buy homes until five or 10 years after those dates. My thinking: Target-date funds typically have around half their money in stocks as of their target date, and then they continue to become more conservative in the years that follow. By the time my kids need their down-payment money, their target-date funds should be largely invested in bonds. When my kids buy a house, they won't just need a down payment. They will also want to have a good credit score. With that in mind, I listed Hannah as a joint account holder on my Visa card earlier this year. That meant the card's credit history was added to her previously blank credit report. Suddenly, she looked like a model financial citizen. That allowed her, a few months later, to apply for a Discover card on her own. I now have her on a strict regimen, where she charges a small sum each month and dutifully pays it off, thus slowly building up a good credit score. When Henry reaches college age, I will go through the same nonsense with him. This, alas, is necessary nonsense. The reality is, a good credit score will help my kids get a lower mortgage rate, lower insurance premiums and a host of other financial benefits. Full disclosure: I am divorced. But even before my marriage broke up, I was horrified by the way many families blow 20,000 or 30,000 on a single day of celebration for a wedding. To put such spending in context, consider this: According to the Federal Reserve's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, more than 96% of households headed by someone 65 to 74 had some savings -- but the median value of these financial assets, including things like checking accounts, stocks and mutual funds, was just 36,100. Spending 30,000 on a party is not one of my values, and I've made sure my kids know it. I have told them I will give them 5,000 toward a wedding or at age 30, whichever comes first. What if they want the 30,000 wedding? They can ask their mother. While an expensive wedding is low on my list of priorities, a good education ranks near the top. My ex-wife and I long ago agreed that we would pay the full cost of our children's undergraduate education. Again, this was something my parents did for me, and we all tend to be heavily influenced by our parents' behavior. There is, however, a limit to my generosity. I have told Henry and Hannah that, if they want to go on to graduate school, they will have to take out loans. I may relent somewhat when the time comes. But I think that there should be some cost to staying in school, so I am not inclined to continue footing the full tab. As you might gather, I have talked to my kids a fair amount about money. They know they will graduate college debt-free, they will get some help toward a house down payment and they will receive just 5,000 toward a wedding. They know about the retirement accounts. I have also promised them 5,000 upon graduating college, to get them started in the world. No doubt some folks will think I'm overly generous, while others might consider me cheap. Many will question my priorities. For instance, folks have told me that they would have skipped the retirement accounts and allocated more toward a house down payment. But, frankly, the precise sums aren't that important. Instead, what I am striving to do is set expectations. By detailing everything to Henry and Hannah, I have made it clear where I think my financial responsibility ends and where theirs will begin. Along the way, I have also endeavored to teach my kids about sensible investing. It's been a slow process. For instance, earlier this decade, I tried a family investment contest. We all picked a mutual fund, I invested 50 a month in each and then we tracked who fared best. I thought the competition would grab their interest, but it wasn't a great success. Maybe Henry and Hannah were too young. Indeed, I have continued to show them their mutual-fund statements as they arrive in the mail, and my kids have grown more interested as they have grown older. They have also become more curious about the financial markets, and I can now chat about investing for at least 30 seconds before they reach for their iPods. I hope enough of this will stick, and they will grow up to be prudent managers of their own money. The potential savings are huge. A financial adviser might charge 1% of a portfolio's value each year, and then recommend mutual funds that cost another 1%. What if my children learn to build their own index-fund portfolios that cost a mere 0.2% a year? When their portfolios hit 1 million, they will pay just 2,000 a year in investment costs, instead of the 20,000 they would be paying if they used an adviser. And, with any luck, they will remember whom to thank. —Mr. Clements, who is based in New York, writes the Getting Going column for The Wall Street Journal.

We have the equation: -72*l + 19*l = 7*l + 300 Step 1: Let's look at the left side of the equation where we have: -72*l + 19*l Now, imagine you have -72 apples and you get 19 more apples. How many apples do you have now? You get: -72 + 19 = -53 Now, you have -53 apples, so on the left side of the equation, it would be: -53*l Step 2: Now our equation looks like this: -53*l = 7*l + 300 Now, let's move the 7*l to the left side of the equation. To do that, we need to take away 7*l from both sides. It's like having 7 apples and taking them away. We now have: -53*l - 7*l = 300 Step 3: Next, we have: -53*l - 7*l Imagine you have -53 apples, and you take away 7 more apples. How many apples do you have? You get: -53 - 7 = -60 Now, you have -60 apples, so it would be: -60*l = 300 Step 4: Now we have: -60*l = 300 We need to find out what l is. Let's pretend we have -60 cookies and they equal 300. We want to know how many times we have to multiply -60 to get 300. To find out how many times, we need to divide 300 by -60. Let's do the math: 300 / -60 = -5 So, l = -5.

Please write a short summary for the following article: China's 'Ghost Cities' Have Nothing On The 'Ghost Country' That Is The U.S. Ordos, China’s biggest Ghost city. (Photo credit: iamuday) China’s rise as an economic powerhouse is one of the happiest stories of modern times. Though its citizens once struggled in horrific ways under the brutal thumb of a totalitarian government, now its people are increasingly enjoying the fruits of capitalism. And while its naive detractors would say otherwise, capitalism loves poor people more than anyone as China’s leap from extreme poverty reveals. It’s also important to point out that China’s embrace of capitalism has been profoundly good for all Americans. Particularly amid our own difficult economic times, every day that the Chinese get up to go to work means Americans get a raise for Chinese workers producing all manner of products that cost us less and less as manufacture in China is perfected. That the Chinese have joined an increasingly integrated global economy also means that Americans have been able to migrate to higher paying jobs of the service variety thanks to the ability of Chinese workers to shoulder the manufacturing load of low value goods. Absent our sharing of labor with Chinese workers, Americans would have to do a lot of work that wouldn’t pay very well. To put it more simply, manufacture in China of shoes, socks and t-shirts means that Americans have the time to create Google Google, Microsoft Microsoft and Intel Intel. A better trading arrangement would be hard to fathom. Of course, China’s economic renaissance has predictably generated quite a lot of pessimism about its prospects within the commentariat. Editorial about a coming China ‘bubble’ is arguably as common as is commentary extolling the virtues of its real economic growth. On the ‘bubble’ front, what’s not infrequently mentioned is the existence of ‘ghost cities’ throughout the restless country. Those cities are apparently full of empty residential buildings, and it’s said that buildings without buyers are made possible by government driven loans. The thinking there is that with China’s government desperate to maintain high GDP growth, it’s essentially funding the building of anything so that GDP measures continue to soar. About all this Keynesian construction of buildings for the sake of it, China skeptics have a point; albeit one many of those same skeptics don’t quite grasp. Governments have no resources, so for them to direct limited capital toward activity of no discernible economic value is for governments to lay a wet blanket on actual growth. If the above is doubted, readers need only ask themselves who is better at allocating capital in the United States: Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Paul Tudor Jones, or Mitch McConnell, Harry Reid, John Boehner, and Nancy Pelosi. The nature of the question makes for an easy answer, at which point it should be stressed to extent that some Chinese cities are entirely the creation of its GDP-focused government, their existence serves as physical evidence that China’s economy is performing at sub-optimal levels. Politicians are many things, but they’re not skilled investors. By definition. The problem with this ankle-biting about China is that it largely ignores the ‘Ghost Country’ that is the United States. This assertion is in no way meant to dismiss the very real economic activity taking place all over the U.S. Lest we forget, governments have no resources other than that which they tax and borrow from us. For our government to spend with abandon, it must be true that Americans are enormously productive such that our wasteful federal minders can tax and borrow away our wealth to begin with. Still, we’re once again a ghost country, and some of our phantoms don’t even live within the 50 states. To see how this is true, consider the military. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard “Buck” McKeon has warned that cuts in defense spending “would cripple our economy” owing to the sad reality that so many owe their paycheck and their business to defense outlays. If we ignore first how very Keynesian many Republicans have become on the subject of defense spending, at present our military protects some of the richest countries in the world in Europe and Asia. For those who saw the documentary, Restrepo, they’re aware that a major part of our military strategy in Afghanistan involves bribing the warlords with jobs programs. Is a great deal of defense spending the wasteful equivalent of ‘Ghost Cities’? It says here that it is. Laws and regulations don’t work at all as evidenced by the collapse of the heavily regulated banking sector in 2008, but all the rules that are legislated and written by politicians and bureaucrats have created massive special interest groups of the accountant, consultant and lawyer variety whose paychecks are almost totally a function of incomprehensible tax and regulatory codes. Without our tax system and a Federal Register that grows by leaps and bounds year after year, each of these facilitator professions would vanish for the most part. Another proverbial ‘Ghost City’ created by our federal government. What about corporate welfare? From subsidies for rich farmers, loans to well-connected businesses like Solyndra, to myriad tax breaks for all sorts of commercial activity approved by Congress, the cost of handouts to corporations is said to run upwards of 160 billion per year. And with Washington, D.C. the center of all this government largesse, cranes are everywhere as developers erect office and residential buildings meant to house and office all those rushing into our capitol city to get a piece of the wealth siphoned off from the actual wealth producers who don’t live in Washington, D.C.; D.C. the Mother of all Ghost Cities. All of which brings us to federal spending itself. This is important when we consider the Keynesian, and as such, very worthless calculation of economic growth that is GDP. The latter counts government spending as an additive aspect of economic growth even though our government can only spend what it takes from the rest of us first. U.S. GDP is measured at around 15 trillion, and government spending accounts for more than a fifth of that 15 trillion. No doubt some of that spending serves an actual and useful constitutional purpose, but a vastly greater amount of it constitutes spending and favor-giving that has no economic raison d’etre other than propping up the proverbial ‘Ghost Cities’ in the U.S., and well outside our borders. It’s arguably true that China’s government has used funds taken from its citizens to build that which has no purpose, but when it comes to creating the most garish of ‘Ghost Cities,’ our own United States has no equal. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the comparison between China's 'Ghost Cities' and the 'Ghost Country' status of the United States. While China's economic growth has been labelled a 'bubble' with many empty residential buildings funded by government-driven loans, the US has its share of issues as well, with military spending, corporate welfare, and federal spending propping up economically unviable projects and sectors.

There's no evaluation of the app's performance, user interface, functionality, or overall satisfaction from the user.

However, let's analyze different recommendation scenarios by breaking them down: 1. Not at all: If the review \\"Mwinjuma Athumam\\" was a negative comment or complaint about the app, it could be an indication to not recommend the app to a friend. But, since the context of the statement is not clear, we cannot assume it is a negative review and base our recommendation on that assumption. 2. No: If the app's functions were deemed subpar or not fulfilling the user's needs, the recommendation might be \\"No.\\" However, as we don't have enough information from the review, it is not possible to determine the app's functionality and performance. 3. Maybe: A \\"Maybe\\" recommendation might be given to an app with mixed reviews, or one that fulfills certain niche needs. Since we lack detailed information about the app's performance and its overall impact on the user, a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation could potentially be given, considering the uncertainty. 4. Yes: A \\"Yes\\" recommendation implies that the app is good, provides valuable features, and addresses the user's needs. Since the review doesn't provide any information on whether the app fulfills these criteria, it's hard to definitively say \\"Yes.\\" 5. Definitely: A \\"Definitely\\" recommendation means the app has met or exceeded the user's expectations and provides an excellent user experience. Again, the review doesn't provide enough information to justify a strong recommendation. In conclusion, based solely on the review \\"Mwinjuma Athumam,\\" a definitive recommendation cannot be made. To provide a better recommendation, more in-depth reviews and detailed analysis of the app's features and performance would be necessary.

We have: -10*t = -23*t + 30*t - 119 First, let's look at the \\"t\\" parts. We have -23*t and 30*t together. If you have -23 cookies and I give you 30 cookies, how many cookies do you have now? That's right, you have 7 cookies! So, let's replace the -23*t + 30*t with 7*t: -10*t = 7*t - 119 Now, let's take the 7*t and move it from the right side to the left side. To do that, we must change its sign. So if we have 7*t, we'll change it to -7*t: -10*t - 7*t = -119 Now, let's combine the two \\"t\\" parts on the left side. If you have -10 apples and I take away 7 more apples, how many apples do you have? That's correct, you have -17 apples! So, let's write that down: -17*t = -119 We're almost done! Now, we want to find out what \\"t\\" is. To do that, we need to divide the equation by -17: t = -119 / -17 Can you guess what happens when you divide a negative number by another negative number?

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Jewish people often faced?\\" Context: \\"During the Middle Ages, Paris was a center of Jewish learning with famous Talmudic scholars, such as Yechiel of Paris who took part in the Disputation of Paris between Christian and Jewish intellectuals. The Parisian Jewish community was victim of persecution, alternating expulsions and returns, until France became the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution. Although 75% of the Jewish population in France survived the Holocaust during World War II, half the city's Jewish population perished in Nazi concentration camps, while some others fled abroad. A large migration of North Africa Sephardic Jews settled Paris in the 1960s, and represent most of the Paris Jewish community today. There are currently 83 synagogues in the city; The Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, built in 1913 by architect Hector Guimard, is a Paris landmark.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"During the Middle Ages, Jewish people in Paris often faced a multitude of challenges and hardships, including persecution, expulsions, and difficult returns to the city. The fluctuating political and social atmosphere significantly impacted the Parisian Jewish community, leading to ongoing adversity. Persecution: The Parisian Jewish community was subjected to discrimination and prejudice during the Middle Ages. This persecution took various forms such as social exclusion, hostility, and animosity from the Christian majority. Anti-Semitic attitudes, prevalent at the time, were fueled by the belief that Jews were Christ-killers and the scapegoating of Jews for widespread economic and social problems. Expulsions and Returns: Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews in Paris faced numerous instances of expulsions only to be readmitted and expelled again. Notable examples include the 1249 expulsion by King Louis IX, the 1306 expulsion under Philip IV, and the 1394 expulsion ordered by Charles VI. In between these expulsions, French monarchs temporarily allowed the return of Jews for various reasons, including their valuable skills in trade, finance, and medicine. Impact of the French Revolution: The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, proclaimed during the French Revolution, granted full civil rights to the Jewish population in France, making it the first European country to do so. Despite the newfound legal equality, underlying anti-Semitic attitudes persisted, and many Jews continued to face discrimination within society. World War II and the Holocaust: The persecution of Jewish people took a devastating turn during World War II under Nazi occupation. Half of Paris's Jewish population perished in concentration camps, while others managed to escape to safer territories. After the war, France's Jewish community sought to rebuild and remember those who had been lost during the Holocaust. North African Sephardic Immigration: In the 1960s, Paris saw a new wave of Jewish migration as a result of political instability in North Africa. Many Sephardic Jews from countries such as Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia settled in Paris, adding a rich diversity to the city's Jewish community, which now constitutes the majority of the Parisian Jewish population. Present-day Jewish community: Today, the Jewish community in Paris is diverse and thriving, with 83 synagogues and cultural institutions scattered throughout the city. Landmarks such as the Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, designed by Hector Guimard, stand as symbols of the resilience and perseverance of the Parisian Jewish community despite the difficult history they have faced over the centuries. In conclusion, Jewish people in Paris have faced significant challenges throughout history, including persecution, expulsions, and the devastating impact of the Holocaust. However, the community has also shown resilience, rebuilding and adapting after each hardship. Today, the Parisian Jewish community is diverse and vibrant, contributing extensively to the city's rich cultural tapestry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Using warm water and soap, apply a washcloth to gently wash out your new piercing. Keeping dirt, grime, and bacteria away from the wound should be enough to prevent infection. Be sure to clean the piercing after exercise, going outside, cooking, or cleaning. Rubbing alcohol, though it kills bacteria, will dry out your skin and potentially cause an infection. While you could buy saline at the piercing parlor, you can also make it at home with only 2 ingredients. Mix 1/8 tablespoon of non-iodized sea salt into a cup of distilled water and stir until it dissolves. Submerge your piercing in the saltwater, or soak a clean cotton swab in the water and apply it to the piercing for 20 minutes twice a day. Dirty hands are the number one cause of infection, so always wash your hands before touching or treating your piercing. If you have a piercing that is constantly rubbing on your clothes, wear looser clothing. This is especially true for navel, genital, nipple, or other body piercings. These places are hot-spots of moisture and bacteria that commonly lead to infections. Your piercing is an open wound and it will absorb bacteria much more readily then unbroken skin. Don’t freak out if you see redness or soreness in the first few days after a piercing. This is your body’s normal response to a puncture. Inflammation is common and can be easily treated with an ice-pack and ibuprofen. If the inflammation lasts for more than 3-5 days, however, you may be developing an infection. While it may seem counterintuitive, you should avoid removing the jewelry if you notice signs of active infection, such as pus, since removing the jewelry can cause the piercing to close up and trap the infection inside your body. It's important that the piercing remain open so that it can drain; otherwise, you may develop an abscess or worsen the existing infection.

The Winnipeg Public Library is a public library network with 20 branches throughout the city, including the main Millennium Library.Winnipeg the Bear, which would become the inspiration for part of the name of Winnie-the-Pooh, was purchased in Ontario by Lieutenant Harry Colebourn of the Fort Garry Horse. He named the bear after the regiment's home town of Winnipeg. A. A. Milne later wrote a series of books featuring the fictional Winnie-the-Pooh. The series' illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, created the only known oil painting of Winnipeg's adopted fictional bear, displayed in Assiniboine Park.The city has developed many distinct dishes and cooking styles, notably in the areas of confectionery and hot-smoked fish.

Sentence 2: It was also distributed in Japan, the United States (where it was first banned, then released in a heavily cut version), England, and France. The components, in terms of the action and locations, are the same. The sequence of locations differs, but the meaning remains the same. Step 3: Assess if any differences make a significant impact on the meaning. There are two small variations in wording: 1. Sentence 1 uses \\"distributed to\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"distributed in.\\" This change does not affect the overall meaning as both phrases indicate the item was distributed in those countries. 2. Sentence 1 uses \\"published in a heavily cut version\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"released in a heavily cut version.\\" The meaning remains almost the same, but \\"published\\" is usually used for print materials (like books), while \\"released\\" is a more general term that can refer to any kind of distribution, including digital.

He had love affairs and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked them as much as they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and bought a house in Belgravia.Walton's first major composition after Belshazzar's Feast was his First Symphony. It was not written to a commission, and Walton worked slowly on the score from late 1931 until he completed it in 1935. He had composed the first three of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor Hamilton Harty. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work. The end of his affair with Imma von Doernberg coincided with, and may have contributed to, a sudden and persistent writer's block. Harty persuaded Walton to let him perform the three existing movements, which he premiered in December 1934 with the London Symphony Orchestra. During 1934 Walton interrupted work on the symphony to compose his first film music, for Paul Czinner's Escape Me Never (1934), for which he was paid £300.After a break of eight months, Walton resumed work on the symphony and completed it in 1935. Harty and the BBC Symphony Orchestra gave the premiere of the completed piece in November of that year. The symphony aroused international interest. The leading continental conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler and Willem Mengelberg sent for copies of the score, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra premiered the work in the US under... contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who disliked the Sitwells?, what is it ?

Build a movie plot around this: What was Freddy's job at the preschool? He was a gardener. A:","completion":"Step 1: Introduce the main characters and setup The central character of the movie is Freddy, a kind and introverted man in his 40s who loves nature and enjoys working as a gardener at Little Sprouts preschool. Freddy is awkward when it comes to social interactions but has a genuine and unique connection with plants, often \\"talking\\" to them. Ms. Esther is the dedicated and warm-hearted principal of the preschool. She has a soft spot for Freddy and sees his unique bond with the plants as a way to teach children about nature and empathy. The preschool teachers and children love Freddy and deeply appreciate his gardening work, and he has become an essential part of the school community. Step 2: Introduce the conflict A newly hired school administrator, Mr. Johnson, who adheres to strict rules and regulations, doesn't see the value in Freddy's unusual methods of gardening and tries to have him replaced with a modern landscaping company. Freddy faces the possibility of losing his job at the preschool, which brings immense sadness to him and the school community. Step 3: Develop the story Ms. Esther and the preschool teachers decide to support Freddy by showcasing his unique contributions to the school. They organize a special event focused on the importance of nature, creativity, and empathy in education. The event embraces Freddy's unique gardening style, which includes presenting how the plants and flowers have made positive impacts on the children's emotions and learning. Meanwhile, Freddy feels discouraged but decides to give it his best shot when he learns about the supportive event from Ms. Esther. He starts designing an extraordinary garden filled with flowers that represent each child's personality and progress in school. Step 4: Climax and resolution On the day of the event, the preschool hosts multiple guests including parents, teachers from other schools, and school board members. Freddy's garden captures everyone's attention, making the school community immensely proud. As Mr. Johnson observes the positive impact Freddy has on the children, he starts to see the value of Freddy's abilities and his unique connection to nature. Seeing Freddy's dedication and the strong support of the school community, Mr. Johnson has a change of heart and decides to keep Freddy as the school's gardener. Step 5: Wrap up the story Freddy's exceptional gardening provides opportunities beyond the walls of the preschool. His refreshing approach to horticulture inspires other schools to incorporate green spaces and nature-related education in their curricula. The movie ends with Freddy teaching a group of children about plants in his now-famous garden, where he continues to foster the growth of both nature and the hearts of those who visit.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Who took more overall casualties from bombings?\\" is in \\"The bombing failed to demoralise the British into surrender or significantly damage the war economy. The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production and the war industries continued to operate and expand. The Blitz was only authorised when the Luftwaffe had failed to meet preconditions for a 1940 launch of Operation Sea Lion, the provisionally planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East. In comparison to the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany, the Blitz resulted in relatively few casualties; the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 inflicted some 42,000 civilian deaths, about the same as the entire Blitz.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"The passage provided contains information about the Blitz and its impact on Britain during World War II but does not explicitly answer the question of who took more overall casualties from bombings. It does, however, draw a comparison between the Blitz and the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany. From the passage, we learn that the British war industries continued to operate and expand despite the bombings, and that the Blitz itself resulted in relatively fewer casualties compared to later bombing campaigns in the war. The passage mentions that the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 alone inflicted around 42,000 civilian deaths, which is equivalent to the entire number of casualties during the Blitz. To determine which side of the conflict took more overall casualties from bombings, we would need additional information and data on casualties caused by bombings throughout the entire course of the war on both British and German sides. From the information provided, we can infer that the bombing campaign against Germany had a larger number of casualties in specific instances, such as the bombing of Hamburg in 1943. However, without the full scope of the casualties on both sides throughout the entire war, it is difficult to definitively answer the question of who took more overall casualties from bombings."},{"prompt":"Given the question: \\"HMS Archer (P264)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Many observers point to Moscow's close ties with Damascus going back to the 1950s as a reason for Russia now acting to defend the al-Assad regime in Syria against its many internal and external opponents. What has apparently been forgotten is that Moscow's ties with Syria have been plagued by tensions and disagreements throughout this entire period. Underpinning the Moscow-Damascus relationship for over half a century now has been a common antipathy toward America, Israel, and the moderate Arab states. But they have also differed on many issues. When Soviet-Syrian relations first became close during the mid-1950s, Moscow seemed to hope the then-powerful Syrian Communist Party might at least share power with the virulently anti-Israeli and anti-Western Baath Party. But the Syrian Baathists feared the communists and agreed to the 1958 merger of their country with Egypt and even accepted the leadership of the latter's ruler, Nasser, partly in order to get his help in suppressing the communists. Moscow restored ties with OPTIONS: - Afghanistan, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - America, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Arab, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Baathists, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Damascus, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Egypt, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Israel, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Middle East, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Moscow, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Nasser, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Russia, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Soviet, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Syria, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Syrian, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Syrian Communist Party, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - Tartus, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - USSR, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - al-Assad, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. - anti-Western Baath Party, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there.","completion":"Damascus, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there.

Randy is always late for the first period while Joseph is always on time as Select from: [-] Randy is a night owl.. [-] Joseph is a night owl..","completion":"Randy is always late for the first period, while Joseph is always on time. The reason for their contrasting punctuality lies in their sleep habits. Randy is a night owl, meaning he tends to stay up late at night, resulting in difficulty waking up early in the morning. This negatively impacts Randy's ability to arrive on time for the first period at school. As Randy's body clock is naturally inclined towards late-night hours, his productivity and alertness do not peak until later in the day. Consequently, it is challenging for him to establish a routine that aligns with early morning school hours. Despite knowing the importance of punctuality, Randy struggles to break free from his night owl tendencies. On the other hand, Joseph is not a night owl. He maintains a consistent sleep schedule, focusing on getting a sufficient amount of rest daily. This enables Joseph to wake up refreshed and ready to tackle the day ahead. Joseph's alignment with a healthy sleep pattern allows him to easily adapt to early morning commitments, such as arriving on time for the first period at school. In contrast to Randy, Joseph's peak productivity and alertness occur earlier in the day, making him better suited to adhering to a traditional school schedule. In conclusion, Randy's night owl tendencies contribute to his chronic tardiness for the first period, while Joseph's more balanced sleep habits enable him to consistently arrive on time. It demonstrates the significant impact that sleep patterns have on an individual's ability to function effectively in society, particularly when it comes to punctuality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In diesem Zusammenhang ist es wichtig, sowohl die Faktoren zu verstehen, die zum Reichtum als auch zur Armut in Bolivien beitragen. Das südamerikanische Land verfügt über eine Vielzahl natürlicher Ressourcen, wie etwa Erdgas, Erdöl, Zinn, Silber und Gold. Diese haben dazu beigetragen, dass der Exportsektor des Landes beachtliche Einnahmen erzielt. Darüber hinaus spielt auch Landwirtschaft, insbesondere der Anbau von Soja, Mais, Zuckerrohr und Quinoa, eine wichtige Rolle für die Wirtschaft. Bolivien zeichnet sich ebenso durch eine reiche kulturelle Vielfalt und eine beeindruckende Landschaft aus, die für den Tourismussektor von großer Bedeutung sind. Trotz dieses Reichtums an natürlichen Ressourcen leiden viele Menschen in Bolivien unter erheblichen sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Problemen, die sich in hoher Armut und sozialer Ungleichheit widerspiegeln. Ein Grund dafür ist die ungleiche Verteilung von Ressourcen und Chancen innerhalb der Bevölkerung, was dazu führt, dass große Teile der Einkünfte nur wenigen zugutekommen. Eine lange Geschichte der politischen Instabilität, Korruption und ineffektiver Regierungsführung hat ebenso zur Armut und sozialen Ungleichheit im Land beigetragen. Die hohen Raten von Landlosigkeit und das Fehlen von Zugang zu grundlegenden Dienstleistungen, wie Bildung und Gesundheitsversorgung, verschärfen die Situation weiter. Um die Armut in Bolivien zu bekämpfen, müssen gleichwertige Chancen für alle geschaffen werden, unabhängig von ihrer sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Stellung in der Gesellschaft. Dazu sollten mehr investiert werden in Bereiche wie Bildung, Gesundheitsversorgung, Infrastruktur, soziale Sicherheit und Armutsbekämpfung. Auf diese Weise können die wirtschaftliche und soziale Ungleichheit verringert werden, während die Lebensbedingungen der ärmeren Bevölkerungsgruppen verbessert werden. Es ist jedoch anzumerken, dass in den letzten Jahren einige Fortschritte erzielt wurden, um die Situation der benachteiligten Bevölkerungsgruppen in Bolivien zu verbessern, insbesondere unter der Präsidentschaft von Evo Morales.

Proper coverage: Dipping a brush in paint ensures that you get the adequate amount of paint needed to properly cover the surface of the barn doors. By dipping the brush in paint, you can control the amount of paint that you pick up and apply. This, in turn, contributes to a consistent paint application and finish. 2. Efficiency: By using paint directly, you work more efficiently since you do not need to go through an extra step of diluting the paint with thinner. This saves time and effort in the long run. 3. Durability: Using paint without diluting it with paint thinner ensures that the barn doors receive a thicker and more durable coat of paint. A more durable coat of paint will stand up to wear and tear and protect the doors better over time. 4. Color consistency: Applying paint directly without dilution maintains the color consistency of the paint. If you dilute the paint with thinner, it can change the hue or shade of the paint, making it challenging to achieve a uniform and desired color on the barn doors. Let's now briefly address why the first option is not as reasonable. Option 1: Dip a brush in paint thinner, then apply strokes to the doors until they're covered. Using paint thinner is not the most reasonable method to accomplish this goal for these reasons: 1. Inadequate coverage: Diluting the paint with thinner may make it more difficult to achieve proper coverage on the barn doors. The paint will be less dense and may require additional coats to achieve the desired appearance. 2. Time-consuming: As mentioned above, dilution with thinner may necessitate additional coats of paint adding to the time and effort required to complete the task, making this method less efficient. 3. Reduced durability: A diluted coat of paint will be less durable, offering less protection for the barn doors. 4. Color inconsistency: Diluting paint can lead to inconsistencies in color, making it challenging to achieve a uniform appearance. In conclusion, the most reasonable method for painting barn doors is to dip a brush in paint and then apply strokes to the doors until they're covered. This option ensures proper coverage, time efficiency, better durability, and color consistency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Pick from: (I) description; (II) entity; (III) abbreviation; (IV) human; (V) numeric; (VI) location;","completion":"God is a concept that transcends simple categorization, encompassing a myriad of dimensions including description, entity, and even human-made interpretations. Here, I will present different aspects to provide a comprehensive understanding of the concept of God. (I) Description: From a descriptive standpoint, God represents the ultimate source of goodness, power, and knowledge. Generally, God is conceived as the supreme being, the creator of the universe and everything in it, and the all-knowing, all-powerful, and ever-present entity. Many religions and belief systems contain some concept of God, though their interpretations and descriptions may differ significantly. God is often described using various attributes, such as omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence. Furthermore, God is frequently portrayed as possessing moral perfection, and as the defeater of evil. Across diverse belief systems, God is generally depicted as compassionate, loving, and forgiving, although descriptions of divine wrath and retribution are not uncommon. (II) Entity: God can also be seen as an entity or a group of entities. In monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, God is represented as a single, all-powerful being, who exercises ultimate control over creation. In contrast, polytheistic religions like Hinduism and ancient Greek and Roman religions encompass multiple gods and goddesses who possess unique abilities and dominion over specific aspects of the universe. Gods in these belief systems may be entities with anthropomorphic personalities, but they can also take the shape of abstract principles. (III) Abbreviation: Although \\"God\\" is not an abbreviation in any formal sense, it can symbolize the divine being or force present in various spiritual practices. \\"God\\" might stand for a more significant, foundational concept that supersedes specific religious or cultural characterizations. This abbreviation-like usage allows for a common understanding of a supreme being while still respecting the diverse beliefs held by people around the world. (IV) Human: Throughout history, some people have been regarded as gods or extensions of gods, as seen in Roman and Greek mythologies where demigods were believed to be half human, half god. Egyptian pharaohs were thought to be divine, and some individuals have claimed to be divine themselves, such as cult leaders and self-proclaimed prophets. It is essential to recognize that when \\"God\\" is associated with a human, it typically results from that person's claims or other people's beliefs in that individual's divinity, rather than the actual existence of a deity assuming human form. (V) Numeric: A numeric representation of God can be found in the concept of sacred numbers, which are believed to possess divine attributes or significance in certain religious or spiritual traditions. For example, in Christianity, the number 3 is considered sacred due to its association with the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). In Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism, the number 10 represents the Sefirot, ten attributes through which God interacts with the world. However, these numeric representations serve more as symbols of divine traits or principles, rather than as direct representations of God. (VI) Location: The concept of God is not tied to a specific location, as it generally encompasses an omnipresent and omnipotent being. Nonetheless, there are certain places considered sacred or divine due to their association with God or gods. Sacred sites might include temples, churches, mosques, shrines, or natural landmarks such as mountains or rivers. These locations are seen as places where the divine is particularly present and where humans can seek spiritual growth and connection to the divine. In conclusion, the term God and its understanding encompass various aspects, such as description, entity, and, to some extent, human association and interactions. The concept of God is complex and varied, as it is deeply rooted in cultural, religious, and spiritual belief systems across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel.

Here is a hypothesis: Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise states that Mr. Whittington forcefully brought his fist down upon the desk, producing a bang. This action can be interpreted as him performing a rapid movement with his fist to strike the desk, creating a loud noise as a result. The hypothesis posits that Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk. If we accept the premise as true, it logically follows that the hypothesis is true as well. This is because the premise directly demonstrates Mr. Whittington's ability to bang on the desk with his fist – an action that served as the key component for the resulting sound. In this scenario, the premise serves as evidence supporting the hypothesis. When we analyze the provided premise and assume it to be true, it becomes clear that Mr. Whittington did indeed use his fist to bang on the desk, thereby validating the hypothesis. To further elaborate, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their core components: 1. Premise: Mr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang. a. Mr. Whittington performed an action (bringing his fist down). b. He did this upon a desk. c. This action resulted in a loud noise (a bang). 2. Hypothesis: Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk. a. Mr. Whittington possessed the ability (was able) to perform an action. b. The action involved using his fist. c. The intended result of the action was to bang on the desk. When comparing the core components of both the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe the following: - The subjects (Mr. Whittington) and the core actions (using his fist to bang on the desk) align in both statements. - The premise demonstrates Mr. Whittington's ability to perform the action by providing a specific instance (bringing his fist down upon the desk with a bang). - The intended result of the action (a bang) further validates the assertion in the hypothesis that Mr. Whittington was able to use his fist to bang on the desk. Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, because the premise effectively substantiates the claim made in the hypothesis through direct demonstration of the action and its intended result."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas...

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that the Viola is named after? The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

Text: The pressure-gradient force is the force which results when there is a difference in pressure across a surface. In general, a pressure is a force per unit area, across a surface. A difference in pressure across a surface then implies a difference in force, which can result in an acceleration according to Newton's second law of motion, if there is no additional force to balance it. The resulting force is always directed from the region of higher-pressure to the region of lower-pressure. When a fluid is in an equilibrium state (i.e. there are no net forces, and no acceleration), the system is referred to as being in hydrostatic equilibrium. In the case of atmospheres, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the gravitational force, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. In Earth's atmosphere, for example, air pressure decreases at altitudes above Earth's surface, thus providing a pressure gradient force which counteracts the force of gravity on the atmosphere. Question: with regard to the pressure gradient force air will always move from low to high pressure? Available options: A). no B). yes","completion":"A). no The pressure-gradient force is always directed from the region of higher-pressure to the region of lower-pressure. This means that air will always move from high to low pressure, not from low to high pressure as stated in the question.

(CNN) -- Tito Joseph \\"TJ\\" Jackson, who on Wednesday was named temporary guardian of Michael Jackson's three children, was inspired by his famous uncle to form a singing group with his brothers. TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995. Eventually the brothers went along on one of his tours and decided to form a singing group and were recording their first album in 1994 at the time of their mother's death. Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her. Three years later, Donald Bohana was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, according to People magazine.

Answer a question about this article: Hitler's interest in this strategy forced Göring and Jeschonnek to review the air war against Britain in January 1941. This led to Göring and Jeschonnek agreeing to Hitler's Directive 23, Directions for operations against the British War Economy, which was published on 6 February 1941 and gave aerial interdiction of British imports by sea top priority. This strategy had been recognised before the war, but Operation Eagle Attack and the following Battle of Britain had got in the way of striking at Britain's sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting structures. The OKL had always regarded the interdiction of sea communications of less importance than bombing land-based aircraft industries. What was a top priority of Directive 23?","completion":"Directive 23, titled \\"Directions for Operations Against the British War Economy,\\" was issued by Adolf Hitler on 6 February 1941, as a result of his interest in reviewing the air war strategy against Britain. Under Directive 23, the top priority was to focus on aerial interdiction of British imports by sea. This essentially meant that the German air forces (Luftwaffe) would concentrate their efforts on disrupting and hindering the flow of essential goods and resources to Britain by attacking and targeting maritime shipping and transportation routes. Before Directive 23, the strategy of attacking Britain's sea communications had been recognized but was deprioritized due to Operation Eagle Attack and the subsequent Battle of Britain. These events diverted German airpower towards the campaign against the Royal Air Force (RAF) and its support structures, with the aim of achieving air superiority over Britain. As a result, interdiction of sea communications was considered of lesser significance compared to bombing land-based aircraft industries by the German High Command (OKL). Therefore, Directive 23 marked a strategic shift in the German approach to the Battle of Britain by emphasizing the importance of targeting and disrupting Britain's vital maritime trade and communication routes to weaken the British war economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Variety: A big city offers a wider range of dining options, cuisines, and restaurants compared to a small town. This allows individuals to try new culinary experiences and enjoy a broader range of flavors and tastes. 2. Quality: Restaurants in bigger cities often have access to better ingredients, skilled chefs, and state-of-the-art cooking equipment. This results in a higher overall quality of meals and dining experiences. 3. Atmosphere: Dining in a big city can also come with benefits in terms of ambiance, entertainment, and overall atmosphere. Many restaurants in cities often have a more vibrant atmosphere with better lighting, decor, and music, making the dining experience more enjoyable. 4. Special occasions: When people want to celebrate special occasions or have a particularly memorable night out, they may be more likely to head to a big city where there are more upscale, unique, or highly-rated dining establishments to choose from. 5. Networking opportunities: People who visit big cities for a meal might also consider it a chance to network and socialize with others, something that could be more difficult to do in a small town setting.

Q: Abstract: Helicobacter hepaticus has been reported to induce colitis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in several different murine models. The aim of this study was to determine if H. hepaticus will cause colitis in monoassociated mice lacking the interleukin-10 gene (IL-10(-/-) mice) and potentiate colitis in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) IL-10(-/-) mice. Germfree IL-10(-/-) mice on either a mixed (C57BL/6 x 129/Ola) or inbred (129/SvEv) genetic background were monoassociated with H. hepaticus ATCC 51448 by oral feeding and rectal enemas. In a second experiment, germfree IL-10(-/-) mice were colonized with stool from SPF mice that harbored or did not harbor endogenous H. hepaticus. After 7 to 9 weeks of colonization, weight loss and mortality were assessed, the colon was isolated for histology and IL-12 secretion, and mesenteric lymph node cells were assessed for T-cell activation markers. It was found that IL-10(-/-) mice monoassociated with H. hepaticus for up to 16 weeks showed almost no histologic colitis or increased IL-12 production. SPF IL-10-knockout mice had no significant difference in weight loss, mortality rate, histologic scores, colonic IL-12 secretion, or T-cell activation with or without H. hepaticus. We conclude that H. hepaticus does not induce or potentiate disease in our IL-10(-/-) mice and therefore is not required to induce colitis in genetically susceptible hosts..

It was dredged and widened in 1974 , built with gravel roads on each side of the channel .","completion":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia appear to convey similar information, they do possess subtle differences in their meaning and structure which affect the overall interpretation of the event described. 1. \\"It was built and widened in 1974, with gravel roads dredged on each side of the canal.\\" In this sentence, the primary action is \\"built and widened,\\" which implies that the subject (\\"it\\") was both created and expanded in 1974. The additional information about the gravel roads being dredged on each side of the canal serves as supplementary context. Dredging typically involves removal of sediments or other materials from a water body to improve depth or navigability. Here the use of \\"dredged\\" in reference to gravel roads suggests that materials were removed in the process of constructing the roads adjacent to the canal. 2. \\"It was dredged and widened in 1974, built with gravel roads on each side of the channel.\\" In this sentence, the primary actions are \\"dredged and widened,\\" meaning \\"it\\" was primarily subjected to improvement through sediment removal and expansion in 1974. The phrase \\"built with gravel roads on each side of the channel\\" could be interpreted as the initial construction phase of the subject. Furthermore, the use of \\"channel\\" instead of \\"canal\\" adds ambiguity: channels can refer to natural or human-made watercourses, whereas canals are usually human-made. While the meaning is largely similar, in this sentence the focus is on dredging as a primary action, with the addition of gravel roads serving as supplementary contextual information. In conclusion, the two sentences share a similar overall meaning regarding a watercourse's development in 1974, yet the distinction in the primary and secondary actions, as well as the choice of \\"canal\\" versus \\"channel\\", can impact how these events are understood. The first sentence emphasizes construction and expansion, noting that gravel roads were dredged on either side, while the second places focus on dredging and widening, mentioning the building of gravel roads as additional information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is seen as either the perfect example of artisanal food or as a strange, smelly dairy product best avoided unless it's topping a pizza or hamburger. Of course, it’s not really that simple. Cheese has been an important source of protein for centuries. It has a long shelf life and can be produced indefinitely if you have a healthy, milk-producing animal. Where cows aren't readily available, goat's milk is a typical substitute. However, the world's most expensive and unusual cheese comes from neither cows nor goats. Pule cheese (pronounced pullay) is made only in Serbia and fetches the highest price of any cheese on Earth. In 2012, a batch of pule was sold for the “discounted” price of 576 per pound. On the open market, gourmands can expect to pay well over 1,000 per pound. The milk used to make this cheese comes from a very unusual source: the endangered Balkan donkey. The process of producing pule is what makes it literally worth its weight in gold. For starters, there are no automated milking machines for donkeys. The animals have to be milked by hand three times per day. They also produce a very small amount of milk; it takes more than 15 donkeys to yield 1 gallon of milk per day, and roughly 3.5 gallons of milk make 1 pound of pule. The story behind pule's spike in popularity goes beyond its source. A rumor involving one of Serbia's most famous sons earned the little-known cheese plenty of media buzz in 2012. Tennis star Novak Djokovic was said to have used his tournament winnings to purchase the entire supply of pule — a rumor that later turned out to be false. The world's supply of pule comes from a herd of Balkan donkeys that live on the Zasavica Special Nature Preserve. Once extensively used as pack animals by rural Serbs, the domesticated donkeys were replaced with modern modes of hauling and slaughtered or turned out during tough economic times. Today, workers at the Zasavica preserve see pule production as a way to promote the conservation of the endangered species. In addition to cheese, donkey's milk is also an ingredient in beauty products. Ancient Egyptian queen Cleopatra is famously said to have used the milk as a skin treatment. So how exactly does pule taste? A crumbly white cheese, it is known for its intense flavor and natural saltiness. It will likely appeal to cheese aficionados, but for others, a block of cheddar or Swiss from the local supermarket is probably money better spent. Related stories on MNN: ||||| Photo Donkey cheese is irresistible, or at least articles about it are. A week ago, several British newspapers, notably The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Mail, reported that Novak Djokovic, the top-ranked men’s tennis player, had bought the entire world supply of pule, a Serbian donkey cheese, for his restaurants. The cheese, produced on a lone farm on Zasavica, a nature reserve west of Belgrade, had already made a small splash for its exorbitant price. At 1,000 euros per kilo, or about 600 per pound, it seemed to have inched past moose cheese to top the list of the world’s most expensive cheeses. Now it was poised for stardom, lofted skyward by Mr. Djokovic’s golden racket. On Sunday, it made an appearance on the NPR quiz show, “Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me!” It was offered as the one true story among three wildly improbably choices. One problem. Mr. Djokovic has never bought so much as a gram of pule. Responding to a series of e-mail questions about pule, Jovan Vukadinovic, a manager at Zasavica, concluded with a rather deflating piece of information. “Novak Djokovic never bought our cheese,” he wrote. What happened, he explained, was this: Slobodan Simic, the farm’s donkey breeder, left a sample of the cheese with the manager of Mr. Djokovic’s restaurant in Belgrade, offering to let the restaurant have an exclusive on the product. He still awaits a reply. “That is the only truth, and the rest are made up by journalists,” Mr. Vukadinovic wrote. The Daily Mail, hot on the trail of pule, sent a reporter named Robert Hardman to Serbia for a tasting. When he discovered that the Djokovic story was shaky, he buried the bad news deep in the story and swathed it in a few layers of obfuscation, suggesting that Mr. Simic is now “waiting to clinch the deal.” The waiting seems more likely than the clinching. But if Mr. Djokovic does want to corner the donkey-cheese market, the farm plans to produce 100 kilos of it next year. That would set Mr. Djokovic back about 132,000, or about two serves and a cross-court return. About the cheese. Pule, which means “foal” in Serbo-Croatian, made its international debut in September at the annual cheese show in Frome, Somerset. Connoisseurs scratched their heads. The Balkan asses that produce the milk are traditional, but the cheese itself is new, an idea hatched by Mr. Simic as a way of bringing attention to his donkeys. He supplies the milk, and Stevo Marinkovic, a cheesemaker at Beocapra, a nearby goat farm and dairy, makes the cheese. Charles Campion, a British food writer who sampled pule at the show, described it as tasting not unlike a Spanish manchego, but with “a fusty-musty flavor.” A quick survey of cheese shops, markets, cheese publications and Serbian restaurants in the United States and abroad uncovered a knowledge deficit. Rare was the expert who had even heard of donkey cheese, much less tasted it, with the notable exception of Roland Barthélemy, the president of the International Cheese Guild. We reached out to Greg O’Neil, an owner of Pastoral, a specialty cheese shop in Chicago, which has the largest Serbian population in the United States. “We have never been asked for it, and I’m not sure if it’s salable in the U.S.,” he said. “I’ve eaten yak cheese from Mongolia,” he added, helpfully. “Very gamy.” Most of those who were queried either fell silent or laughed in disbelief. One or two knew of it by hearsay. “It’s kitschy, expensive and Eastern European,” said Julia Lowry, a cheesemonger at Cowgirl Creamery in San Francisco. At City Fresh Market in Chicago, Danny Kovacevic and his brother, Ray, specialize in Eastern European foods. They have feta cheeses in all varieties. They have kaymak, a soft cheese sold salted and unsalted. They do not have donkey cheese. “Back home, from Montenegro all the way down the Dalmatian coast, people drank the milk,” Danny Kovacevic said. “It was a home remedy, especially for kids with bronchitis. I have an 86-year-old aunt who drank it. But cheese?” His voice trailed off. Well, there’s cheese now. And Mr. Simic is said to be working on a line of donkey-milk liqueurs. ||||| “Well and what’s cheese? Corpse of milk,” said James Joyce. Cheese is probably the most popular dairy product in the world and there are a lot of “corpses of milk” around: some of which are rare and incredibly expensive. Here are the 5 highest priced cheeses in the world. 5. Caciocavallo Podolico – 70 euro/kg; US 42/pound This cheese, meaning “Horse Cheese,” is traditional and very popular in the south of Italy. It is not made from horse’s milk, rather its name originates from the fact that in the past, it was hung from horses so it could be transported during curing. Caciocavallo has a pear shape and a creamy white filling. It comes from the milk of a rare Italian breed of cow (only 25,000 exist) called the Podolica, which only lactates from May to June. 4. Bitto storico – 245 euro/kg; US 150/pound This rare Italian cheese is aged and prestigious: the oldest block is from 1996 and is stored in the Sanctuary of Bitto, in Gerola Alta, where the cheese is produced. A whole cheese aged 16 years and weighing 20 kg (44 pounds) was sold to ProFood Hong Kong, which will distribute small portions of the cheese to several resellers all around China. 3. Moose Cheese – Over 500/kg; US 300/pound Produced in Sweden by the Moose House, this cheese is made only from the milk of Gullan, Haelga, and Juno. These three cows were abandoned by their mother and adopted by the Johannson family. Moose only lactate from May to September and require the most tender of handling during milking since disturbances can cause the animals to get flustered and dry-up. Each animal produces about 5 liters (1.3 gallons) of milk per day, so each year the farm can only offer 300 kg (660 pounds) of cheese. The cheese contains 12 percent fat and 12 percent protein. 2. White Stilton Gold – 700 euro/kg ; US 420/pound One of the few British cheeses labeled PDO (Protected Denomination Origin), White Stilton Gold is made by Clawson, the producer of White and Blue Stilton. Stilton is called ‘The King” of British cheeses and only six creameries in the world are allowed to make it. The White Gold, suitable for dessert, is as creamy as the plain White, with the difference that it is crumbly—and it contains real gold. 1. Pule (or “donkey’s pet” in Serbian) – 1,000 euro/kg; US 600/pound Only available on demand, this unique cheese strengthens the immune system, since it is low in fats and rich in vitamins and proteins. It is made of smoked donkey’s milk, and is produced only in the Balkans by Zasavica Special Nature Reserve, home to a hundred donkeys. They affirm that the high price is due to the amount of milk required to make 1 kg of cheese: 25 liters (3 gallons to make 1 pound). Female donkeys are milked manually, since there are no suitable machines to do the job. ||||| Slobodan Simić lounged on the crude wooden bench in Zasavica Special Nature Reserve’s dining room like the caterpillar from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, holding court and puffing on the quarter-bent Calabash-style briar pipe that dangled delicately from his teeth. Tanned creases ran down his face like tributaries, and his eyes sparkled with mischief. “Rakia?” he said, offering me a shot of the strong Balkan brandy that is often drunk in the morning, even before coffee. “Ne, hvala,” I replied, shaking my head and thanking him. Instead, I accepted a cup of thick Turkish coffee accompanied by a shot glass of donkey milk from Zasavica’s herd. It was my first time tasting the sweet milk; I was even more eager to try the donkey cheese, a delicacy I’d learned about a few years back when rumours swirled that Serbian tennis ace Novak Djokovic was buying up their entire stock for his restaurants. Although the rumours were untrue, they brought global attention to Zasavica – and Serbia. Despite being a nature lover, Simić never set out to create a farm. Twenty years ago, the former MP-turned-conservationist remembered that he’d heard about some wetlands in west-central Serbia. His ex-wife’s parents, who lived in a nearby village, took him to see them. “I fell in love immediately,” he said. Zasavica, named after the river that runs through it, is located just 90km northwest of Belgrade, but the 1,825-hectare area was virtually undiscovered. The place is ripe for bird watching, and in the summer, hues are so vibrant they seem otherworldly. With the help of his political contacts, Simić transformed the wild marshland into a nature reserve in 1997. Three years later, Simić was at a fair in the nearby town of Ruma and saw some abused Balkan donkeys. No longer needed for work or transportation, they’d been beaten and were in bad shape. He had the idea to rescue them and bring them to Zasavica. Today, 180 Balkan donkeys, smaller than most donkeys and marked with crosses on their backs, roam the verdant marshland. Other native animals were added, including the Mangalica, related to the Hungarian “curly pig”, and the Podolian cow, originating from the European wild cow. Beavers were also reintroduced to the area. “We lost contact with animals, and we need that contact,” Simić said. But I’d come for the donkeys. More specifically, for the donkey milk cheese, which is the most expensive cheese in the world due to the extremely low milk yield of the magarica (female donkey): just 300 millilitres per day. Rich in vitamins and minerals, donkey milk is believed to slow down the ageing process and has been used as an immunity booster in the Balkans since ancient times. Cleopatra allegedly even bathed in it. It is also purported to boost virility. “If you drink our milk, you can even sleep with your own wife,” joked Simić, who has been married three times. Simić had the notion to produce donkey milk cheese a few years ago. “He is full of crazy ideas, but he is always right,” said farm manager Jovan Vukadinović, a formidable former traffic police chief with a near-white moustache that resembled a bristle brush. No one had produced cheese from donkey milk before, and it took some experimentation. Stevan Marinković, a dairy technologist, was brought in to consult. Donkey milk doesn’t have enough casein to make cheese, so he compensated by adding goat milk to the mix. The winning formula, which Marinković is in the process of patenting, turned out to be 60% donkey milk and 40% goat milk. But despite there being no established rules for donkey milk (or donkey milk cheese) in Serbia, concerns arose over the use of unpasteurized milk, and Zasavica was forced to stop factory production of the cheese. In the meantime, until official regulations are determined, local cheese makers Zoran Nedić, Momčilo Budimirović and his assistant, Milena, are producing small amounts of donkey cheese with milk pasteurized at low levels for Zasavica in a room adjacent to Budimirović’s kitchen in the nearby village of Glušci. I sat at Budimirović’s dining table with Nedić, Vukadinović and Simić, who were chatting in rapid Serbian. Domaće crno vino (domestic red wine) and a wedge of white cheese were on the table. “Is this donkey cheese?” I asked. Vukadinović shook his head. “Goat cheese, so you can taste the difference.” It was tangy and crumbly, with a dark kora od hrast (oak bark) rind. Then, without much ceremony, Budimirović brought out a much smaller bell-shaped chunk of magareći sir (donkey cheese). It had a yellowish tinge, and was less crumbly than the goat cheese. This piece, the size of a cupcake, would sell for 50 euros, I was told. Nedić cut me a slice. Its flavour was sweet, clean and mild, unlike any cheese I had ever tasted. We headed to the cheese room to see how it was made. That day, the trio of cheese makers were crafting goat cheese, but they explained donkey cheese is essentially made the same way – although the exact method is a secret. Rennet is added to the milk to help it coagulate, and the curds are strained and hand packed into moulds. The cheese stays in the mould for 24 hours, then it is removed and refrigerated in a large trailer cooler in Budimirović’s yard. This media cannot be played on your device. Zasavica also sells donkey milk cosmetics, such as donkey milk soap and anti-ageing face creams, which contain essential fatty acids and high levels of vitamin A; and donkey milk liqueur that tastes like milky Limoncello. The reserve, which has been supported by international grants, is working to become self-sustaining. Selling animal products is part of that plan, as is camping: Zasavica was rated among the 100 best campsites in Europe in 2013 and 2014. We made something in the middle of the nothing “We made something in the middle of the nothing,” Vukadinović said. “We always have to find new ways to survive. It’s easy when they say ‘sustainable tourism’, but it’s not easy. We want to be the best. We know we can’t change the world, we can’t change Serbia, but we always want to do just a little better than normal. That is our mission.” Just before I left, Vukadinović and I took a walk through the reserve. Donkeys grazed on shrubbery and frolicked in the grass. They nuzzled, cleaned each other and nursed. A grey donkey ambled toward me. “She’s pregnant,” Vukadinović said. “A magarica can be pregnant for more than a year.” I reached out and rubbed her forehead, fingering her coarse hair. She nuzzled my hand and leaned her body into mine. When we turned to leave she followed me, nudging for more attention. “They are very intelligent and social,” Vukadinović said. He bent down and hugged her neck. “This is very good for the stress.” We sat down at a picnic table for lunch. Sun illuminated the flat landscape, highlighting various shades of green – moss, pine, fern ­­– against a clear blue sky. Frogs sang. A stork soared overhead, landing on her nest atop Zasavica’s 18m-high watchtower. Vukadinović brought out a plate of cured meats: Mangalica sausage, speck and donkey sausage. I cringed a little. “Try it,” he urged, gesturing to the donkey sausage. This was one of their products I had not planned to sample. “How do you choose which donkeys are made into sausage?” I said. He explained that male donkeys sometimes become interested in their daughters, and then “it’s sausage time for them.” I speared a mottled slice with a toothpick. The fatty meat was tough and slightly gamey. Even eating an incestuous donkey felt wrong after communing with these gentle creatures – but Zasavica embraces the cycle of life, replete with its imperfections. Here you can go back to a way of living that has all but disappeared, when people cured their own meats and made their own cheese. You can experience virgin nature. You can believe, even for a moment, the local legend: on this land there was too much sun from Christ, which forever marked the Balkan donkey with a cross pattern on its coat, running down its spine.

It is the most expensive cheese in the world because it comes from the milk of the endangered Balkan donkey. These donkeys have to be milked by hand three times a day, and they don't give a lot of milk, so it takes many donkeys to make just a little bit of cheese. To make one pound of pule cheese, you need around 3.5 gallons of milk! Pule cheese is known for its strong flavor and natural saltiness. It is very special and is only made in one place on Earth, so it costs a lot of money to buy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is an article: Those gigantic jackpots set people dreaming. I’m not immune to lottery fever. I hadn’t bought a lottery ticket of any kind for years, until last January, when the Powerball jackpot amounted to nearly 1.6 billion. That was one awesome number. We began talking about it at work. Two colleagues and I split a few tickets. We understood that we had almost no chance of winning, and didn’t care: It was fun. Behavior like ours seems to account for the rapid surge in lottery sales, bringing jackpots to a higher and higher level, Mr. Mehta suggests. Once the jackpot reaches a certain threshold — somewhere in the hundreds of millions, these days — people begin talking and rushing to buy tickets, including people who don’t typically buy lottery tickets, and the jackpot soars even higher. I have no problem with that on a personal level. In fact, if the lottery exceeds 1 billion again, I’ll probably buy a ticket again. I have dreams, too. But Mr. Mehta persuaded me to crunch the numbers to see what effects the government-sponsored lotteries are having on people who buy tickets regularly. The results are troubling. Consider that for state-run lotteries as a whole, only about 60 cents of every dollar goes back to ticket buyers in the form of winnings, an analysis of United States Census Bureau data shows. The flip side is that in the long run, players as a group lose about 40 percent of the money they put into the lottery, and the chances of a big win are vanishingly small. For the July 30 Powerball drawing, for example, the lottery sold roughly 74 million tickets across the country, the data indicates. In addition to the 487 million jackpot winner, lottery statistics show that one ticket won a tidy 2 million. Other people won money too, but they didn’t win much: Just under 4 percent of tickets — fewer than one in 25 — produced any winnings at all. And for 78 percent of those winning tickets, the prize was only 4. If you won one of those little prizes and had bought two tickets, you broke even for the day. For more than 96 percent of tickets, though, you simply kissed your money goodbye. In short, if your goal was actually to win money, your chances would be much better at the blackjack table in a casino. How much are people losing at state-run lottery games? For some of us, it’s a paltry sum, 10 or 20 a year. And a handful of people win multimillion-dollar pots. But for the millions of regular lottery players, it’s a different story. It takes a while to figure this out. But using publicly available lottery and census data, I estimate, very roughly, that millions of adults, perhaps as many as 50 million, are swallowing net losses that average 1,000 a year. (I used lottery estimates suggesting that roughly 20 percent of all players account for about three-quarters of all sales, and proceeded from there. Mr. Mehta does an elaborate version of this on his blog.) That’s a lot of money for a lot of people, and over a lifetime it could make the difference between a comfortable retirement and utter penury. In fact, if you were to invest that money in a diversified mutual fund every year from the age of 20 until 65, and it returned 5 percent annually, you would have a nest egg of about 150,000. When you realize that households in the United States had only a median net worth of 68,828 in 2011, according to the Federal Reserve, it’s clear that this forsaken nest egg is a significant amount of money. (I calculated the nest egg for an individual; statistically speaking, the Fed says, a household typically includes 1.8 adults, so the comparable nest egg would be about 270,000.) These numbers don’t take into account the impact on poorer people, who truly cannot afford to forgo such sums of money. And they don’t include the effects of taxes, which subtract from winnings. Money spent to play the lottery has already been taxed, while winnings, which are still subject to tax, are worth less than their face value. I’m not a puritan. I have no problem with gambling as a form of entertainment. If anybody wants to spend money this way, fine. But few people run these numbers themselves or, really, are equipped to do so: A recent study suggests that most Americans are not really financially literate. I suspect that few people fully understand the trade-offs they are making. At a minimum, the government ought to be doing no harm to its citizens, yet it appears to be promoting and benefiting from activities that are surely harming the life prospects of many people. It’s true, lottery revenue may help the government finance education and other programs, many of them quite worthwhile. Yet policy levers could be used in other ways. Local and state governments could instead engage in aggressive and creative marketing schemes that would actually improve our odds of attaining a decent financial future.

During the mid and late 1940s, the University was the target of critical editorials in the local African American press, letter-writing campaigns by churches and the local Urban League, and legal briefs by the NAACP intended to strip its tax-exempt status.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: To get a folded piece of paper to stay together, you can Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To get a folded piece of paper to stay together, the best course of action would depend on the specific purpose or intended outcome of the task. Two primary methods can help you achieve this goal: adhesive application and alternative folding techniques. Here is a detailed comparison of both methods, considering factors like ease of use, sturdiness, reusability, and aesthetics: 1. Adhesive Application In this method, you apply an adhesive substance to the paper to hold the folds together. The adhesives you might consider include: a. Glue: A wet adhesive that requires a few seconds to minutes before fully drying and bonding to the paper can be applied with a brush, applicator, or directly from a bottle. b. Double-sided tape: A dry adhesive, you can apply it to the paper precisely, providing a quick bond without waiting for the adhesive to dry. c. Glue stick: Similar to glue, but in a more solid form, a glue stick allows for more controlled application without the messiness of a liquid adhesive. d. Staples: Another option to keep the paper together. It requires a stapler and does not involve adhesive or drying time, but it may cause small punctures in the paper. Ease of Use: Glue, double-sided tape, and glue sticks are generally straightforward to use, although glue can be messy at times. Staples require a stapler and, although easy to use, can puncture the paper. Sturdiness: Double-sided tape and staples tend to provide the best sturdiness, while wet adhesive (glue) and glue sticks are more likely to come undone with rigorous use. Reusability: Papers bonded with adhesive can be separated but may result in tearing or damage. Staples are easily removable but leave puncture marks behind. Aesthetics: Depending on the type of adhesive and application technique, both glue and double-sided tape can produce barely noticeable seams. Staples may be more visually obvious and leave puncture marks. 2. Alternative Folding Techniques This method employs various folding techniques to keep the paper together without relying on adhesives. a. Origami: The art of folding paper into various shapes without adhesive or cutting. Origami techniques often result in intricately folded and interlocked papers that do not require adhesive to stay together. b. Interlocking Folds: By using inventive folding methods, you can create paper folds that interlock and hold without glue, tape, or staples. Examples include envelope-style folds or tucking one edge of the paper into another. Ease of Use: Origami and other alternative folding techniques can be more challenging than adhesive application and may require practice or tutorials. Sturdiness: Folds that interlock can be sturdy, but their overall resilience will depend on the quality of the fold and the type of paper used. Reusability: Using folding techniques allows for reusability, as you can easily unfold the paper and use it again without damage or residue. Aesthetics: Since no adhesive is used, there are no visible seams, and the result can be more aesthetically pleasing. In conclusion, both methods have their advantages and drawbacks, and the choice between adhesive application and alternative folding techniques depends on factors like ease of use, sturdiness, reusability, and aesthetics. For a relatively simpler and more straightforward approach, adhesives such as glue or tape may be more suitable. However, for a more visually appealing and reusable solution, folding techniques such as origami or interlocking folds can be more appropriate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Who was Harriet Hobson returning the watch for? Answer the above question based on the context below: Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up. Answer:","completion":"Harriet Hobson was returning the watch for Johnny O'Clock."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

For example, certain processes in quantum mechanics, relating to the weak nuclear force, are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.[citation needed]\\".

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature. Which P.D. took a less efficient approach in fighting crime? Hint: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be argued that Greenville P.D. took a less efficient approach to fighting crime. While there are concerns about the high costs of technology and potential lack of familiarity with information technology, it is important to weigh these against the benefits of implementing modern tools such as DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. These tools can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a police department in identifying and apprehending criminals. Grayville's extensive measures in these areas suggest a more proactive and advanced approach to fighting crime. However, it is essential to strike a balance between investing in technology and maintaining other essential aspects of law enforcement to ensure the most efficient and effective crime prevention strategy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him.

Q:When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night. Bruce Kugler Question: what is probably true about Bruce? Options: - not enough information - he is sensitive - he is thick skinned - he will find a new profession === The correct answer is A:","completion":"It is likely true that Bruce is sensitive. The situation described by Bruce showcases a traumatic and painful experience he underwent early in his career in the psychiatric unit of a private hospital. His recollection of the incident and the vividness of the details provided indicate that he was deeply affected by what happened. He specifically mentions feeling helpless and being plagued by the young man's face when trying to sleep at night. All of these factors point towards Bruce being sensitive to the suffering of others and the emotional toll it can take on him. Being sensitive, in this context, means that Bruce is highly attuned to the emotions and distress of those around him, particularly his patients. He could be empathetic and compassionate, which could be great qualities to have as a therapist. However, it may also mean that he bears the emotional weight of his patients' experiences, which can be mentally and emotionally draining. While there might not be enough information to accurately conclude whether Bruce would find a new profession or not, it is evident that such traumatic experiences can significantly impact mental health professionals. It can lead some individuals to reconsider their career choices or seek additional guidance and support to continue in their line of work. Moreover, Bruce's personal account of his experience doesn't provide enough information to infer that he is thick-skinned. In contrast, his emotional response and the described lasting effects of the incident suggest that he is more sensitive to the challenges and traumas faced in his profession. In conclusion, based on the given information, it is most probable that Bruce is sensitive, which may have both positive and negative implications for his work as a therapist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 463*t - 624*t - 4508 = 0 for t, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms (the terms with t) We need to combine the terms with t (463*t - 624*t) to simplify the equation. 463*t - 624*t = (463 - 624) * t = -161*t So, the equation becomes -161*t - 4508 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable t Now, we need to isolate the variable t by adding 4508 to both sides of the equation. -161*t - 4508 + 4508 = 0 + 4508 -161*t = 4508 Step 3: Solve for t To solve for t, divide both sides of the equation by -161. -161*t / -161 = 4508 / -161 t = -28 So, the answer to the equation 463*t - 624*t - 4508 = 0 is t = -28."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: convention, supermarket, theater, wedding, church Why is \\"wedding\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Wedding\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense when considering where people are likely to be joyous because it represents a significant and celebratory life event. Weddings are typically associated with happiness, love, and the coming together of family and friends to honor the union of two individuals. Through various customs, traditions, and emotional connections, weddings are widely perceived as being synonymous with joy. Here's a detailed examination of multiple factors that make weddings a joyous occasion for humans: 1. Celebration of love: A wedding is fundamentally a celebration of the love and commitment between two individuals. Love is a powerful emotion that brings happiness and joy to both the couple and the attendees of the wedding. The idea of two people promising to share their lives together and support each other is an affirming and uplifting concept that encompasses the essence of human relationships. 2. Social bonds: One of the key components of a wedding is the presence of friends, family, and other loved ones. People come together to witness the union and share their happiness and best wishes with the couple. Socializing, sharing stories, dancing, and mingling with others leads to a heightened sense of joy, making the atmosphere at weddings positive and enjoyable. 3. Cultural and religious significance: Weddings hold unique cultural and religious significance, with various customs and rituals being observed across different cultures and faiths. These practices often serve to remind the couple of their responsibilities and the importance of the commitment they are making, while also creating a shared experience for attendees that fosters a sense of connection and happiness. 4. Music, dancing, and entertainment: Music and dancing are integral parts of most wedding celebrations. These activities contribute to the joyous atmosphere by encouraging attendees to let loose, have fun, and enjoy themselves. Furthermore, the couple often hires entertainers or organizes special performances that add to the overall excitement and amusement of the event. 5. Emotional moments: Beyond all the revelry, weddings are also packed with emotional and heartfelt moments. Exchanging vows, hearing speeches from loved ones, and witnessing the couple's love story unfold can evoke strong feelings of sentimentality and happiness among attendees. 6. Shared memories: As a milestone event, weddings create lasting memories. Guests often walk away from the celebration with stories, pictures, and tokens that will become cherished mementos in years to come. Reflecting on these special moments can bring joy long after the event has transpired. In light of these factors, it is clear that weddings are an answer aligned with human common sense as to where people are likely to be joyous. It is an occasion of happiness, love, and social connection with elements of cultural, religious, and emotional significance that resonate with the fundamental aspects of human experience.

The word stems from the Latin adjective vacuus for \\"vacant\\" or \\"void\\". An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call \\"vacuum\\" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure. The Latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum.

The letters reveal that while filming David Lean's adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel, \\"A Passage To India,\\" in Bangalore, India, the Oscar-winner claims to have seen a ghost. In this newly discovered correspondence, Guinness wrote to his wife, describing his experience with the apparition. \\"A very conventional white ghost appeared,\\" he wrote. \\"An elderly... woman in grey white and heavily veiled.\\" His matter-of-fact tone seems to convey an eerie sense of calm in the face of such an extraordinary event, revealing the steadfast character of the esteemed actor. Alec Guinness, who passed away in 2000, was one of the most respected and versatile actors of his generation, starring in critically acclaimed and successful films such as \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets,\\" \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai,\\" \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" \\"Doctor Zhivago,\\" and eventually becoming known to a whole new generation of fans through his iconic portrayal of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy. The filming of \\"A Passage to India,\\" which brought him to the Indian subcontinent in the first place, would later help him secure an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Directed by David Lean, the film was lauded not only for its stellar cast and production values, but also for its ability to capture the complexities of British-Indian relationships in the early 20th century. Guinness's role as Professor Godbole added to the mystique and philosophical undertones of the movie. Yet, it seems that on one quiet evening in Bangalore, as Guinness sat in his room, he had an experience that few other cast or crew members have shared. His casual mention of this ghostly apparition speaks volumes about the man's courage and perhaps even his belief in the transcendental. In a way, this newly revealed encounter with the supernatural only adds another curious layer to the mystique surrounding Sir Alec Guinness. As an actor who truly immersed himself in his roles, one can only wonder how this brush with the otherworldly may have translated into his subsequent performances. The publication of these letters offers an intimate glimpse into the life of a celebrated actor. As we learn more about Guinness's fascinating personal life, including his encounters with the metaphysical, it gives us a newfound appreciation for the depth and range of his talents. Allowing us to remember Sir Alec Guinness not only as a versatile and legendary actor but also as a man who experienced, as his characters often did, that which lies beyond the mundane in this world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation. Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art. The term \\"cult film\\" itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though \\"cult\\" was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that. - Criminal law is the body of law that relates to crime. It regulates social conduct and proscribes whatever is threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people. It includes the punishment of people who violate these laws. Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Gina L.

Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Al Israel (April 16, 1935 March 16, 2011) was an American film and TV actor who is best known for his role as the Colombian drug dealer \\"Hector the Toad\\" in the 1983 cult film \\"Scarface\\".

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose, and perform their own musical material, including lyrics and melodies. - Carlito's Way is a 1993 American crime film directed by Brian De Palma, based on the novels \\"Carlito's Way\\" and \\"After Hours\\" by Judge Edwin Torres.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Given the background: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur. and the situation: The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation. Answer the following question: Which county experienced less runoff? Answer:","completion":"Saulk county experienced less runoff compared to Dirk county. In Dirk county, the steady rain led to massive water infiltration and many flood events, indicating a higher level of runoff as the ground reached its saturation point and could not absorb more water. Meanwhile, in Saulk county, the thunderstorms caused runoff but with less infiltration and soil saturation, suggesting the runoff was less extensive compared to Dirk county."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They occur when the immune system responds to a foreign substance, known as an allergen, causing symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and watery eyes. While some allergies are mild and easier to manage, others can be life-threatening. The following article provides a comprehensive guide to living comfortably with allergies. By adhering to these tips, individuals with allergies can maintain a good quality of life and prevent severe allergic reactions. 1. Avoid your triggers The first and foremost step to manage allergies is to identify and avoid the allergens that trigger your symptoms. Common triggers include pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and certain foods. This can be achieved by maintaining a diary to record your symptoms and their corresponding causes. Regularly review this diary to determine any patterns and discuss them with your healthcare provider. 2. Use caution when preparing food For those with food allergies, being mindful when preparing meals is crucial. Read food labels carefully and avoid cross-contamination by using separate utensils and cutting boards for different ingredients. Additionally, inform restaurant staff about your allergies when dining out and remind them to ensure your meal is prepared separately from allergenic ingredients. 3. Cut down on dust in your home Reducing dust accumulation is essential for managing allergies triggered by dust mites. Regularly clean your living space and vacuum carpets, as well as use allergen-proof covers for your pillows and mattress. Investing in an air purifier with a HEPA filter can also help to reduce airborne allergens in your home. 4. Control the movements of family pets Pet dander is another common allergen. Limit the areas where pets can roam within your home and avoid letting them sleep in your bedroom. Regularly bathe pets to reduce dander and consider using a HEPA air purifier to minimize airborne irritants. 5. Avoid insect bites when spending time outside For those with insect sting allergies, it's essential to protect yourself from bites and stings. Wear protective clothing outdoors, avoid using scented products that may attract insects, and keep food covered during picnics or outdoor events. Consult your doctor for appropriate treatment options if you're prone to severe reactions. 6. Inform all medical staff if you have a drug allergy A drug allergy can have serious consequences if not managed properly. Inform your healthcare providers about any known drug allergies to ensure they prescribe you safe and appropriate medications. 7. Keep your EpiPen with you EpiPens, or epinephrine auto-injectors, are lifesaving devices for people with severe allergies. Carry one with you at all times and familiarize yourself with its proper use. Make sure friends and family members are aware of your condition and know how to administer the EpiPen in case of an emergency. 8. Take your medication as directed Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to help manage your allergy symptoms, such as antihistamines or corticosteroids. It is essential to take these medications as directed to control your symptoms effectively and reduce the risk of severe reactions. 9. Get allergy shots Immunotherapy, or allergy shots, can be beneficial for individuals suffering from severe allergies that aren't adequately managed with medications alone. Speak with your healthcare provider about whether this treatment option is suitable for you. Conclusion Living with allergies can be challenging, but by implementing these essential tips and working closely with your healthcare provider, you can minimize your symptoms and enjoy a better quality of life. Remember that each individual's allergies are different, and it is vital to consult with your doctor to plan the best strategy to manage your specific needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets. As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called synthetic CDO enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Then he took a piece of iron the shape of the horse horse's foot , and clapped *it* on, and drove some nails through the shoe quite into its hoof, so that the shoe was firmly on Are \\"it\\" and \\"piece of iron\\" the same thing in the aforementioned sentence?","completion":"Yes, in the sentence provided, the pronoun \\"it\\" is referring back to the \\"piece of iron.\\" The iron is shaped into a form that mimics the horse's foot. After molding the iron, he proceeds to attach \\"it\\"-- the iron that now looks like a horseshoe-- to the horse's hoof. The necessity of the horseshoe comes from the need to protect the horse's hoof from any potential damage that may occur during its movement or work. The sentence employs this pronoun \\"it\\" to refer back to the piece of iron in order to avoid repetition and maintain sentence fluency. This is a common practice in English language in order to ensure that the sentences flow and maintain their clarity without being redundant or excessively verbose. This noun-pronoun relationship is an integral part of English grammar. In this case, it allows the audience to understand that the piece of iron has undergone a transformation-- it's been shaped to fit the horse's hoof-- and is being affixed as a horseshoe. When applied to the horse's foot, the familiar shape of the piece of iron becomes functional, acting as a protective barrier or pad for the softer, more sensitive structures of the hoof. The nails are driven through the shoe and into the hoof, not injuring the horse, but securing the shoe firmly in place. The horse's hoof has a thick insensitive part, like our nails, that doesn't cause any discomfort to the horse when the shoe is attached.

What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about a business proposition made by billionaire financier Carl Icahn to acquire Mylan Laboratories Inc., a leading US-based company that manufactures and distributes generic medicines. The offer, made for approximately 5.38 billion, is intended to prevent Mylan Laboratories from purchasing King Pharmaceuticals Inc., another pharmaceutical company. Carl Icahn's interest in acquiring Mylan Laboratories seems to be fueled by his apparent disagreement with Mylan's decision to purchase King Pharmaceuticals. As a major Mylan shareholder, Icahn may believe that the acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals would not be in the best interest of Mylan Laboratories or its investors. His intention to buy Mylan is therefore likely to be seen as a strategic move aimed at disrupting the proposed merger between the two pharmaceutical companies and possibly protecting Mylan's current position and value within the market. This text illustrates the complexity and dynamics of the business world, where major transactions and acquisitions can impact the direction and growth of companies in various industries. In this case, the pharmaceutical industry is at the center of attention, with one of its leading players, Mylan Laboratories, being subject to a potential change in ownership. The involvement of the influential figure, Carl Icahn, emphasizes the significance of the proposed acquisition and its potential implications for the industry. Overall, the text is about a high-stakes business maneuver that could alter the landscape of the pharmaceutical sector and potentially impact various stakeholders, including investors, employees, and consumers who rely on the products and services provided by the companies involved in this deal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Jonathan Elystan Rees said a lack of resources and lawyers in court as a result of less funding was making it difficult for staff to do their jobs. His criticism comes after the CPS was blamed for the collapse of a number of high-profile criminal cases in Wales. The government rejected claims budget cuts have affected the CPS' performance. The CPS said it had tried to protect prosecution lawyers from the reductions; its budget has been cut by 25% since 2010 and staff numbers have fallen by 2,400. Figures analysed by BBC Wales show the proportion of cases in Wales that did not make it to a full trial because of reasons relating to the CPS has gradually increased. In 2009, CPS faults accounted for about 16.5% of case failures in Wales, compared to 19.6% in 2014. Mr Rees, a representative of the Criminal Bar Association in Wales, said CPS staff were \\"operating with one hand tied behind their back at the moment\\" and often found themselves covering several courts at the same time. \\"If you have properly funded prosecution and properly funded defence scrutinising each other's positions and challenging the case of either side, you're going to get the right result - that's British justice, that's how it works,\\" he said. \\"When one side or, even worse, both sides, aren't firing on all cylinders because they're not properly funded, that's when you get room for errors to take place and corners to be cut, not deliberately but inadvertently, and that's when there's a risk of miscarriages of justice.\\" Siobhan Blake, deputy chief crown prosecutor for Wales, denied cases were not being properly scrutinised, adding it had a conviction rate of about 80% - an increase on previous years. \\"I'm very confident that we have highly-skilled, professional people who are extremely dedicated to the work that they do,\\" she said. The Treasury said the CPS budget settlement \\"protected core services\\", ensuring it had the resources needed to continue to tackle crime \\"effectively and efficiently\\". It added the UK legal aid system remained \\"one of the most generous in the world\\" with Â£1.6bn spent last year. Charges against two nurses due to stand trial for the neglect of patients at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend were dismissed last year after the court heard a computer log of patient records was unreliable. The judge described the prosecution's reliance on the log as \\"unrealistic\\" and \\"faintly desperate\\". In October 2015, misconduct charges against three council bosses were dropped just weeks before they were due to stand trial. The case collapse followed judges' criticism of prosecution lawyers for being unprepared at earlier hearings. A recent report from the CPS Inspectorate warned victims were being \\"let down\\" by poor communication from prosecution officials.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Traditional gender roles exist because a long time ago, people thought boys and girls should do different things. Just like we match colors to things like \\"pink is for girls\\" and \\"blue is for boys\\", people matched different jobs for girls and boys. This happened mostly because of the way boys and girls are built differently - boys are usually bigger and stronger, while girls can have babies. So, people thought that boys should do jobs that needed big muscles, like hunting or building things, and girls should stay home, take care of babies and do housework. Gender roles were determined this way by looking at what people thought boys and girls were good at. It's like choosing a toy truck for a boy and a doll for a girl, just because we think boys like trucks and girls like dolls. But really, any child can play with and enjoy any toy they want! Now, both of your questions are like asking about cookies and how they're made.

A: put on her clothes B: did this to show frustration C: did this to be polite A:","completion":"According to the context provided, Taylor got ready for the date and made sure to be on time. This indicates that Taylor was making an effort to create a positive impression on their date and demonstrate respect for their time. Therefore, the best answer to the question \\"Why did Taylor do this?\\" is C: did this to be polite. Being punctual and well-prepared for a date demonstrates that a person values the time and feelings of their date. It shows that they have taken the time and effort to make this event special and that they care about making a strong impression. Arriving on time also helps to create a comfortable environment for the date, as being late often causes stress and anxiety for both parties. In answer A: put on her clothes, it can be considered as part of the process of getting ready but doesn't necessarily answer the question as well as answer C. Everyone puts on clothes to go out, it's a basic necessity, and does not directly address the reason behind Taylor's actions to be on time specifically.

They form from haploid spores. They have male and/or female reproductive organs and reproduce sexually. They produce haploid gametes by mitosis. Fertilization of gametes produces diploid zygotes. Zygotes develop into the diploid generation. Q: How do gametophyte plants form haploid gametes? A: Pick your answer from: 1). during omniosis. 2). during after mitosis. 3). during after omniosis. 4). through mitosis. Answer:","completion":"Gametophyte plants form haploid gametes through mitosis. This is option 4 in the given choices. To provide more context and understanding, let's delve deeper into the process. Gametophytes are the haploid generation of plants in their life cycle, and they produce gametes, which are necessary for sexual reproduction. These haploid gametes come from the haploid cells of the gametophyte plant. Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells, both having the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. In the case of gametophyte plants, since they are already haploid, mitosis allows them to produce haploid gametes with the same number of chromosomes as the parent gametophyte. This is different from meiosis, which occurs in the diploid generation where the cell divisions result in the production of haploid cells with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. During the process of mitosis in gametophyte plants, the haploid cells go through the stages of prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, eventually resulting in the formation of two identical cells with the same number of chromosomes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they can be involved in the process of fertilization. When a female gamete (egg) and a male gamete (sperm) fuse, they form a diploid zygote, which then develops into the diploid generation of the plant life cycle. This alternation between the haploid and diploid generations is a crucial aspect of the life cycle of plants and ensures genetic diversity among offspring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I read this background article the other day: Higher pressures increase the solubility of gases. You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO 2 is dissolved in the liquid. After opening, the pressure decreases (to the ambient pressure), so the solubility of CO 2 drops, causing it to bubble out of solution. Because they are not compressible like gases, solid and liquid solutes do not have noticeable changes in solubility at different external pressures. I am facing a new situation today: Robin is an exterminator who is making new mixtures of chemicals to use for when he gets called to kill rats in his neighborhood. To make the mixtures, he has to dissolve nitrogen gas in containers of water. In one container, container A, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under high pressure. In the other container, container B, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under low pressure. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which container will have lower solubility of the nitrogen gas?","completion":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, the solubility of gases is directly related to the pressure applied on the gas. This principle is known as Henry's Law, which states that the concentration of a dissolved gas in a liquid (solubility) is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas in equilibrium with the liquid. In your new situation with Robin, the exterminator, he is dissolving nitrogen gas in two containers of water: container A with high pressure, and container B with low pressure. According to Henry's Law and the information from the article, the solubility of the nitrogen gas will be higher in a container with higher pressure and lower in a container with lower pressure. Therefore, the correct answer to your question is that container B will have a lower solubility of the nitrogen gas compared to container A, due to the lower pressure applied in container B. This means that a smaller amount of nitrogen gas will dissolve in the water of container B than in container A, where the high pressure causes a greater amount of nitrogen gas to dissolve in the water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only \\"curiosities\\"? ? On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820. Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \\"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings \\"please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.\\"Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788–1857). Dahl was close to Friedrich during the artist's final years, and he expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures...

Write an article with the title: \\"In 2010 NCAA tournament loss to Ohio, Georgetown struggles to determine why it went wrong\\" Article:","completion":"Title: In 2010 NCAA Tournament Loss to Ohio, Georgetown Struggles to Determine Why It Went Wrong Introduction: The 2010 NCAA Tournament started with hope and high expectations for the Georgetown Hoyas as they secured the third seed and a chance to prove their mettle on college basketball's biggest stage. However, those dreams quickly vanished as they fell victim to a shocking upset loss at the hands of the 14th-seeded Ohio University Bobcats. With the dust finally settled, Georgetown's failure to advance remains one of the biggest surprises in the tournament's history. As the team analyzes the factors behind the defeat, it becomes imperative to consider key elements contributing to the Hoya's unceremonious exit from the competition. Georgetown's Offensive Struggles: From the opening tip-off, Georgetown's offense seemed off the mark. The usually-reliable scoring machine struggled to make shots against a determined Ohio defense that had its sights set on a monumental upset. The Hoyas shot just 38.2% from the field, a far cry from their regular-season average of 49.0%. Seeking a spark, Georgetown’s coaching staff may have concentrated too much on offensive plays, causing the team to lose focus and ultimately fail to shift the momentum in their favor. By neglecting the other crucial aspects of the game, the Hoyas upset their own balance and fostered a disjointed performance that left the door open for Ohio to strike. Ohio University's Superb Performance: While attention naturally gravitates toward Georgetown's underwhelming display, it is essential to recognize Ohio University's exceptional effort in pulling off the upset. Led by their star player Armon Bassett, the Bobcats were fearless and took full advantage of the Hoyas' lackluster performance. Bassett contributed 32 points, scoring more than any other individual that night. The Bobcats were also highly efficient from beyond the arc, connecting on 13 of 23 three-point attempts. This offensive showcase, combined with solid defensive play, made it extremely difficult for the Hoyas to regain control of the game. In addition, Ohio's fast-paced tempo seemed to wear down and frustrate Georgetown, further contributing to their demise. Defensive Lapses: Georgetown's usually formidable defense also appeared to falter in this critical matchup. Accustomed to contesting shots and stifling opponents, the Hoyas allowed the Bobcats to shoot 58.2% from the field, with Ohio's dynamic backcourt duo of Bassett and D.J. Cooper taking full advantage. Georgetown’s defenders seemed unable to adapt to Ohio's relentless offensive pressure, leaving them unable to force turnovers and transition effectively. Many have attributed the defensive breakdown to a lack of focus, communication, and determination within the team, resulting in an inability to properly execute the game plan. Mental Preparation and Complacency: As a higher-seeded team facing a seemingly lesser opponent, Georgetown may have entered the matchup with an air of complacency, underestimating the resolve of the Ohio University Bobcats. This lack of urgency undoubtedly affected the overall focus, teamwork, and mindset of the Hoyas, who appeared put off by the ferocity and tenacity of their opponents. The mental and emotional aspects of the game should not be discounted, as they often play a significant role in separating winners from losers, particularly in high-stakes single-elimination tournaments such as the NCAA. Conclusion: Georgetown's disappointing exit at the hands of Ohio University in the 2010 NCAA Tournament serves as a poignant reminder that no team can ever be taken for granted, regardless of rankings or reputations. Despite the setback, the Hoyas have an opportunity to learn from this experience, emphasizing the importance of consistent focus, preparation, and execution. By addressing these critical factors, Georgetown can strengthen its program to avoid similar pitfalls in the future. On the other hand, Ohio's victory will forever be remembered as a shining example of the unpredictability and excitement that makes the NCAA Tournament one of the most captivating spectacles in sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, a recent Eater article entitled \\"Three Charts That Show Why Culinary School Is Not Worth It\\" documents exactly that, showing how culinary school costs are on par with tuition at pricey four-year private colleges, as well as how getting a culinary arts degree doesn't really lead to a much higher salary than if a chef started out in a restaurant after high school. Eateries are getting creative in efforts to attract up-and-coming chefs by paying part of their workers' student loans every month, offering stock ownership, and paying more, per Fortune. (Restaurant reservations are also falling by the wayside.) Expand this summary.","completion":"The restaurant industry is facing a shortage of chefs as the economy revitalizes and more eateries continue opening. Restaurateurs report difficulty in finding enough qualified kitchen staff to meet the demand. A few years ago, a single job opening could attract numerous applications allowing restaurant owners to select the best candidate easily. However, the situation has reversed, with one cook now being sought after by several restaurants. There are multiple factors contributing to this shortage. The increase in the number of restaurants opening up due to the economic recovery is one reason. Another reason is the rise of \\"entitled millennials\\", with young chefs eager to open their own establishments rather than working in an existing kitchen. The popularity of television cooking shows has also influenced this mindset, creating a perception that owning a restaurant or being a celebrity chef is more glamorous and easier to achieve than in reality. Culinary school graduates often leave their education with significant debt and face low starting salaries in the restaurant industry. This leads many culinary professionals to turn towards resorts, chains, and other establishments that can offer higher salaries and better employee benefits. A recent article by Eater highlights that culinary school costs are similar to tuition fees at expensive four-year private colleges. Additionally, obtaining a culinary arts degree doesn't necessarily lead to a significantly higher salary compared to starting in a restaurant directly after high school. To attract and retain talented chefs, restaurants are implementing creative strategies. Some are offering to pay part of their employees' student loan debts every month, while others offer stock ownership or higher salaries. It's crucial for the restaurant industry to address this issue, as talented chefs are essential for maintaining the high quality and innovation that customers expect from their dining experiences. Lastly, the decline in restaurant reservations is also posing challenges for eateries, emphasizing the need for adaptable business models and a strong, reliable workforce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Information: - Advocacy is an activity by an individual or group which aims to influence decisions within political, economic, and social systems and institutions. Advocacy can include many activities that a person or organization undertakes including media campaigns, public speaking, commissioning and publishing research or conducting exit poll or the filing of an amicus brief. Lobbying (often by lobby groups) is a form of advocacy where a direct approach is made to legislators on an issue which plays a significant role in modern politics. Research has started to address how advocacy groups in the United States and Canada are using social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action. - A barrister (also known as barrister-at-law or bar-at-law) is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions who works at higher levels of court. Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation. Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Often, barristers are also recognised as \\"legal scholars\\". - A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court. - Richard Pepper Arden , 1st Baron Alvanley PC KC ( 20 May 1744 -- 19 March 1804 ) was a British barrister and Whig politician , who served as the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas . He was a Member of Parliament from 1783 to 1801 . - Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by judges, courts, and similar tribunals, stated in decisions that nominally decide individual cases but that in addition have precedential effect on future cases. Common law is a third branch of law, in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as \\"stare decisis\\"). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \\"matter of first impression\\"), judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision). Resolution of the issue in one case becomes precedent that binds future courts. \\"Stare decisis\\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems. - A tribunal, generally, is any person or institution with authority to judge, adjudicate on, or determine claims or disputeswhether or not it is called a tribunal in its title. For example, an advocate who appears before a court with a single judge could describe that judge as 'their tribunal'. Many governmental bodies that are titled 'tribunals' are so described to emphasize that they are not courts of normal jurisdiction. For example, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is a body specially constituted under international law; in Great Britain, employment tribunals are bodies set up to hear specific employment disputes. Private judicial bodies are also often styled 'tribunals'. The word \\"tribunal\\" is not conclusive of a body's function. For example, in Great Britain, the Employment Appeal Tribunal is a superior court of record. 'richard arden' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?

If \\"Clown who is looking very sad.\\", does this mean that \\"The clown is looking very happy.\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"Clown who is looking very sad\\" does not imply that \\"The clown is looking very happy.\\" In fact, these two statements have opposite meanings. Let's delve deeper into the meanings and implications the two statements carry. 1. \\"Clown who is looking very sad\\": This statement conveys that the clown in question is displaying a sad or unhappy expression. This could be due to various reasons, such as some unfortunate event in the clown's life, emotional distress, or even an act that aims to express sadness as a part of their performance. It is important to note that despite being a figure of entertainment and a performer meant to evoke laughter and amusement, clowns can also undergo difficult moments and portray emotions beyond happiness or joy. 2. \\"The clown is looking very happy\\": This statement suggests that the clown has a happy or cheerful expression. Typically, we associate clowns with happiness, laughter, and merriment. This statement confirms this association, as it implies that the clown is content or enthusiastic, possibly as a part of their performance or due to their personality. These two statements are contrasting in nature, as they depict opposite emotions experienced or displayed by the clown. The first statement focuses on sadness and a departure from the stereotypes associated with clowns, while the second statement reflects the lively and light-hearted aspects we often expect from clowns. Without any additional context or information, it is impossible to confirm that a sad clown would suddenly appear happy or vice versa. It is important to remember that emotions and expressions can be dynamic and change over time, but one statement does not inherently imply the opposite."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"A corporation balance, usually referred to as a balance sheet, is a financial statement that presents a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It gives an overview of the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. The balance sheet follows the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity. This equation helps to provide a comprehensive understanding of a corporation's financial health. The statement you provided, \\"A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand,\\" is not a suitable answer for corporation balance. This statement describes a simplified method for measuring profits in a cash-based business and does not account for various other factors that contribute to a company's overall financial health. A balance sheet, on the other hand, is more comprehensive and provides a more accurate representation of a corporation's financial position: 1. Assets: These are resources owned by the company that have future economic value. Assets can be divided into current assets (cash, accounts receivable, inventory, etc.) and non-current assets (property, equipment, intangible assets, etc.). 2. Liabilities: These are the obligations or debts a company has to pay to external parties. Liabilities can be classified as current liabilities (accounts payable, short-term debt, etc.) and non-current liabilities (long-term debt, deferred tax liabilities, etc.). 3. Shareholders' Equity: This represents the residual interest in a company's assets after deducting its liabilities. It consists of invested capital (share capital, additional paid-in capital) and retained earnings (accumulated profits not distributed as dividends). A corporation's balance sheet gives a more thorough understanding of its financial health, as it accounts for all assets, liabilities, and equity, rather than just considering cash balances to measure profits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Blood vessels blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to this? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: CHAPTER REVIEW 20.1 Structure and Function of Blood Vessels Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to the heart. Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller vessels, forming arterioles. Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body tissues. Capillaries lead back to small vessels known as venules that flow into the larger veins and eventually back to the heart. The arterial system is a relatively high-pressure system, so arteries have thick walls that appear round in cross section. The venous system is a lower-pressure system, containing veins that have larger lumens and thinner walls. They often appear flattened. Arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins are composed of three tunics known as the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa. Capillaries have only a tunica intima layer. The tunica intima is a thin layer composed of a simple squamous epithelium known as endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue. The tunica media is a thicker area composed of variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue. It is the thickest layer in all but the largest arteries. The tunica externa is primarily a layer of connective tissue, although in veins, it also contains some smooth muscle. Blood flow through vessels can be dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and vasodilation in their walls.

Enter the Shoguns: Japan's austere, ruthless, but statesmanlike new ruler, Yoritomo Minamoto, set up his government in Kamakura (just south of modern Tokyo), well away from the \\"softening\\" influence of court life that had been the undoing of his predecessor, Kiyomori. First of the national rulers to take the title of sei-i tai-shogun (\\"barbarian-subduing great general\\"), Minamoto expanded and consolidated his power by confiscating lands from some of the defeated Taira and redistributing them to his samurai vassals. Minamoto died in 1199, and the feudal structure passed intact to the tutelage of his widow's family, the Hojo, who were content to play regent to a figurehead shogun, in much the same way as the Fujiwara had done with the emperor. The fiction of Japanese imperial power had become infinitely extendable. The emperor at Kyoto — still seconded by a Fujiwara regent at court — legitimized a Minamoto who was himself a military dictator controlled by a Hojo regent. In a country where form and substance were inextricably interrelated, two things counted in politics: symbolic authority and real power. Neither could exist without the other. A thwarted Mongol invasion in 1274 weakened the Kamakura regime. The fighting brought none of the usual spoils of war that provincial warlords and samurai had come to expect as payment. And the treasury was empty after earthquake, famine, and plague had crippled the economy. Buddhist monasteries were using their private armies to support imperial ambitions to bring power back to Kyoto. Worst of all, the Kamakura warriors, resenting the way the Kyoto court referred to them as \\"Eastern barbarians,\\" sought refinement in a ruinous taste for luxury: extravagant feasts, rich costumes, and opulent homes. Kamakura was falling apart.

Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses. Each form of life is linked to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger. Options: A Animals. B Plants. C Animals and plants. D All living things. Answer: B Plants. Question: A:","completion":"Which organisms are capable of directly using sunlight to produce food, providing energy for other living things in a food chain? A. Animals B. Plants C. Animals and plants D. All living things Answer: B. Plants"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Question: Process: - A forest fire starts - The fire surrounds the vicinity - The animals are trapped - Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - The survivors must find a new habitat - Conflict with other animals occur. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Less animals would die in the fire happens, how will it affect a SMALLER negative effect on animals. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would definitely have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. Step 1: Analyze the perturbation. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that fewer animals would die in the fire. Step 2: Determine the direct effects. Fewer animal deaths in the fire means more animals surviving the immediate disaster. Step 3: Assess the subsequent actions. If more animals survive the fire, more would have their habitats destroyed and hence would need to find new habitats. Step 4: Determine potential conflicts due to increased survivors. The increase in animals seeking new habitats would likely lead to more competition (for resources) and conflict among animals. Step 5: Consider indirect effects. A less obvious consequence could be the effect on the balance of predator and prey populations, which could have far-reaching consequences for the food chain and the broader ecosystem. Step 6: Abstracting away the consequences. While it initially seems to have a positive effect in terms of fewer immediate animal deaths, in the longer term, it could still lead to substantial individual animal suffering and potential imbalances in the local ecosystem. In conclusion, the assumption that fewer animals would die in the fire indeed has a direct effect on number of survivors who have to deal with their destroyed habitat and indirectly influences the post-fire ecosystem balance potentially negatively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context_2 : Vance Gibson (born July 19, 1953) was the 18th head football coach for the Howard Payne University Yellow Jackets located in Brownwood, Texas and he held that position for thirteen seasons, from 1992 until 2004. His career coaching record at Howard Payne was 89–42. Context_3 : General Sir Jack Wentworth Harman, {'1': \\", '2': \\", '3': \\", '4': \\"} (20 July 1920 – 28 December 2009) was Adjutant-General to the Forces. He began his military career in 1940, serving in The Queen's Bays for the majority of his early career and saw service with them during Second World War in the Middle East, Europe and Africa. Following the war Harman held various appointments at regimental, divisional and corps level rising to fulfil the role of Adjutant-General to the Forces in 1976. His final position was as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, which he held until retirement in 1981. In later life he served as a director of an insurance brokers and vice-chairman of the National Army Museum and The Automobile Association before he died in December 2009, at the age of 89. Context_4 : John Albert Long (born 1957) is an Australian paleontologist who is currently Strategic Professor in Palaeontology at Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia. He was previously the Vice President of Research and Collections at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. He is also an author of popular science books. His main area of research is on the fossil fish of the Late Devonian Gogo Formation from northern Western Australia. It has yielded many important insights into fish evolution, such as Gogonasus and Materpiscis, the later specimen being crucial to our understanding of the origins of vertebrate reproduction. His love of fossil collecting began at age 7 and he graduated with PhD from Monash University in 1984, specialising in Palaeozoic fish evolution. He held postdoctoral positions at the Australian National University (1984–85, Rothmans Fellow), The University of Western Australia (1986–87, Queen Elizabeth II Award) and The University of Tasmania (1988–89, ARC Fellow) before taking up a position as Curator in Vertebrate Palaeontology at the Western Australian Museum (1989–2004), and then as Head of Sciences at Museum Victoria (2004–2009). Context_5 : The Queen's Remembrancer (or King's Remembrancer) is an ancient judicial post in the legal system of England and Wales. Since the Lord Chancellor no longer sits as a judge, the Remembrancer is the oldest judicial position in continual existence. The post was created in 1154 by King Henry II as the chief official in the Exchequer Court, whose purpose was 'to put the Lord Treasurer and the Barons of Court in remembrance of such things as were to be called upon and dealt with for the benefit of the Crown', a primary duty being to keep records of the taxes, paid and unpaid. The first King's Remembrancer was Richard of Ilchester, a senior servant of the Crown and later Bishop of Winchester. The King's Remembrancer continued to sit in the Court of the Exchequer until its abolition in 1882. The post of Queen's Remembrancer is held by the Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court. Context_6 : \\"Love Under New Management\\" is the second single released from the 1989 self-titled album by American R&B singer Miki Howard. The song reached its peak of No. 2 on Billboard's Hot R&B Singles chart on March 24, 1990. The song held that position for two weeks (kept out of the top spot by \\"All Around the World\\" by Lisa Stansfield) and propelled the album to No. 4 on the Top R&B Albums chart, Howard's highest charting album. The song reached #89 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Context_7 : Khaled Efendi al-Atassi al-Husseini (1837 – October, 1908) (Arabic: خالد الأتاسي‎ ‎ ) was a famous Syrian religious authority, scholar and poet. Born in Homs to the famous Atassi family in 1837, he went through the traditional preparation for the position of Mufti, a post his family filled for over 400 years. His father, Mohammad Efendi Al-Atassi was the Grand Mufti of Homs, and so was his uncle, Saeed Al-Atassi. Khaled Efendi studied under famous Islamic scholars of his time in Homs and Damascus. In 1876 he was elected as deputy of Homs and Hama to the parliament of the Ottoman Empire. He was also given the post of Mudarres (teacher) in the Mosuqe of Khaled ibn Al-Waleed in Homs, a post that was held by his family for generations. In 1861, and while his father was still alive, Khaled Efendi assumed the position of the Mufti. However, Islamic court registers of Homs later designate him as the Deputy-Mufti, and his father as the Mufti. In 1882 the Mufti of Homs, Mohammad Al-Atassi died, but the Ottoman administration handed the Mufti position to sheikh Hafez Al-Jindi Al-Abassi, who served as a Mufti till 1885. Khaled Efendi became the Mufti of Homs in 1885 by an official decree, and was removed from his post in 1894, to be filled by his brother, Abdu-Lateef Al-Atassi. Context_8 : George Lidster is the former head men's soccer coach at George Washington University. He held that position from 1987–1996 and 1998–2011, and posted a 188-175-49 record in 22 seasons, making him the all-time winningest coach in school history. Additionally he has compiled an 89-75-23 record in Atlantic 10 conference play, and has won 2 Atlantic 10 tournament titles, and made 3 NCAA tournament appearances. Context_9 : Osbert fitzHervey (died 1206) was an Anglo-Norman royal judge. Brother of Hubert Walter and Theobald Walter, Osbert served three kings of England and may have contributed to the legal treatise attributed to his uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. Ralph of Coggeshall, a medieval writer, praised Osbert's knowledge of law, but condemned his acceptance of gifts from plaintiffs and defendants in legal cases. Osbert was one of a group of men who are considered the first signs of a professional judiciary in England. Context_10 : Osbert († 1231) was an early 13th-century cleric who held the position of Bishop of Dunblane (Scotland). A mandate for a new election was issued in January 1226 after the presumed resignation of Osbert's predecessor Radulf. Osbert's name (as \\"O.\\") appears in the cartulary of Cambuskenneth Abbey, dating 1227 x 1231, where he is called \\"Bishop of Strathearn\\". An unnamed bishop of Dunblane occurs in the \\"Dunfermline Registrum\\", dating to April 1227, and this was certainly Osbert. He also appears in attendance at a council held in Dundee in 1230. He had become an Augustinian canon at Holyrood Abbey by the time of his recorded death in 1231. fact_1 : Osbert fitzHervey (died 1206) was an Anglo-Norman royal judge. fact_2 : Brother of Hubert Walter and Theobald Walter, Osbert served three kings of England and may have contributed to the legal treatise attributed to his uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. fact_3 : Ranulf de Glanvill (\\"alias\\" Glanvil, Glanville, Granville, etc., died 1190) was Chief Justiciar of England during the reign of King Henry II (1154–89) and was the probable author of \\"Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Anglie\\" (\\"The Treatise on the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom of England\\"), the earliest treatise on the laws of England.

He noticed that patient A's blood vessels are constricted, but blood vessels of patient B are dilated. He needs to prescribe medicine according to his observation. Would patient B's blood vessels be narrower or wider than patient A's? Hint: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels.

Fact 2: Sound Sound waves are mechanical waves. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What can vibrating matter cause?\\" with the following options: - electromagnetic energy - Relieve pain - nothing - loss of matter - destruction of matter - mechanical waves - Electrical energy - kinetic energy The answer is:","completion":"Given the two facts provided - Fact 1: Matter vibrating can cause sound, and Fact 2: Sound waves are mechanical waves - we can deduce that vibrating matter can cause mechanical waves. When matter vibrates, it produces sound waves by compressing and expanding the surrounding particles or molecules. These waves propagate through the medium in which the vibrations occur, such as air, water, or solid materials. Sound waves are a type of mechanical wave, as they require a medium to travel and involve the transfer of energy from one particle to the next via vibrations and collisions. Mechanical waves, such as sound waves, differ from electromagnetic waves because they require a medium to travel, while electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum. Both, however, involve the transfer of energy from one point to another. Regarding the other options: - Electromagnetic energy: Vibrating matter does not directly cause electromagnetic energy. Electromagnetic waves are created by oscillating electric and magnetic fields and can travel through a vacuum, unlike mechanical waves. - Relieve pain: Vibrating matter does not inherently relieve pain. However, applications of vibration therapy in medicine may help alleviate pain by stimulating nerve receptors and relaxing muscles. - Nothing: Vibrating matter can indeed produce sound waves, which are mechanical waves, so this option is incorrect. - Loss of matter: Vibrating matter does not typically result in the loss of matter. However, in specific, extreme circumstances (e.g., with high-energy vibrations), some matter might be dislodged or eroded. - Destruction of matter: Vibrating matter does not generally cause the destruction of matter, although specific instances may involve localized destruction, such as in the case of ultrasonic cavitation. - Electrical energy: Vibrating matter does not directly cause electrical energy, though certain materials can generate electrical charges due to vibrations or mechanical stress, a phenomenon known as piezoelectricity. - Kinetic energy: Although vibrating matter does involve kinetic energy, as particles in motion possess kinetic energy, the answer \\"mechanical waves\\" is more precise and accurate in this context, as it directly refers to the phenomenon caused by vibrating matter. In conclusion, based on the two facts presented, the answer is that vibrating matter can cause mechanical waves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the words from this verse are properly spaced, here's how it should look: \\"The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.\\" Now let's break it down into smaller sections for a clearer understanding: 1. \\"The word that the LORD spake\\" - This phrase indicates that the message is a divine revelation or a command that came directly from God (referred to here as \\"the LORD\\"). 2. \\"to Jeremiah the prophet\\" - This tells the reader who received the message from God. In this case, it's Jeremiah, who was a prophet. A prophet is a person regarded as an inspired teacher or proclaimer of the will of God. 3. \\"how Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon\\" - This part of the sentence introduces Nebuchadnezzar who was the king of Babylon. It presents him as the subject of the divine message or plan. 4. \\"should come and smite the land of Egypt.\\" - This is the core message transmitted to Jeremiah. The phrase suggests that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon would invade and conquer (\\"come and smite\\") the land of Egypt, according to God's plan or prediction. Overall, this verse appears to reflect a prophetic message from God, transmitted through Jeremiah, about a future event involving King Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Knowing this was the only way out, I obeyed and diligently signed all the papers. I hated my parents but still felt the inescapable drive to prove to them that I was worth something. I had to show them I wasn't crazy. As the hours passed, I was shown to a blank room with plastic sheets and plastic pillows, which caused me to wonder what kind of distant confused souls had been imprisoned in this sterile place. There were bars on the windows and the only door out of the unit was locked 24/7. I knew my only refuge for the time being would be through the hour a day art therapy class and the smoke breaks I could take at will. They had given me a legal pad after my parents had told them of my affinity for writing. With it I set to work on the flow of words and the river of thoughts, both dark and hopeful that careened through my tired mind. Instead of sleep, I would write. I expressed my vicious frustration for the place and thought constantly of the passing hours, counting them down as they went. Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids. There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad. I had the suspicion that the attendants would come in and read my thoughts as I was eating meals or watching TV and I wondered if this was hindering my ability to get out. I wondered what kind of opinions and judgments they were forming about me. I had bared my soul on those pages explaining desperately how the thoughts would not leave even in this place, where it mattered most that they were gone. The fuckers would never leave. Maybe I was crazy.

We already know that National Security Agency can dip into your Facebook page and Google searches. And it seems that almost every store we go into these days wants your home phone number and ZIP code as part of any deal. So when Edward Snowden -- now cooling his heels in Russia -- revealed the extent to which the NSA is spying on Americans, collecting data on phone calls we make, it's not as if we should have been surprised. We live in a world that George Orwell predicted in 1984. And that realization has caused sales of the 1949, dystopian novel to spike dramatically upward recently -- a 9,000% increase at one point on Amazon. com. Comparisons between Orwell's novel about a tightly controlled totalitarian future ruled by the everywhere-present Big Brother and today are, in fact, quite similar. Here are a few of the most obvious ones. Telescreens -- in the novel, nearly all public and private places have large TV screens that broadcast government propaganda , news and approved entertainment. But they are also two-way monitors that spy on citizens, private lives. Today websites like Facebook track our likes and dislikes, and governments and private individuals hack into our computers and find out what they want to know. Then there are the ever-present monitoring cameras that spy on the ordinary people as they go about their daily routine.

Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Jesse?\\", is \\"hygenic\\" a valid answer? Options: [1]. Yes; [2]. No; Answer:","completion":"Answer: [1]. Yes Jesse's decision to take a bath right after getting home can be seen as an indication of being hygienic. Hygiene refers to the set of practices and habits that help maintain good health and prevent the spread of diseases by keeping oneself and one's surroundings clean. In this context, taking a bath after being outdoors or upon returning home is generally considered a hygienic practice. Therefore, describing Jesse as \\"hygienic\\" would be a valid answer. Being hygienic involves various personal habits and practices, such as regular bathing, washing hands frequently and thoroughly, brushing teeth, and keeping living spaces clean and organized. These habits help in reducing the risk of infections and other illnesses caused by germs, bacteria, and viruses. The fact that Jesse takes a bath right after getting home may not provide a complete understanding of all his personal habits; however, it does provide some insight into his adherence to hygienic practices. Moreover, taking a bath after returning home could mean that Jesse is also aware of the importance of cleanliness for his overall well-being. He may have been exposed to dirt, sweat, or other contaminants throughout the day, and by showering or bathing after coming home, he is making efforts to remove these impurities from his body. By doing so, he demonstrates a proactive approach towards his personal hygiene and cleanliness. Therefore, it is fair to consider \\"hygienic\\" a valid way to describe Jesse based on the information provided about him taking a bath after getting home. However, in a broader context, it would be beneficial to know more about Jesse's overall habits and practices to gain a more comprehensive understanding of his hygiene habits as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: To allow for agricultural development of the Great Plains and house a growing population, the US passed the Homestead Acts of 1862: it allowed a settler to claim up to 160 acres (65 ha) of land, provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it. The provisions were expanded under the Kinkaid Act of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire section. Hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building sod houses out of the very turf of their land. Many of them were not skilled dryland farmers and failures were frequent. Much of the Plains were settled during relatively wet years. Government experts did not understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice counter to what would have worked[citation needed].

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Bobby and Will were two friends attending a genetics course. Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species. and a hint : Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer provided does not accurately address the question about who built the San Juan Capistrano Mission. The mission was founded by Father Junípero Serra, a Spanish Franciscan friar, on November 1, 1776, in what is now the city of San Juan Capistrano, California. It was part of a larger endeavor led by the Spanish colonizers to establish a series of religious and military outposts known as the California Missions along the coast of what is now the state of California. The primary purpose of the California Missions, including the San Juan Capistrano Mission, was to convert the Native American populations to Christianity and assimilate them into the Spanish colonial society. In terms of construction, the mission buildings were primarily built by Native American laborers under the supervision of Spanish padres and soldiers. The mission complex included a church, living quarters for the padres and Native American converts, granaries, workshops, and other facilities necessary for supporting a flourishing settlement. The original stone church at the San Juan Capistrano Mission was built between 1797 and 1806, featuring a large bell tower and a grand interior. Unfortunately, a massive earthquake in 1812 destroyed much of the church and led to the death of more than 40 Native American worshippers who were attending a service at the time. In conclusion, the San Juan Capistrano Mission was founded by Father Junípero Serra and the Spanish colonizers, and primarily built by local Native American laborers under the direction of the Spanish padres and soldiers. The success of the settlement is part of its history, but it does not specifically address the question of who built the mission."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

With regular starting quarterback Tarvaris Jackson recovering from injuries, Kelly Holcomb started in his place. In the first quarter, the Vikings trailed early as Brett Favre threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings, surpassing Dan Marino with the 421st touchdown pass of his career. After Favre was honored for his accomplishment, Minnesota narrowed the margin between the two teams to a single point with field goals of 44 and 35 yards from kicker Ryan Longwell, before Mason Crosby hit a 28-yard field goal to restore a four-point lead for the Packers going into halftime. In the third quarter, Crosby and Longwell cancelled each other out with field goals from 44 yards and 48 yards, respectively. In the fourth quarter, Crosby made a 33-yard field goal, before Favre completed a 33-yard touchdown pass to James Jones. Minnesota tried to rebound with Holcomb completing a 15-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Sidney Rice. The Vikings failed with an attempted onside kick, but two plays later Chad Greenway recovered a fumble by Favre, giving the Vikings just under 2 minutes to go 54 yards for a game-tying touchdown.

Cross-Eyed Opossum a Star in Germany BERLIN – Heidi, the cross-eyed opossum, is the latest creature to rocket from Germany's front pages to international recognition, capturing the world's imagination with her bright, black eyes turned toward her pointed pink nose. Since the first photos were published in December, the marsupial from Leipzig Zoo has attracted more Facebook fans than Chancellor Angela Merkel. By Wednesday more than 111,000 fans from as far away as Bangkok and Montreal and clear across Europe were exclaiming \\"so cute!!\\" and \\"so sweet.\\" Experts say that like Knut, Berlin's famous fluffy white polar cub who was abandoned by his mother, and Paul, the late octopus who correctly predicted the outcome of all of Germany's 2010 World Cup games and Spain's victory in the final, the hype surrounding Heidi is fed by a human weakness for cuddly looking critters and the ability of modern mass media to spread images around the globe instantly. Bangkok resident Julie Queen-Vichitthanarurk said she heard about Heidi on the local radio station on the way to work, and raced home to find a picture on the Internet and become a \\"fan\\" on Facebook. \\"Right away when I saw her picture, I feel in love with her!\\" the 40-year-old told The Associated Press in an Facebook message. \\"There is just something so sweet about her that made my heart melt.\\" It is exactly that feeling that humans crave, making such \\"cute\\" animal images so popular. \\"It triggers a reaction in our unconsciousness, when we see these creatures that make us think of children,\\" said Peter Walschburger, a biological psychologist at Berlin's Free University. \\"Animals are so innocent -- in a way that we no longer are,\\" said media expert Steffen Damm. \\"They remind us of our lost connection to nature.\\" Leipzig Zoo insisted the \\"media resonance was surprising and not planned,\\" but it has nevertheless moved to protect the rights to her name and cross-eyed image -- believed to be the result of pressure on her eyes created by fatty deposits. The zoo says the squint doesn't hurt her. Heidi first attracted attention after a local TV report about her upcoming home -- a new nocturnal enclosure in the tropical environment -- featured her as one of several animals in quarantine until it opens July 1. She will share her enclosure with her sister Naira and their male companion, Teddy. All three arrived at Leipzig Zoo on May 5, 2010. \\"She definitively won't be Germany's next Super Opossum,\\" zookeeper Michael Eisner told MDR television, as Heidi squinted up at him from a cage for a documentary about the zoo in December. He couldn't have been more wrong. The clip attracted so much attention on the Internet, the station has developed 10 episodes featuring Heidi and a local stuffed animal manufacture, Koesen, has adapted its line of plush opossums to include a white one with black ears and, of course, crossed-eyes. While Leipzig Zoo says it is not actively engaging in marketing at this time, the attention will most certainly boost admittance, and thus revenue. The Berlin Zoo recorded a 27 percent jump in 2007, the first year of polar bear cub, Knut, whose image as a playful cotton-puff ball of bear fuzz captured hearts around the world. That included U.S. star photographer Annie Liebowitz, who snapped him for an environment issue of Vanity Fair. The attention brought nearly euro6.8 million (then 10.7 million) in revenue. Some animal rights activists, however, maintain the attention is a further form of abuse of animals that are already suffering from their captivity. \\"These animals are put on show for millions of people, but afterward they remain incurably crippled,\\" said Edmund Haferbeck, an animal expert with Germany's branch of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He said he could not name a case where animals benefited from the hype created by the media attention -- including Knut, whom he said still languishes in an enclosure much too small for him. \\"On the contrary, it is completely counterproductive,\\" Haferbeck said. \\"The money they generate is not put toward improving the zoo, but go into their (strapped) budgets.\\" Not every animal is able to generate such interest. Nuremberg zoo, in southern Germany sought to create attention similar to that generated by Knut when it found itself with a polar cub of its own, Flocke, born in December 2007. But she never really created hype. Nor did another polar cub, Willbaer, or an attempt by the Chemnitz Zoo during the 2006 World Cup to have its animals predict the outcome of games -- attributed to elements of timing, how an animal's particular story or affliction is able to hit the public's nerve at any given moment, a pattern known to humans for centuries. \\"It recalls ancient Rome, where exotic species were applauded in the Circus Maximus,\\" said Damm. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Heidi, the cross-eyed opossum from Leipzig Zoo in Germany, has become an international sensation, amassing a significant following on social media, outranking even Chancellor Angela Merkel in terms of Facebook fans. This phenomenon has been attributed to humans' fondness for adorable-looking animals and the efficiency of modern media in disseminating images globally. Zoos often benefit financially from the popularity of such animals, as seen with a significant rise in admissions and revenues at Berlin Zoo during the peak of Knut the polar bear's fame. However, some animal rights activists argue that such attention is detrimental to the animals and can result in neglect or improper care."},{"prompt":"Instructions: Given a comment text in Tamil, classify the comment into one of these categories (i) Hope speech, if it contains encouraging, positive or supportive contents about equality, diversity or inclusion, (ii) Not Hope Speech or (iii) Not in Expected Language, if the text is not Tamil.

Summarize this article: JOHANNESBURG — Former President Nelson Mandela, who has been hospitalized since Saturday, has had a recurrence of a lung infection and is responding to treatment, the office of South Africa’s current president, Jacob Zuma, announced Tuesday. It was the first indication of Mr. Mandela’s medical condition since he was flown to Pretoria and taken to a hospital for unspecified tests over the weekend. It is his second hospitalization this year; in February he was checked into a hospital for tests to address a chronic stomach complaint, the government said at the time. He was released after minor diagnostic surgery, officials said. Mr. Mandela, who is 94 and increasingly frail, was “receiving appropriate treatment and he is responding to the treatment,” according to Mr. Zuma’s office. The current stay in the hospital is the longest in recent memory, raising fears that Mr. Mandela’s condition is grave. Government officials have been upbeat about his prognosis while offering few details about his condition. Given his age, any infection is by its nature serious, medical experts say. Photo “I’m not sure we should press the panic button every single time a man of his age has the sniffles,” Mark Sonderup, vice chairman at the South African Medical Association, told The Mail and Guardian, a weekly newspaper, this week. “But unfortunately,” he added, “we have to accept that simple health matters for a person of that age can turn very serious, very quickly.” Mr. Mandela, South Africa’s first black president, has had respiratory ailments for years, in part owing to the 27 years he spent in prison, most of it on Robben Island, working in a bleak quarry. He was given a diagnosis of tuberculosis in 1988 and had fluid drained from his lungs. Mr. Mandela retired from public life some years ago, and he was last seen publicly at the celebrations for the World Cup soccer tournament, which South Africa hosted in 2010, although he receives frequent visits from old friends and visiting dignitaries. In January 2011, he was hospitalized for an acute respiratory infection, and the news of that illness set off a panic about his health. When Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited South Africa in August, she stopped by Mr. Mandela’s home in the rural village of Qunu to see him. In a photograph of the two of them, Mr. Mandela beamed his trademark grin, but looked frail seated in an armchair and dressed in a gray cardigan. Mr. Mandela led the African National Congress to a resounding victory in the first fully democratic elections in South Africa’s history in 1994, after negotiating a peaceful transition from white rule. Despite harsh treatments at the hands of the apartheid government, Mr. Mandela advocated forgiveness and reconciliation, making him an icon of peacemaking the world over. After a single term as president, Mr. Mandela retired from politics in 1999. ||||| Frail Nelson Mandela's 'sparkle fading': wife (AFP) – Dec 11, 2012 JOHANNESBURG — Ailing anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was Tuesday spending a fourth day in hospital for more tests, as his wife said his trademark \\"sparkle\\" was waning. Looking calm in an interview with a local television network, Graca Machel did not give details about Mandela's health status, just saying it was painful to see the nonagenarian \\"aging\\". \\"I mean, this spirit and this sparkle, you see that somehow it's fading,\\" she told ENews Central Africa (ENCA) on Monday in her first interview since Mandela was hospitalised at the weekend. South African government officials have said the former president is comfortable and does not face immediate danger, but they refuse to speculate on when he is likely to be discharged from a Pretoria military hospital. Mandela, 94, was at the weekend admitted to hospital for tests that authorities say are expected of people of his age. \\"To see him aging, it's something also which pains you. . . . You understand and you know it has to happen,\\" said Graca. Mandela's grand-daughter Ndileka told the same TV network that he has taken to accept his condition. \\"I think he takes it in his strides, he has come to accept that it's part of growing old, and it's part of humanity as such. At some point you will dependent on someone else, he has come to embrace it,\\" she said. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula visited Mandela on Monday and said the revered statesman was \\"doing very, very well\\". The presidency said it was too early to give an update as they have to hear first from the doctors. Copyright © 2013 AFP. All rights reserved.

This was Mandela's second hospitalization in the year, with the previous incident involving tests related to a chronic stomach complaint. The announcement from the office of President Jacob Zuma stated that Mandela was receiving appropriate treatment and was responding well. Mandela, who was 94 at the time, had long battled respiratory ailments, partly due to the 27 years he spent in prison. Apart from his pivotal role in leading a peaceful transition from white rule in South Africa, Mandela was known for advocating forgiveness and reconciliation, which made him a global icon of peacemaking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Oil Train Derailment in Quebec: Death Toll Rises to 13, with Investigation Underway The death toll in the tragic oil train derailment that took place in Quebec has risen to 13 as authorities discovered eight more bodies amongst the wreckage, Associated Press reports. Alongside the terrible loss of life, numerous people remain unaccounted for, with the AP estimating approximately 40 individuals, and Reuters suggesting an updated figure closer to 50. The disaster has had a profound impact on the community, with a need for supportive actions to help identify victims and establish the cause of the accident. Forensic teams are now closely examining the bodies discovered thus far, with the coroner requesting DNA samples from the families of those still missing. This critical information will aid authorities in the identification process, providing much-needed closure for grief-stricken families in the Lac-Megantic area. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the town of Lac-Megantic recently, expressing shock at the devastation caused by the derailment. The aftermath led him to describe the scene as a \\"war zone.\\" Upon witnessing the disaster, Harper pledged a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the accident and ensure that those responsible are held accountable, the BBC reports. According to official statements, the derailment led to the destruction of around 30 buildings in the town of Lac-Megantic. The extent of the damage has significantly impacted locals, with many beginning to question the safety of oil train transportation. As such, the investigation launched by Canadian authorities will hopefully offer some insight into the accident's causes and potential preventative measures. As the small community of Lac-Megantic grapples with the unfathomable loss in the wake of the oil train derailment, families and friends are left waiting for answers and facing the conclusive identification of victims. The incident raises questions about the safety of oil transportation by rail and the need for stricter regulations to prevent future accidents. The Canadian government, under the guidance of Prime Minister Harper, is now committed to uncovering the causes of the accident and seeking justice for those impacted by this profound tragedy. In conclusion, the Quebec oil train derailment has sent shockwaves through the small town of Lac-Megantic, with a rising death toll that now stands at 13 and the possibility of many more victims yet to be found. As families and friends of the missing anxiously await further information, Canadian authorities are working diligently to identify the victims and unearthing the cause of the disaster. The resulting investigation, described as rigorous by Prime Minister Harper, will hopefully ensure further safety measures are implemented to avoid such catastrophic events in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To get this effect, start by pouring some tonic water into a container where you can see it. You can add it by itself or dilute it with water. However, the more water you add, the dimmer it will glow. Tonic water is available at most local stores and supermarkets for just a few dollars. Be sure to get tonic water, not club soda or soda water. The bottle should say \\"with quinine\\" or something similar. All you need to do to get tonic water to glow bright is to illuminate it with a black light. Be sure to dim the lights in the room before you do this or it will be more difficult to see the glowing effect. Black lights are available from specialty party stores (like Spencer's, etc.) or online. The price for the black light often depends on its size and brightness — basic lights can cost as little as 20 or less. Making tonic water glow with a black light makes it look very strange, but it doesn't make it poisonous, radioactive, or harmful to drink in any other way. However, tonic water is often high in calories and sugar, so enjoy it sparingly. Tonic water glows this way because of tiny chemicals called \\"phosphors\\" inside the liquid. When ultraviolet light from the black light (which humans can't see) hits the phosphors, they convert it into a form that humans can see, producing the glow.","completion":"The article explains how to make tonic water glow under a black light by illuminating it with the light, and also mentions that it is safe to drink while highlighting the phosphors' role in producing the glow."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The vet will support the dog's back end and turn the back of the paw so that it rests on the ground. This is to check the dog is aware the paw is in the wrong position and correct it. Not to do so could indicate nerve damage. The vet will also check for other nerve reflexes, such as the ability to feel pain in the toes, as an indication of whether there is nerve damage or not. The vet will gently feel along the spine, being especially alert for local areas of tenderness and muscle \\"fasciculation,\\" which is where the muscles twitch because they are sensitized to pain. If back pain is confirmed, the vet may suggest imaging to check what is causing the pain. Sources of pain include disc disease, spinal arthritis, spondylitis (infection in the vertebra), inflammatory nerve disease, muscle sprains and strains. A diagnostic test commonly used at veterinary clinics is to take x-rays of the spine. Each section of the back is x-rayed in turn (depending on where the suspected damage is), such as the neck, chest, and lower back. Two views are usually taken of each area so as to provide a cross reference: One view taken from the side (the lateral) and one from above or below (the dorso-ventral or ventro-dorsal). Radiography can provide helpful information about the bones of the spine and the spaces between them, but it cannot provide a picture of the spinal cord itself. For this more advanced imaging methods are needed. A limitation of x-rays is they can be misleading. For example, a narrowed space between two vertebra is abnormal and suggest that the disc is diseased. However, the disc may have ruptured harmlessly to one side and avoided pressurizing the spinal cord. Thus, x-rays can give a clues, which can be interpreted in the light of clinical signs as giving a diagnosis. More sophisticated imaging techniques, where available, have taken over from x-rays. These sophisticated techniques can visualize the spinal cord itself. Thus if a disc has prolapsed into the spine, the clinician will be able to see the \\"waistline\\" in the spine where it is compressed. This is vital information if specialist decompression surgery is being considered, as it allows the surgeon to know exactly which discs are involved, so they operate in the correct place. Unfortunately, MRI and CT scans are costly. In addition, the dog also needs to be anesthetized so that it keeps still in the scanner. This will have an additional cost, as well as a further health risk for the dog.

The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its child protagonists, forest setting, and the discovery of a castle's ruins. Yet at its core, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. Opening with a dream sequence employing the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound, the film details his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who has pledged her love to him, and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The film's psychological complexities do give the film merit, yet there's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex. The film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill, and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy, children's choir-augmented soundtrack. With its odd dreamlike quality, the film is at best interesting, yet pales beside Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same era. Certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate, for unlike many banned films, Pasolini's 'Salo' or Larry Clark's 'Ken Park' for instance, the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release.

A flood occurs when a river overflows its banks. This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge. After reading the above, is \\"A flood plain area of land is good for growing crops\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What is the flood plain area of land good for if it floods often?\\"? Choices: (a). no; (b). yes;","completion":"(b). yes The statement \\"A flood plain area of land is good for growing crops\\" is indeed correct in reference to the passage provided. Floodplains are formed when a river frequently overflows its banks, creating a layer of rich soil as the floodwater recedes. This rich soil, enhanced by the sediment carried by the floodwater, creates an ideal environment for growing plants. The Nile River valley serves as an excellent example, where crops can be raised amidst a sandy desert due to the fertile soil left behind by the annual flooding of the Nile River. Furthermore, natural levees which form along the river banks contribute to the sediment deposit and soil fertility in the floodplain areas.

Please answer the following question: Being exposed to wind can cause erosion of soil, and soil erosion causes crop yields to decrease. Given these facts, what is a possible negative effect of exposing soil to wind among the following options: - It used to be covered by water - exposure to cold - decrease in crop yields - greater food production - elimination of harmful pests - a tree falling - wind power increases - Damages them Answer:","completion":"Among the given options, the negative effect of exposing soil to wind would be a decrease in crop yields. When soil is exposed to wind, the wind can erode the top layers of soil, which is a negative process for several reasons. Firstly, the top layer of soil is usually the most fertile, with higher concentrations of nutrients and organic matter that are critical for healthy plant growth. As the wind erodes the soil, these nutrients become depleted, resulting in poorer soil quality, which can adversely impact crop growth and ultimately lead to lower crop yields. Secondly, soil erosion can cause harmful sedimentation of nearby water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. As soil particles are carried away by the wind and deposited into these bodies of water, it may disrupt the aquatic ecosystem and lead to declines in biodiversity. This can have indirect negative effects on crop production, as some of these aquatic species play essential roles in maintaining a balanced ecosystem that supports agriculture. Lastly, soil erosion can lead to changes in soil structure, making it more difficult for crops to establish strong root systems. Poorly developed root systems can cause plants to be more susceptible to drought, disease, and other stress factors that may reduce crop yields further. In conclusion, exposing soil to wind has the potential to cause a decrease in crop yields due to the various negative consequences of soil erosion. Soil erosion can lead to the depletion of essential nutrients, disruption of aquatic ecosystems, and compromised root systems, all of which negatively impact crop growth and contribute to reduced agricultural production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: From James Dean to Growing Pains, Hollywood has long had a love affair with the relationship between teens and their parents. As the fascination with this relationship attests, parents play a crucial role in the development of their children's personalities. Teenagers learn by closely observing what people around them do. Parents are literally their first teachers and serve as role models. From hygiene to habits, from time management to personal manner, parents form the foundation of their children's characteristics. These tiny individual factors on our everyday behavior collectively constitute who we are. A second influence occurs at the spiritual level. Parental treatment of children is reflected in children's relationship with others. For example, my dad was quite angry with my study habits a few years back and lost his temper.I clearly remember that I too would easily lose my cool and shout at people, often saying things I later regretted, in those difficult days. Parents of my fellow classmates often tend to be anxious about the studies of their children, which can lead to a lack of confidence in their children. If we are boats weathering a storm as we navigate toward maturity, then parents should be our captains. It is as easy to lead us to shipwreck as is to take us ashore safely. To be fair, the guidance and influence of our parents are not the sole factors in molding us. There are numerous examples of teens forging their own paths and becoming something of which their parents never dreamed. Even so, parents must be a fundamental force that positively influences their children. At their best, they can help to solve teenage problems with a respect for their children's thoughts.

See options at the end Adam likes to fish and hunt at the campsite while Craig hides in the tent because Pick from: (I) Adam hates being in nature. (II) Craig hates being in nature.","completion":"Craig hates being in nature. So the complete sentence is: Adam likes to fish and hunt at the campsite while Craig hides in the tent because Craig hates being in nature. Now let us examine the personalities and preferences of Adam and Craig in order to understand their behaviors and choices better. Adam is an outdoor enthusiast, who revels in the opportunity to connect with nature and the wilderness. He thoroughly enjoys activities like fishing and hunting, which provide him not only with a sense of adventure but also the opportunity to practice his survival skills. For Adam, spending time at the campsite is a welcome break from daily routine and a way to recharge his batteries. He cherishes the sense of accomplishment that comes from catching a fish or successfully tracking and hunting an animal, and he values the lessons that nature imparts about resilience, resourcefulness, and adaptability. In contrast, Craig has an aversion to nature and the outdoors. He might find the unpredictability of wilderness unsettling or be overwhelmed by the sensory experiences that come with camping. It's likely that he's more comfortable in familiar surroundings, like the spaces that he has carefully nurtured and curated according to his own needs and preferences. Because Craig hates being in nature, he chooses to hide in the tent when he accompanies Adam to the campsite. His refuge might be due to practical concerns, like wanting to avoid insect bites, or it could be a form of psychological safety, helping to create a buffer between himself and the elements that he finds so disconcerting. The discrepancy between Adam and Craig's preferences can be attributed to various factors, such as their upbringing, past experiences, and innate predispositions. It is possible that Adam grew up in a family that encouraged outdoor activities and fostered a love for nature, while Craig might have been raised in an urban environment that led him to prioritize indoor activities and seek solace in human-made spaces. Experiences like an unfortunate encounter with wildlife, getting lost in a forest, or failing to adapt to harsh weather conditions could have contributed to Craig's aversion to nature. Moreover, some people are simply more innately inclined towards one environment over another due to their genetics or personality traits. Despite their contrasting preferences, Adam and Craig could ideally learn from each other and find a balance in their approach to the outdoors. Adam could help Craig develop an appreciation for nature by introducing him to less challenging activities that he might enjoy, such as bird-watching, stargazing, or leisurely nature walks. On the other hand, Craig could teach Adam the benefits of embracing indoor spaces and activities, for example, by sharing his hobbies or engaging in productive conversations away from the distractions of a busy world. In conclusion, Adam and Craig are two distinct individuals with opposing preferences when it comes to nature and the outdoors. While Adam is an outdoor enthusiast who loves engaging in activities like fishing and hunting, Craig strongly dislikes being in nature and chooses to hide in the tent while at the campsite. Their preferences might be based on various factors like upbringing, prior experiences, and innate tendencies. However, both could learn to accommodate each other's differences and strike a balanced relationship between nature and indoor spaces, ultimately enriching their bond and expanding their horizons."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: - three - five - seven - four A: Answer:","completion":"A: There are five visual clues to indicate a chemical reaction. These clues are: 1. Color change: A significant change in color can be observed when a chemical reaction occurs. For example, when copper reacts with nitric acid, it turns from reddish-brown to a blue-green solution. 2. Formation of a precipitate: A chemical reaction might cause the formation of a solid substance, also known as a precipitate, when two soluble reactants are mixed. For example, mixing silver nitrate and sodium chloride solutions results in the formation of a white precipitate of silver chloride. 3. Formation of a gas: A chemical reaction might produce a gas, which can be observed as bubbles forming in the reacting mixture. For example, the reaction between vinegar (acetic acid) and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) creates carbon dioxide gas, which causes fizzing and bubbling. 4. Release or absorption of heat: Some chemical reactions release heat (exothermic reactions), while others absorb heat (endothermic reactions). For example, burning fuel is an exothermic reaction, as it releases heat, whereas dissolving ammonium chloride in water is an endothermic reaction, as it absorbs heat and the mixture becomes cold. 5. Change in odor: A chemical reaction may release new or different odors that were not present originally. For example, the reaction between hydrogen sulfide gas and oxygen produces water and sulfur dioxide, which has a distinct smell different from the initial reactants.

The Supreme Court has rebuffed Virginia's request to reinstate the death sentence of a convicted killer who claims he is too mentally disabled to be executed. The justices on Monday did not comment in letting stand lower court rulings that threw out the sentence of death for Leon Winston, convicted in the shooting deaths of Anthony and Rhonda Robinson in 2002. Rhonda Robinson, who was pregnant, was shot to death in front of her 4- and 8-year-old daughters. The lower court concluded that Winston's lawyers did not try hard enough to show Winston was mentally disabled, and thus, ineligible to be executed under a 2002 Supreme Court ruling. The case is Pearson v. Winston, 12-492. ||||| The U.S. Supreme Court turned away an appeal by two men accused of illegally channeling more than 150,000 in corporate money to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. William P. Danielczyk Jr. and Eugene R. Biagi argued unsuccessfully that part of their indictment violated the constitutional free-speech guarantee and a 2010 Supreme Court decision that let corporations spend unlimited sums on elections. In rejecting the appeal today without comment, the high court declined a chance to expand the 2010 ruling, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, and allow direct corporate contributions to political candidates. The court said last week it will consider a different campaign-finance issue during the nine-month term that starts in October. In that case, Republicans are challenging federal limits on the total amount of money individuals can give to candidates, political parties and political committees every two years. Danielczyk and Biagi are accused of using funds from Galen Capital Corp. to reimburse so-called straw donors who gave money to Clinton’s campaign. Danielczyk was the chairman of Galen, based in McLean, Virginia, and Biagi was its secretary. A federal trial judge threw out one of the seven charges against the two men, saying the Citizens United decision meant that companies can make campaign donations directly to candidates as long as they comply with general legal limits. A federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, disagreed, saying the majority in the Citizens United case explicitly declined to allow corporate contributions. The indictment, which covers Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid and 2006 Senate run, also charges Danielczyk and Biagi with conspiracy, obstruction of justice and causing false statements.

You can also purchase ready-to-use crushed ice from a store. Alternatively, you may use an ice maker machine to produce crushed ice. 2. Pre-chill your cup: Before adding water and crushed ice, it's better to pre-chill your cup. This can be done by placing it in the refrigerator for at least 15-30 minutes prior to use. This step helps in maintaining a colder temperature for your water for an extended period. 3. Mix crushed ice and water: Half-fill your pre-chilled cup with crushed ice, then pour your water onto the ice. The crushed ice will immediately start to absorb heat from the water, causing the water temperature to drop. Ideally, you should use water that is already cool or at room temperature as this will require less energy from the ice to cool. 4. Stir the mixture: Use a spoon or straw to gently stir the water and crushed ice together. This will help the heat transfer process and ensure that the cold temperature is evenly distributed throughout the water. As the ice melts, it will further cool the water by diluting it with cold meltwater. 5. Add more crushed ice: If the water still isn't cold enough to your liking, feel free to add more crushed ice and stir again until you're satisfied with the temperature. 6. Enjoy your cold cup of water: Once you've achieved the desired temperature, enjoy your refreshing cup of chilled water! To maintain the cold temperature for a longer period, you can minimize heat transfer by using a cup with insulated walls or covering it with a coaster or lid. In conclusion, crushed ice is the most suitable and accessible option for cooling down your cup of water. By following the steps mentioned above, you can effectively lower the water's temperature and enjoy a chilled beverage. Other options such as liquid nitrogen, steam rooms, tidal waves, and oceans are either dangerous, impractical, or not directly applicable to cooling your cup of water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many independent commentators at the time regarded Ganic as a relative moderate in the wartime Bosnian leadership.

Given the question: Process: - Batteries are put in a flashlight - The flashlight is turned on - Two contact strips touch one another - A circuit is completed between the batteries and the lamp - The lamp in the flashlight begins to glow - The reflector in the flashlight directs the lamp's beam - A straight beam of light is generated - The flashlight is turned off - The circuit is broken - The beam is no longer visible. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the strips are not broken happens, how will it affect better flashlight usage. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have a significant effect on the process. The role of the contact strips inside a flashlight is crucial for its working mechanism. They carry the electric current from the battery to the lamp, completing the circuit. When the flashlight is turned on, it makes the two contact strips meet, closing the circuit and allowing the electricity to flow through the bulb, causing it to light up. If the strips are not separated (\\"not broken\\") when the flashlight is turned off, the circuit will not be broken. This would mean that electricity continues to flow from the battery to the lamp, causing the bulb to stay lit even when the flashlight switch is set to off. This situation will continue until the battery power is depleted. This perturbation would negatively affect the better usage of a flashlight because it prevents the device from being turned off, leading to a waste of battery power and reducing the useful lifespan of both the bulb and the batteries. In short, the ability to \\"break\\" or \\"open\\" the circuit by separating the contact strips is necessary for proper control of the flashlight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He said it's obvious Richard \\"Gary\\" Black saved the life of his grandson and protected other members of his family before getting shot by an officer. Metz said the department will not release body-worn camera video or the 911 audio recording of the incident. He said there was an issue with clarity regarding some of the recordings. The district attorney's office has asked the release of the video be withheld. The family wrote a letter to the Aurora Police Department that Metz read during the news conference. Please enable Javascript to watch this video In the letter, they asked that the body-cam video and the 911 call recordings not be released at this time. \\"The family desires space to grieve and does not wish to have the family in violent moments of Gary’s distinguished life be his public legacy,\\" the letter said. Metz said he will order an independent forensic review of body cam footage and 911 call surrounding Black’s death. Metz said Black's family watched the body-cam video and they also listened to the 911 recording. The suspect in the home invasion, 26-year-old Dajon Harper, was at party across the street from Black’s home and became “out of control,” Metz said. He started damaging cars in the neighborhood. Multiple calls came into 911. Metz said Harper somehow knocked the door to Black’s home off its hinges. Once inside, Harper grabbed Black’s 11-year-old grandchild and put the him in a bathroom and violently assaulted the child. Speaking about one of the 911 calls, Metz said there was no physical description given to 911 of what the suspect looked like. The caller said the suspect was in the bathroom and there was lots of blood everywhere. Police did release a recording of dispatchers communicating with officers. Metz said there was upward of 10 people inside Black's home when police arrived. He said people came in to try to get the intruder out. Metz then described what is shown on the officer's body-worn camera. There were numerous people outside the house with lots of yelling with people saying a child is being hurt. Black's wife told officers, \\"He has a gun,\\" and then shots are heard inside the home. This was shot within 33 seconds of arrival. Metz said officers saw Black walking with a gun and flashlight. Officers say they gave \\"at least five commands\\" to tell Black to drop the gun. Black raised the flashlight. Metz said it was at that time the officer fired four rounds at Black and he fell to the ground. Metz said Black had \\"significant hearing impairment\\" from his time in the military. The attorney for the family has said Black's wife gave a detailed description of Black to police. Metz acknowledges she was involved in a stressful situation. Metz said a review of the 911 tapes found no description given of Gary Black. Metz said two minutes and 27 seconds went by from when police arrived at the home to when they entered the bathroom in the home where the boy was injured, and Harper was dead. The police chief said the officer ran into \\"an incredibly dangerous\\" situation. The officer has been with department for three years and is a military veteran. He described the officer as heartbroken. The same officer was involved in another shooting on June 27 in the 8900 block of East Colfax Avenue. He returned to duty 18 days later after completing all requirements needed to return. \\"Officers responded how I would expect them to respond in that situation ... they put themselves in harm's way to save lives,\\" Metz said. Police released recordings of police dispatch conversations and some 911 call recordings. Warning: The graphic nature and language used in some of the audio may not be appropriate for all listeners. ||||| The Purple Heart and Bronze Star recipient who was killed by Colorado police after he saved his grandson from a home intruder did not follow officers' orders to drop his gun, Aurora Police Chief Nicholas Metz said in a press conference Thursday. Richard \\"Gary\\" Black, 73, shot and killed the suspect, 26-year-old Dajon Harper, as Harper allegedly \\"violently and seriously\\" assaulted Black's 11-year-old grandson in the bathroom of the Aurora home early Monday morning, Metz said. Officers heard shots fired inside the home within three minutes of arriving on the scene, Metz said. When Black came into view, they observed that he had a firearm and instructed him multiple times to \\"the drop gun and to show his hands,\\" Metz said. After the shooting, investigators learned from Black's family that the Vietnam War veteran had \\"a significant hearing impairment.\\" \\"I don’t know what he was able to hear and not hear,\\" Metz said. About 3 days after the shooting, Metz, having reviewed the body camera footage and 911 dispatch calls, shared more details on what transpired early Monday morning when Black was killed. A house party gone wrong Police began receiving 911 calls around 1:30 a.m. Monday from a house party Harper attended across the street from Black's home. The calls detailed that Harper had become \\"out of control,\\" Metz said. Harper had been \\"acting irrationally\\" and damaged cars in the area, and even injured himself in the process, Metz said. Aurora Police Department It was difficult to get information from the callers at that point due to the commotion, Metz said. One person who hung up and was called back by emergency dispatchers told them, \\"I don't know where I am. Just get here,\\" Metz said. At that point, there was \\"still no description provided to our dispatch as to what this person looked like who was out of control,\\" Metz said. Harper then allegedly ran across the street to Black's home and banged on the \\"very solid door\\" so hard that he knocked it off its hinges and entered the home, Metz said. A number of people ran in after him in an effort to get him out of the house, but they were not able to, Metz said. Harper allegedly dragged Black's grandson into a bathroom After going into Black's home, Harper allegedly dragged Black's 11-year-old grandson into a bathroom and \\"violently assaulted\\" him, Metz said, declining to describe the crime further. When Black's wife called 911, she told dispatchers that the \\"man who entered was trying to drown\\" her grandson, Metz said, adding that her 911 call was \\"incredibly difficult\\" to listen to because of all of the screaming that could be heard in the background. Black's wife told dispatchers that a person was in the bathroom \\"hurting the child,\\" and that there \\"was lots of blood everywhere,\\" Metz said. When the dispatcher asked Black's wife whether there were weapons, she replied, \\"No,\\" Metz said. Another 911 from a family member of Harper's indicated that he was \\"on drugs,\\" Metz said, but it is unclear what kind of drugs the caller was referring to. Police arrived to an \\"incredibly chaotic situation.\\" The body camera video worn by the officer who shot Black began as he and another officer responded to the incident, Metz said. Once they arrived and got out of the car, they encountered several people yelling in front of the home who appear \\"very agitated\\" and \\"very emotional,\\" Metz said. The group informed the officers that they tried to get into the home and that Harper was allegedly \\"hurting the child,\\" Metz said. As the officers walk up to the home, Black's wife can be heard saying, \\"He has a gun,\\" Metz said, but it is unclear who she is referring to. As officers walked toward the house, they heard shots fired, \\"within 33 seconds of their arrival on scene,\\" as well as \\"a lot of screaming inside the home,\\" Metz said. After taking a step back from the front door, the officers saw Black emerge from behind a wall about 15 to 20 feet away inside holding a gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other hand, Metz said. For the next 13 seconds, officers gave commands to Black to drop the weapon and show his hands, but he didn't, Metz said. Ten seconds later, Black walked toward officers with the gun and flashlight still in his hands, prompting the officer to fire four rounds at him. It is unclear how many times Black was struck. After Black fell to the ground, the officer dispatched for medical attention and continued to give Black orders to show his hands, Metz said. He then directed other officers to provide aid to Black as he and two more officers continued \\"forward to where the screaming was coming from.\\" While on the ground, Black was able to tell officers that his son and grandson were in the bathroom, Metz said. KMGH When the officers got to the bathroom, they found a \\"deceased, nude man on the floor,\\" and the 11-year-old and his father in the bathtub -- a mere 2 minutes and 27 seconds after they arrived on the scene, Metz said. The child was screaming that Harper \\"was the one that assaulted him\\" and gave \\"pretty graphic details\\" of what happened to him, Metz said. Once the scene was secured, Black was transported to a local hospital, where he died from his injuries, Metz said. Authorities are not yet releasing the 911 calls or body camera footage at this time, at the request of prosecutors and Black's family, Metz said. The footage will be released at a later time, once the investigation is over and a forensic review has been conducted on the portions that are inaudible, Metz said. \\"We are supportive of releasing it,\\" Metz said. \\"I want to make that very clear.\\" The officer who shot Black is a veteran himself Metz did not release the identity of the shooting officer. The officer has been with the Aurora Police Department for three years and had just been reviewed for another police-involved shooting that took place 30 days prior, Metz said. He returned to duty 18 days after the shooting after receiving peer support and spending time with the department's psychological services, Metz said. Metz chalked the proximity of the two shootings to coincidence and praised the way he handled the situation. \\"We can't control the kinds of situations that our officers are going to be called to -- whether it's a week later or a year later,\\" he said. \\"I feel bad for this officer. Unfortunately, lightning struck twice for him. But, when I watched that video, I'm impressed at his ability to remain calm.\\" Black Family Metz disputed claims that the officers acted recklessly in their response. \\"They were not reckless,\\" he said. \\"These officers responded, again, how I would expect them to respond in this situation, given the limited amount of information.\\" The shooting officer, who works the graveyard shift patrolling northeast Aurora, has been placed on paid administrative leave -- as have the other officers involved, Metz said. He has had no prior internal affairs complaints, Metz said. Black's death \\"has been devastating\\" for the officer, a military veteran himself who has served on two deployments, Metz said. Black's family is \\"incredibly traumatized.\\" Black \\"saved the family's life that night, in particular, his young grandson,\\" Metz said. The grieving family is \\"incredibly traumatized,\\" Metz said. Black received his Purple Heart and Bronze Star medals for courageous service with the U.S. Army in Vietnam, where, according to his family, he was taken prisoner and injured multiple times. After he returned from the war, Black worked as a federal employee before retiring in 2015, Metz said. \\"My dad was a hero, period,\\" Black's stepson, Chad Hayashi, told ABC News on Wednesday. \\"He's been a hero in this country since 1966, and he needs to be recognized as such.\\" KMGH Metz described his meeting with Black's family on Thursday morning as \\"helpful\\" and \\"healing.\\" There, he spoke with Black's wife, who regaled stories to the police chief about how they met, how long they'd been together and \\"funny stories\\" they shared throughout their life together, Metz said. \\"The family acknowledges that the responding officers did not receive a description\\" of the suspect, Metz said. Black \\"deeply appreciated law enforcement,\\" Metz said. Through local organization Cops Fighting Cancer, Black's wife would create quilts for young patients battling serious illnesses at local children's hospitals, the family's letter stated. The police department \\"continues to remain heartbroken\\" over Black's death, he said. Harper has an \\"extensive and violent background\\" Harper had been arrested twice on suspicion of first-degree murder, once in 2011 and again in 2013, according to Colorado Bureau of Investigation records obtained by ABC Denver affiliate KMGH-TV. Both times the charges were either dropped or reduced, according to the CBI records. KMGH The families who lived in the two homes did not know each other, Metz said. \\"It appears to be completely random,\\" he said of the encounter. ABC News' Bill Hutchinson and Clayton Sandell contributed to this report. ||||| Aurora police officers ordered the man they fatally shot while protecting his home early Monday to drop his gun multiple times, but they did not identify themselves as police before an officer fired four shots, Chief Nick Metz said. Multiple officers already had heard gunshots from inside the home at 10609 E. Montview Blvd. and were standing near the front door’s threshold, looking into the well-lit home when they saw homeowner Gary Black come around a corner holding a gun and a flashlight, Metz said. “For the next 13 seconds, officers continued to give at least five commands to Mr. Black to drop the gun and to show his hands,” Metz said Thursday at a news conference. “We don’t know why, but for whatever reason Mr. Black did not drop the gun.” Black had significant hearing impairment because of his military service, Metz said. Also, the scene was noisy from people screaming, including Black’s 11-year-old grandson, who had been violently attacked by a naked intruder. For the first time since the early Monday morning shooting, Metz addressed the media about what happened in the early morning hours when a naked stranger burst through the front door of the Black family home and began attacking the grandson sleeping on the couch. Black, a decorated Vietnam veteran and retired federal government employee, grabbed his 9mm pistol and killed the intruder, 26-year-old Dajon Harper. Metz defended the actions of his officers, including the one who fired the fatal shots, and said tears had been shed at the Aurora Police Department over the tragedy. He said threats had been made against Aurora police officers in connection with the shooting. “There was a reference that our officers acted recklessly,” Metz said. “I dispute that strongly. They were not reckless. They responded how I would expect them to respond given the limited amount of information they were given.” Metz also hailed Black as a hero for defending his family. “There’s no doubt in my mind in any shape or form that Mr. Black saved his family’s life that night,” Metz said. Metz played audio between officers and a dispatcher and released five 911 calls from nearby residents and people attending a party where Harper had been. But he will not released the body camera footage from officers at the request of the 17th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which is conducting the ongoing criminal investigation into the police shooting, and because the Black family has asked that it be withheld. In a statement, the family said, “The family desires space to grieve and does not wish to have the final and violent moments of Gary’s distinguished life be his public legacy.” Metz insisted officers were not given a physical description of the suspect, but he also admitted that large portions of the 911 calls and body camera videos are inaudible because of screaming and yelling. Earlier this week, attorneys representing the Black family said Jeanette Black, the wife, had told 911 operators and officer on the scene that her husband was white and wearing a bathrobe. But Metz said that cannot be heard on the 911 audio or body camera videos. Metz promised to hire forensic audio experts to try to interpret the garbled sounds. When Jeanette Black called 911, an operator asked whether anyone had weapons, Metz said. “The caller asks somebody else, ‘Are there weapons?’ and the answer came back as no,” Metz said. There was no physical description of the suspect. The caller said the person was in the bathroom and hurting the child. The caller said there was lots of blood everywhere, Metz said. When officers arrived on scene, however, Jeanette Black said, “He has a gun,” according to Metz, who has listened to the audio from police radio and watched the body camera footage. Metz said he allowed the Black family to watch the videos and listen to the audio recordings on Thursday. The Black family said in its statement, “The 911 telephone call by Mrs. Black was difficult to understand as large portions are unintelligible. The family acknowledges the APD’s position that the responding officers did not receive a description of the intruders.” Police first responded to the neighborhood around 1:30 a.m. after multiple people called from a party at a home on the corner of Iola Street and Montview Boulevard. One caller, who identified herself as the intruder’s mother, told police that her son was on drugs, had kicked in a neighbor’s door and was drowning a baby. Several times, she quit talking to the operator and could be heard screaming at her son and others in the house. “My son is on something,” she said. Toward the end of the call the woman suddenly yelled, “They killed my son. They killed him.” There was loud wailing and then the call ended. Another caller told 911 that people were fighting and she could hear someone breaking glass. But other callers hung up without providing information about their location or what was happening. “I cannot talk on the phone. Just please get here. Hurry,” one caller said and then hung up. Harper, for unknown reasons, ran to the Black home and began pounding on the door. He knocked the door off its hinges and went inside. He grabbed the 11-year-old boy sleeping on the couch and took him into a bathroom where he began choking and attempting to drown the child, Metz said. “I won’t go into the graphic details other than to say the child was violently assaulted,” he said. Multiple people from the party had followed Harper into the house to try to stop him, Metz said. That contributed to the chaos for the officers and the Black family, he said. After officers heard the gunshots, they saw Black walk around a corner and then turn back. He came toward them again as they ordered him to drop the gun. Black raised his flashlight toward them before the one officer fired, Metz said. “It was that time my officer fired four rounds, causing Mr. Black to fall to the ground,” Metz said. The chief refused to speculate as to why other officers decided to hold their fire, and he did not give details as to where each officer was standing as Black approached. “I wanted to give you a picture of what was going in that house. It was a very chaotic situation. A very violent situation,” Metz said. Metz confirmed that the officer who fatally shot Black was the same one involved in a fatal shooting in late June. Metz said the officer, who has not been identified but is a three-year department veteran, went through all the requirements necessary to come back after a shooting, including peer support, psychiatric services and gun range training. He spent 15 days on leave before being declared fit for duty. “I believe this officer was ready to go back,” Metz said. Because of the officer is under investigation for two shootings, Metz said he asked the 18th and 17th judicial district attorney’s offices to expedite their investigations. The 18th Judicial District is investigating the June 27 shooting outside an East Colfax Avenue motel. Jess Redman, assistant district attorney for the 17th Judicial District, said he wanted to uphold the integrity of the investigation and had asked that body camera footage and Jeanette Black’s 911 call be withheld. “I’m committed to the victims of crime and in this scenario that’s the Black family and the Harper family,” Redman said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Aurora Police Chief Nick Metz reported that Richard \\"Gary\\" Black, a 73-year-old homeowner, saved his grandson and protected his family from an intruder before being shot by an officer.

Moreover, the ads were intrusive and excessive, interrupting the gameplay constantly and making the experience exponentially worse.

However, I can elaborate on possible scenarios based on the given options: 1. Be admired by fellow workers: If Lee approached their boss with a professional attitude, a clear plan, and a willingness to grow, their co-workers may perceive this positively. They might admire Lee's initiative, drive, and commitment to self-improvement. This could result in increased respect and better relationships with colleagues. 2. Look like a bad person: In some situations where office politics or toxic work culture prevails, openly discussing progress with the boss might be seen as an attempt to curry favor or undermine others. In such cases, discussing personal growth objectives with the boss could be perceived negatively by co-workers, who might see Lee as a threat or someone trying to manipulate the situation for their own benefit. 3. Laughed at by workers: If the conversation between Lee and the boss were to become public knowledge or if Lee approached the discussion in an inappropriate or comical way, co-workers might perceive it as a humorous or ridiculous situation. In this case, Lee might not be taken seriously or could be the subject of office gossip and jokes.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When US student Olivia Priedeman, 17, woke up one morning, she thought she had had a dream about making plans with a friend. But it wasn't a dream. Her phone showed that during the night, Priedeman had read a text message from her friend. She did it while she was fast asleep. Reading and sending text messages while asleep--called \\"sleep texting\\"--is an unusual sleep behaviour, similar to sleepwalking. It's also a growing concern among doctors: young people can't live without their cell phones. One in three teenagers sends more than 100 text messages a day, according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project. And at least four out of five teenagers said they sleep with their phone on or near their bed. Elizabeth Dowdell, a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has studied sleeping texting. She said that having a phone nearby all night is a big part of the problem. Andrew Stiehm, a sleep medicine expert with Allina Health in Minnesota, agrees. It's possible for the part of the brain that controls motor skills to wake up, while the part of the brain that controls memory and judgment may be still asleep. That's why some people can perform basic movements ---such as walking, talking, texting or even driving--while they're sleeping. Some of Dowdell's students said that they're disturbed by their nighttime texting behavior. But because sleep texting is _ , it's a difficult habit to break. Dowdell said she knows of some students who wear socks on their hands to keep themselves from texting. Marjorie Hogan, a doctor at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, suggests keeping all electronic devices outside the bedroom at certain times. Question: What does doctor Hogan suggest people who sleep text do? Answer: Pick from: (A). Stop text during the daytime. (B). Take some medicine to control the behaviour. (C).

A benefits cheat caught hula dancing on holiday after claiming to be wheelchair bound must pay more than £300,000 or face a longer prison sentence. Abdul Esfandmozd, 52, will have at least five years added to his four-year sentence if he does not pay the money. He claimed to be disabled for ten years, pocketing nearly £100,000 in benefits, but was caught out when council officers noticed fake names on records he was meant to keep of money he spent on carers. 'Living a lie': Abdul Esfandmozd, 52, pocketed public money meant for carers and spent it on exotic holiday and building a property empire. Scam: A raid on his home uncovered pictures of him on holiday hula dancing, diving into a pool and lifting a woman up, as well as home videos of him walking long distances. In August, Esfandmozd was found guilty of fraud, obtaining money by deception and entering into a money laundering arrangement. He had to reappear before Portsmouth Crown Court to hear a judge’s verdict on how the money he made with his scam should be recouped. Despite being exposed as a cheat, Esfandmozd still insisted on using his wheelchair to attend the hearing. Judge Sarah Munro QC ruled that his total gain through crime was £318,593.21 and gave him nine months to pay up. She repeatedly had to ask him to be quiet as he shouted ‘I still trust British justice’ from the back of the court. The sum includes £140,000 from the Department for Work and Pensions that he was not prosecuted for and the profits for two properties that he bought with his ill-gotten money. Out for a stroll: He was found guilty of two counts of fraud, two of obtaining money by deception and three of entering into a money laundering arrangement. Whale of a time: Despite being outed as a liar, Esfandmozd still insisted on using his wheelchair to attend the hearing at Portsmouth Crown Court. Michael Lawther, solicitor for Portsmouth City Council, said: ‘Esfandmozd stole a substantial amount of money from taxpayers. We’re pleased we’ll be able to recover it.’ A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said that Esfandmozd’s property could be seized to pay the order. Between 2000 and 2010, Esfandmozd claimed £93,730 in disability payments from the council. He said he was incapable of standing or walking without crutches and used an electric wheelchair to get around. He was supposed to spend the money on carers and neighbours were fooled by his supposedly modest lifestyle. But instead he took regular holidays to America, Cyprus and Malta and invested in property. The scam came to light when council officers noticed paperwork for the care work he was supposed to be buying was not in order. Good times: Neighbours were fooled by his supposedly modest lifestyle, but meanwhile the conman was enjoying a luxury lifestyle. Forms on which he was meant to list carers’ names included former England goalkeeper P Shilton, athlete D Thompson and even a Mr D Duck. A raid of his flat in Somers Town, Hampshire, uncovered home videos of him on holiday, dancing, swimming and even lifting a woman up. There were also six hours of home videos of him filmed on holiday in which he was shown walking long distances. Sentencing him, Judge Munro said: ‘You are in my view one of the most dishonest and manipulative individuals ever to have come before this court.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Abdul Esfandmozd, a 52-year-old benefits cheat, was caught hula dancing on holiday despite claiming to be wheelchair-bound for ten years.

On the death of her husband Ada became satrap of Caria , but was expelled by her brother Pixodarus in 340 BC. Ada fled to the fortress of Alinda , where she maintained her rule in exile . When Alexander the Great entered Caria in 334 BC , Ada adopted Alexander as her son and surrendered Alinda to him . In return , Alexander accepted the offer and gave Ada formal command of the Siege of Halicarnassus . After the fall of Halicarnassus , Alexander returned Alinda and made Ada queen of the whole of Caria . Ada 's popularity with the populace in turn ensured the Carians ' loyalty to Alexander . According to Turkish archaeologists , the tomb of Ada has been discovered , although this claim remains unresolved . Her remains are on display in the archaeological museum of Bodrum . - The Hecatomnid dynasty or Hecatomnids were the rulers of Caria and surrounding areas from about 395334 BCE. They were nominally satraps (governors) under the Persian Achaeminid Empire, but ruled with considerable autonomy, and established a hereditary dynasty. The dynasty was founded by Hecatomnus and originally had its seat in Mylasa; Mausolus moved it to Halicarnassus. - Satraps (Old Persian: xšarapwn) were the governors of the provinces of the ancient Median and Achaemenid (Persian) Empires and in several of their successors, such as the Sasanian Empire and the Hellenistic empires. - Mycale. also Mykale and Mykali, called Samsun Da and Dilek Da (Dilek Peninsula) in modern Turkey, is a mountain on the west coast of central Anatolia in Turkey, north of the mouth of the Maeander and divided from the Greek island of Samos by the 1.6 km wide Mycale Strait. The mountain forms a ridge, terminating in what was known anciently as the Trogilium promontory (Ancient Greek or ). There are several beaches on the north shore ranging from sand to pebbles. The south flank is mainly escarpment. - A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy. - The Old Persian language is one of the two directly attested Old Iranian languages (the other being Avestan). Old Persian appears primarily in the inscriptions, clay tablets, and seals of the Achaemenid era (c. 600 BCE to 300 BCE). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now present-day Iran, Romania (Gherla), Armenia, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt, the most important attestation by far being the contents of the Behistun Inscription (dated to 525 BCE). Recent research into the vast Persepolis Fortification Archive at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago have unearthed Old Persian tablets (2007). This new text shows that the Old Persian language was a written language in use for practical recording and not only for royal display. - The Sasanian Empire (or ), also known as Sassanian, Sasanid, Sassanid or Neo-Persian Empire), known to its inhabitants as rnshahr in Middle Persian, was the last imperial dynasty in Persia (Iran) before the rise of Islam, ruled by and named after the Sasanian dynasty from 224 to 651 AD. The Sasanian Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighboring arch-rival the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years. - Caria (from Luwian: \\"Karuwa\\", \\"steep country\\"; Ancient Greek: , \\"Karia\\") was a region of western Anatolia extending along the coast from mid-Ionia (Mycale) south to Lycia and east to Phrygia. The Ionian and Dorian Greeks colonized the west of it and joined the Carian population in forming Greek-dominated states there. The inhabitants of Caria, known as Carians, had arrived there before the Greeks. They were described by Herodotos as being of Minoan descent, while the Carians themselves maintained that they were Anatolian mainlanders intensely engaged in seafaring and were akin to the Mysians and the Lydians. The Carians did speak an Anatolian language, known as Carian, which does not necessarily reflect their geographic origin, as Anatolian once may have been widespread. Also closely associated with the Carians were the Leleges, which could be an earlier name for Carians or for a people who had preceded them in the region and continued to exist as part of their society in a reputedly second-class status. - Hecatomnus of Mylasa or Hekatomnos was an early 4th-century BC ruler of Caria. He was the satrap (governor) of Caria for the Persian Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II (404358 BC). However, the basis for Hecatomnus' political power was twofold: he was both a high appointed Persian official and a powerful local dynast, who founded the hereditary dynasty of the Hecatomnids.

Překlad do češtiny: V češtině se \\"I am a liar.\\" překládá jako \\"Jsem lhář.\\" Tato věta je jednoduchá slovní spojení, které se skládá ze tří částí: podmět (I - já), sloveso (am - jsem) a přívlastek (a liar - lhář). Jde o prostou větu oznamovací, která popisuje identitu mluvčího nebo psavce jako lháře. Český jazyk patří do skupiny západoslovanských jazyků a jeho struktura se může lišit od angličtiny, která patří do skupiny germánských jazyků. Hlavní gramatické rozdíly mezi angličtinou a češtinou zahrnují: 1. Český jazyk má sedm pádů, zatímco angličtina má pouze tři (nominativ, genitiv a akuzativ). Pády jsou gramatické kategorie, které ovlivňují tvar substantiv, adjektiv a zájmen, aby vyjádřily vztah mezi slovy ve větě. 2. Slovosled v češtině je volnější než v angličtině, protože většina gramatických informací je již zakódována do tvaru slov. To znamená, že česky můžete říci \\"Jsem lhář.\\", \\"Lhář jsem.\\" nebo \\"Já jsem lhář.\\" a všechna tato spojení budou mít stejný význam. 3. V češtině se používají ohyby, které slouží k označení gramatických funkcí slov ve větě. Naopak, angličtina používá více předložek a pomocných slov. S ohledem na tyto gramatické rozdíly je důležité při překladu mezi češtinou a angličtinou respektovat specifika obou jazyků. Při překládání věty \\"I am a liar.\\" do češtiny je nutné nejdříve zaměřit se na podmět \\"I\\" (já), poté sloveso \\"am\\" (jsem) a nakonec přívlastek \\"a liar\\" (lhář).

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","completion":"From the given sentence, \\"Trance music has its origins in House music,\\" we can extract several pieces of information, which can be categorized and analyzed in different ways. 1. Genres of Music: The sentence introduces two distinct genres of music, namely Trance music and House music. These are subgenres of Electronic Dance Music (EDM), characterized by different musical elements, instruments, and structures. 2. Origin and Development: The sentence establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between the two genres by stating that Trance music has its origins in House music. This implies that Trance music evolved from or was influenced by House music, either through blending with other musical styles or through its experimentation and innovation. 3. Timeline: Although no specific dates or time periods are mentioned in the sentence, we can infer that House music pre-dates Trance music. Since House music originated in the early 1980s, we can deduce that Trance music development began sometime after that. 4. Cultural and Geographical Context: The sentence does not explicitly mention the geographical roots of these genres, but we can deduce some context from the mention of the genres themselves. House music originated in the United States, specifically in Chicago, while Trance music is believed to have originated in Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This information can lead to further exploration into regional differences and influences on the development of these musical styles. 5. Elements and Characteristics: The sentence, though brief, allows us to delve deeper into the musical characteristics of both Trance and House music. For example, we might explore the specific elements, structures, and features that Trance music borrowed or adapted from House music, such as tempo, rhythm patterns, synthesizers, drum machines, and melodies. 6. Musical Evolution: The statement suggests that the development of Trance music is not an isolated phenomenon but rather part of the larger evolution of EDM. This may lead to a discussion on how genres within EDM might have influenced each other over time, including their characteristics and notable artists, producers, and events in the respective genres. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Trance music has its origins in House music\\" provides valuable information about the relationship between two genres of music, their origin, development, and context.

Since 2001, the band's line-up has included vocalist and rhythm guitarist Duff McKagan (Velvet Revolver and Guns N' Roses), lead guitarist Mike Squires (formerly of Nevada Bachelors and Alien Crime Syndicate) and bassist Jeff Rouse (formerly of Alien Crime Syndicate, Sirens Sister, and Vendetta Red). Since 2009, Isaac Carpenter (formerly of Loudermilk, Gosling, and The Exies) has been the band's drummer, replacing Geoff Reading (formerly of New American Shame and Green Apple Quick Step). McKagan first formed Loaded to be his touring band in support of his unreleased solo album Beautiful Disease. Duff McKagan was previously a member of Guns N' Roses from the mid-1980s to late 1990s. Guns N' Roses achieved international success, going on to sell over 100 million albums worldwide, but the strain between singer Axl Rose and the rest of the band led to a number of members leaving or being fired, with McKagan departing in 1997. McKagan moved back to Seattle, reforming previous group 10 Minute Warning, releasing one self-titled album on Sub Pop in 1998, before recording his second solo album Beautiful Disease the same year. Featuring collaborations with former Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin, former Black Flag singer Dez Cadena and his former Guns N' Roses band mates Slash and Izzy Stradlin, Beautiful Disease was scheduled to be released through Geffen in 1999. McKagan formed Loaded, initially as The Gentlemen, to be his band for the tour supporting the album. With McKagan performing lead vocals and bass duties, Loaded's line-up consisted of guitarists Dez Cadena and Michael Barragan as well as drummer Taz Bentley. McKagan began promoting the album; however, following the merger between Geffen and Interscope Records, he was dropped from the label and lost all commercial rights to release the record with only a few promo copies being leaked. Loaded continued to tour and released a live album, Episode 1999: Live, independently, which was recorded and mixed by Nick Raskulinecz. They re-recorded half of Beautiful Disease and received offers from four labels. However, they disbanded before the end of the year, with McKagan and Bentley becoming part of Izzy Stradlin's rhythm section for his tour of Japan supporting Ride On.

Please answer the following question: Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

Question: Which came first, University of Cologne or monastic schools? Context: European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries. Answer:","completion":"Monastic schools came first.

The output should be the list of prime numbers in the input list. If there are no primes in the input list an empty list (\\"[]\\") should be returned.

We do this by iterating through each integer in the input list and checking if it is prime. We can check if a number is prime by dividing it by all smaller positive integers greater than 1. If the integer is divisible by any of these smaller integers, it is not prime. To optimize this process, we can stop checking when the smaller integer is greater than the square root of the number being tested. In this case, we have the input list: [801, 55, 3, 768, 197, 677, 103, 739, 89, 849, 769] We iterate through each integer and check if it is prime: 801 - Not prime (divisible by 3) 55 - Not prime (divisible by 5) 3 - Prime 768 - Not prime (divisible by 2) 197 - Prime 677 - Prime 103 - Prime 739 - Prime 89 - Prime 849 - Not prime (divisible by 3) 769 - Not prime (divisible by 769) After identifying the prime numbers, we can create a new list containing only the prime numbers. So the final list of prime numbers is: [3, 197, 677, 103, 739, 89] Thus, the answer is [3, 197, 677, 103, 739, 89]."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But the digital age and pressure of time is consigning antenatal classes to online tutorials. A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to a decision to phase them out but critics are disappointed that the classes are being 'abandoned'. Parenting charity NCT said the move online will put parents at a disadvantage but York Hospital insists the virtual classes will allow expectant mothers to access important information. A hospital is to become the first in the country to replace antenatal lessons. with 'virtual classes' to be watched online. A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to the decision. All of the same information will be available online with virtual classes filmed at the maternity suite at York Hospital showing its staff and labour rooms. The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing, the early stages of labour, and explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief as well as breast feeding and what can be expected after birth. Midwife Sue Jackson said the films will familiarise the majority of women who are not going to classes with the staff and facilities. She said: 'It should open up the information available to women much more effectively than what we have at the moment. We have to make sure the service is appropriate and is being accessed appropriately.' York Hospital said antenatal classes will still be held for teenage mothers and women giving birth to more than one baby. The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing and the early stages of labour. They will also include an explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief, breast feeding and what can be expected after the birth. Women will continue to see a midwife who will answer any questions and give guidance. But the parenting charity NCT has said it is disappointed antenatal classes were being 'abandoned altogether'. Belinda Phipps, chief executive, said: 'There is currently no evidence to show that online courses are as good as traditional antenatal courses. 'Replacing the courses with an online-only system could put parents at a disadvantage. 'Antenatal education is not just about the transfer of information, but also the support you get from the parents that you meet.' York Hospital said other relevant information to mums will also be available on the site, including information about healthy eating and frequently asked questions.","completion":"This article talks about how some hospitals are changing the way they teach parents-to-be about having a baby.

In these online classes, people can learn about things like relaxing, what happens during labor, and how to take care of a baby after it's born.

I eat a snack before getting up, and then I quickly pack my sleeping bag, tent, and other things and get on the road. Usually I have less speed. Traveling by bike allows me to stop anywhere, such as lakes(especially places to swim), woods, and scenic spots .

In the late afternoon, I start thinking about stopping. I finally find a place in the early evening, cook a simple meal, and rest and cool off. As it starts to get dark, I put up my tent, and fall asleep. There are exciting times and difficult times as well. Visiting strange or famous places are always exciting to me.

She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at château d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England. At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House, a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped. Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances.

Option (i): Angle the toothbrush upwards when brushing, that way you'll clean under your gums. 1. Angling the toothbrush upwards allows for better reach and cleaning around the gum line. 2. By angling upwards, the bristles are able to go deeper between the teeth and effectively remove any trapped food or debris. Option (ii): Angle the toothbrush in front of your lips when brushing, that way you'll clean under your gums. 1. Angling the toothbrush in front of the lips does not provide an efficient angle for cleaning under the gums. 2. This position would focus mainly on the visible surfaces of the teeth and may not clean the gum line or in-between the teeth properly. Justification: After analyzing both options, it is clear that Option (i) is a better solution to achieve the goal of brushing teeth effectively since it focuses on cleaning under the gums, around the gum line, and in-between the teeth.

A:","completion":"No, \\"needed to get lost\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\" due to the following reasons. 1. Misaligned Motivation: The phrase \\"needed to get lost\\" indicates that Kendall may intentionally want to be lost, but based on the situation described, her primary motivation is likely to find the correct class as soon as possible. As a new student, Kendall would most likely want to make a good impression and minimizing any confusion or mistakes would be of high importance. 2.

Based on the premise \\"If this recommendation is too narrowly defined, we will encourage people to look at small things like training programs.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"People need to train \\" is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it may not be conclusively appropriate to directly assert that the hypothesis \\"People need to train\\" is true. However, there is an implicit association between the premise and the hypothesis. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of this connection, it is essential to break down the various components, consider different perspectives, and analyze the potential implications of the premise. The premise states, \\"If this recommendation is too narrowly defined, we will encourage people to look at small things like training programs.\\" The first aspect to consider is the meaning of 'too narrowly defined.' This expression implies that the recommendation at hand may restrict its focus to a limited set of variables or aspects, thereby inadvertently excluding other relevant considerations. Consequently, individuals seeking guidance might be motivated to explore more narrowly scoped matters, such as specific training programs, which could contribute to their growth and development. By mentioning training programs, the premise acknowledges the role of training in personal and professional development. Thus, the hypothesis \\"People need to train\\" does bear relevance in this context, as it aligns with the idea that individuals should engage in activities that enhance their skills and capabilities. However, the premise's primary concern lies with the consequences of a too narrowly defined recommendation. The suggestion is that such a recommendation may lead people to focus primarily on small things like training, potentially resulting in overlooking other important aspects that contribute to development. This consequence underscores the need for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to providing recommendations to people. The hypothesis \\"People need to train\\" is not explicitly supported by the premise, but it does resonate with the underlying sentiment. Training can indeed be beneficial, but if people exclusively concentrate on it as a result of a narrowly defined recommendation, they might miss other crucial factors that contribute to their overall growth. These other factors might include mentorship, networking, work-life balance, mental and physical wellness, and continued education, among others. In conclusion, while the hypothesis \\"People need to train\\" is not directly proven by the premise, it is implicitly associated with the understanding that training can be an essential component of self-improvement. The premise mainly highlights the potential pitfalls of an overly narrow recommendation, which might lead individuals to focus on small things to their developmental detriment. A more balanced and comprehensive perspective is necessary to ensure a well-rounded approach to growth and development, which may indeed include training as one of the critical elements."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Rescue workers attempt to find survivors from the rubble of the collapsed Rana Plaza building in Savar, around 30 km (19 miles) outside Dhaka May 4, 2013. DHAKA Bangladeshi salvage workers on Monday neared the end of their search for victims of the collapse of a factory building, scouring the basement of the complex that crumbled in on itself and killed 1,127 people. A series of deadly incidents at factories, including a fire in November that killed 112 people, has focused global attention on safety standards in Bangladesh's booming garment industry. The toll of 1,127 - the world's most deadly industrial accident since 1984 Bhopal disaster in India - could be the final one as no more bodies were found on Monday, a spokesman at the army control room coordinating the salvage operation said. \\"The rescuers have reached the basement where the chances of finding more dead bodies are very low,\\" said Captain Tazul Islam. The site will be handed over to the district administration on Tuesday on completion of salvage work, according to army spokesman Shahinul Islam. Reshma Begum, 19, a Bangladeshi woman who spent 17 days buried alive under factory rubble until her dramatic rescue on Friday, made her first public appearance on Monday and said she drew on mental fortitude to survive. \\"After ... much time I regained my senses and heard several voices (of other victims) around me who cried out and said please give me water ... I replied where shall I get water? I could not see anything as it was dark everywhere,\\" Begum said. She said she eventually managed to find a packet of biscuits which she ate as well as two bottles of water that helped slake her terrible thirst. \\"After that there was nothing to eat.\\" She said she could hear many other victims weeping under the wreckage. \\"But I did not fear. I don't know where I got so much mental strength. I never thought that I could survive. It is the almighty Allah who saved me,\\" said Begum, who doctors said has been recovering from acute dehydration. The cabinet approved an amendment to Bangladesh's labor laws on Monday, paving the way for parliament to allow garment workers to form unions without prior employer approval to help improve their job conditions, especially safety standards. International labor and human rights groups had long campaigned for workers to be able to form establish unions without such approval. The amendment was endorsed a day after the government decided to form a wage board to consider pay increases for readymade garment workers. Average monthly minimum wages now stand at the equivalent of 38 after an increase of about 80 percent in 2010 in response to months of violent street protests. UNREST TRIGGERS FACTORY CLOSURES Worker unrest prompted authorities to shut down more than 300 garment factories for indefinite periods in the Ashulia industrial belt, on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, that accounts for nearly 20 percent of total exports. \\"Owners decided to close their factories on safety grounds after workers went on a rampage almost every day after the collapse of Rana Plaza,\\" said Mohammad Atiqul Islam, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Eight people were killed in a fire at a factory last week that an industry association said may have been arson. About 2,500 people were rescued from the Rana Plaza, in Savar, a commercial suburb of Dhaka, after the April 24 collapse. Many survivors suffered serious injuries. The disaster, believed to have been triggered when generators were started up during a blackout, has raised questions about the use by Western retailers of the impoverished South Asian nation as a source of cheap goods. Nine people have been arrested in connection with the disaster, including the building's owner and bosses of the factories it housed. The government has accused the owners and builders of the eight-storey complex of using shoddy building materials, including substandard rods, bricks and cement, and of not obtaining the necessary clearances. Bangladesh's garment industry accounts for 80 percent of its exports. Low wages have helped lift Bangladesh to number two in the global ranking of exporters, behind China. Bangladesh ranked last in minimum wages for factory workers in 2010, according to World Bank data, behind Cambodia. (Editing by Mark Heinrich) ||||| Three weeks after a building collapse in Bangladesh that killed more than 1,100 workers, several of the world’s largest apparel companies – including the retailing giant H&M and Inditex, owner of the Zara chain — agreed on Monday to sign a far-reaching and legally binding plan that requires retailers to help finance fire safety and building improvements in the factories they use in Bangladesh. Consumer and labor groups hailed the move by Sweden-based H&M – which is the largest purchaser of garments from Bangladesh – as an important step toward improving factory safety in Bangladesh, saying it would increase pressure on other Western retailers and apparel brands to do likewise. Within hours of H&M's Monday statement, C&A of the Netherlands and two British retailers, Primark and Tesco, also joined in. The factory safety agreement calls for independent, rigorous factory safety inspections with public reports and mandatory repairs and renovations underwritten by Western retailers. A legally enforceable contract, it also calls for retailers to stop doing business with any factory that refuses to make necessary safety improvements, and for workers and their unions to have a substantial voice in factory safety. ||||| Hundreds of factories which form the hub of Bangladesh's garment industry are to close indefinitely after worker unrest sparked by the death of more than 1,100 colleagues, employees announced Monday. As the search for bodies from last month's collapse of a factory complex wrapped up, the textile industry's main trade body said all operations at the nearby Ashulia industrial zone were being suspended until further notice. Shahidullah Azim, of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said the decision to shut down all the factories at Ashulia, on the outskirts of Dhaka, was made \\"to ensure the security of our factories\\". Local police chief Badrul Alam told AFP that workers in 80 percent of the factories had walked out earlier in the day to demand an increase in salaries as well as the execution of the owner of the collapsed Rana Plaza complex in the town of Savar. Most of Bangladesh's top garment factories are based at Ashulia and there has been \\"virtually no work\\" there since the April 24 Rana Plaza tragedy, Azim said. Tensions in Ashulia had been further inflamed by the discovery of a dead female garment worker on Sunday. Police said they suspect that the death was a suicide sparked by a \\"love affair\\". Ashulia is home to around 500 factories which make clothing for a string of major Western retailers including Walmart, H&M, Tesco and Carrefour. News of the indefinite closure represents yet another body blow to the industry which has pleaded with Western retailers not to pull out of Bangladesh and promised to come up with a credible safety framework. The collapse of the nine-storey Rana Plaza, which housed five separate garment factories, was the worst industrial disaster in Bangladeshi history and the latest in a long line of deadly tragedies to blight the textile industry. A fire at a garment factory in Dhaka last November killed 111 workers and a blaze at another plant killed eight people last week. Bangladesh's army announced Monday that it was wrapping up its search for bodies at Savar, saying it now believed a total of 1,127 people were killed. The army general in charge of the marathon recovery effort said that he was now handing over operational control to civilian administrators and expected his troops to be back in their barracks by Tuesday afternoon. \\"The army's recovery operation is almost over,\\" Brigadier General Siddiqul Alam told AFP. \\"We're in the process of handing over the site to the district administration and we'll leave for our cantonment by 2:00pm tomorrow. \\"We don't think there are any more bodies in the rubble.\\" Many of the three million employed in the industry earn a basic 40 dollars a month, a wage condemned as \\"slave labour\\" by Pope Francis. Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi micro-loan pioneer who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, on Monday urged manufacturers and Western retailers to ensure that garment workers are paid a living wage. \\"We don't want to make Bangladesh a country of slaves. We want to make it a country of modern women. We want to make sure that they get rightful salaries from the world. It's in our hands,\\" he said in Dhaka. Bangladesh is the world's second-largest apparel maker and the 20 billion industry accounted for up to 80 percent of annual exports last year. Some activists have said that wages are kept low as trade unions have been hamstrung by government restrictions. However the Bangladeshi government on Monday approved changes in the labour laws that would make it easier for trade unions to organise themselves. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's cabinet \\"approved some amendments to the labour laws that removed the barriers,\\" cabinet secretary Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan told AFP. Authorities also said they had filed criminal cases against at least 177 garment factories after they failed to ensure safety measures. The government's chief factory inspector Habibul Islam told AFP that his department filed cases against 161 garment factories in the Dhaka region and 16 against plants based in the city of Chittagong. \\"We first issued notices against them to fix their safety related problems at their plants. Then we filed cases against them under the country's labour laws after they failed to respond to the our notices,\\" Islam said. The factory owners face a maximum three months in jail if they're found guilty, he said. Many of the criminal notices predate the Rana Plaza disaster and previous government crackdowns have resulted in few actual prosecutions. sa-co/lm |||||","completion":"A long time ago, in 2013, a building called Rana Plaza in Bangladesh collapsed.

What is the answer?","completion":"The Nobel prize-winning British playwright you are referring to who died in December 2008 is Harold Pinter. Harold Pinter was born on October 10, 1930, in London, England, and passed away on December 24, 2008, after a long battle with liver cancer. Harold Pinter was a celebrated playwright, screenwriter, director, and actor. He is best known for his work in the theatre, where his plays are marked by a unique style, featuring minimalistic dialogue, understated and enigmatic characters, and a signature use of pauses and silences, which is often referred to as the \\"Pinteresque\\" style. Some of his best-known and most influential works include \\"The Birthday Party,\\" \\"The Caretaker,\\" \\"The Homecoming,\\" and \\"Betrayal.\\" Over his career, Pinter wrote more than 30 plays and numerous screenplays for both film and television, including adaptations of his own stage works and novels by other authors. He also directed various stage productions and worked as an actor in theatre, films, and television. In addition to the Nobel Prize in Literature, which he was awarded in 2005, Pinter received numerous other prestigious awards and honors for his work, including the Laurence Olivier Award, PEN International Award, and the BAFTA Fellowship. He was also a recipient of the Golden PEN Award, which is given to a writer for their outstanding contribution to world literature. In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, Pinter was eloquent and outspoken about the state of human rights, the relationship between art and politics, and the role of an artist in society. Despite his declining health, he continued to work on his artistic pursuits until shortly before his death in December 2008. Today, Harold Pinter remains an enduring figure in the world of theatre, and his inimitable writing and style continue to influence and inspire playwrights, actors, and directors around the globe."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The US rock band had to pull out of their headline slot after Dave Grohl fractured his leg in a stage fall. It's not the first time the festival has had to book a last minute replacement - U2, the Stone Roses and Kylie Minogue have all cancelled appearances due to illness or injury. It's almost as if the Pyramid Stage is cursed... But who is likely to step in for the Foo Fighters on 26 June? Already on the bill, and basking in the afterglow of their third number one album, Florence and the Machine are the most likely choice. Proven festival headliners with a set of earthy, mystical songs they fit neatly with the Glastonbury ethos. Hits like Kiss With A Fist and Shake It Up will sound perfect as the sun sets in Somerset, and their promotion up the bill would help settle a gender imbalance. But singer Florence Welch should be wary of the curse of the Pyramid Stage - she broke her foot while playing Coachella in April. Never bad at Glastonbury, the Britpop survivors played the gig of their lifetime at the 2009 festival. The set was so emotional, Damon Albarn even broke into tears after To The End. A brilliant new album, The Magic Whip, would stop a 2015 set being a repeat performance with songs like Ong Ong and Lonesome Street going down particularly well at the Isle of Wight Festival last weekend. Albarn also has form in helping Glastonbury out of a crisis - he brought his animated hip-hop collective Gorillaz to the main stage when U2 dropped out in 2010. Although it was a poorly received set. A natural substitute for the hard-rocking riffage of the Foo Fighters, AC/DC were widely rumoured to be in the frame for Glastonbury earlier this year. But the band poured cold water on the story, with frontman Brian Johnson describing the festival as \\"wellies and corporate\\". But after hearing Metallica had played in 2014, their attitude softened. \\"If they askâ€¦ OK,\\" said guitarist Angus Young. Detractors say the band has been writing the same exact song over and over for years - but it's a pretty good song, and Glastonbury would be a perfect place to air Highway to Hell and Back in Black. Luckily, they're between dates on their European tour on 26 June. Emily Eavis probably has Chris Martin on speed dial. The band are a reliable Glastonbury stalwart, with anthems aplenty. Glastonbury also gave the band a considerable leg up in 2005, when they were booked to lead the Pyramid Stage while still relatively untested. Nevertheless, they were the talk of the festival afterwards, thanks to a particularly heartfelt rendition of The Scientist. A headline slot would give fans a rare chance to hear last year's well-received Ghost Stories album live - the group only played two UK dates on their brief world tour. But they might want to hold fire until next year. Chris Martin has hinted the band's seventh studio album could be their swansong. Assuming Dave Grohl, the nicest man in rock, doesn't want to leave Glastonbury in the lurch, he could put in a call to his good friends Queens of the Stone Age. Josh Homme's band played a blistering headline set on Glastonbury's Other Stage in 2013, drawing a sizeable crowd despite being scheduled against Beyonce. They're currently in the recording studio, but have scheduled to play Rock in Rio this September, which means they could be battle ready. A popular suggestion on social media, Swift is certainly riding a wave this year, thanks to the unassailable pop of her new album 1989. Handily, she's in the UK next week and has Friday night off before playing the BST festival in Hyde Park the following day. But it's been a long time since Glastonbury booked such an unashamedly commercial act as its headliner - and while the crowd would undoubtedly lap up Shake It Off and Blank Space, they might find the country elements of her set unpalatable. Maybe she could win the crowd over with a headbanging cover the Foo Fighters' Best of You? Every year, a rumour sweeps around Glastonbury that Daft Punk are \\"definitely\\" playing a secret set over the weekend. Why should this year be any different? See above. He's been listed as a potential headliner for years, and at one point looked set to sign up for 2015. For whatever reason, negotiations fell apart but a last-minute booking would suit the star's hit-and-run philosophy. If the Minneapolis musician did pop, it would undoubtedly go down as one of Glastonbury's legendary performances. He's at the top of his game, thanks to his muscular, perfectly-drilled new band 3rd Eye Girl - and, as he's fond of telling audiences: \\"I got so many hits we don't have time to play 'em all.\\" But even just the staples of his set - Raspberry Beret, Purple Rain, Let's Go Crazy, Kiss, Little Red Corvette - would be the envy of any headliner. The Chain, Don't Stop, Tusk, Black Magic Woman - Fleetwood Mac have no shortage of hits to supply to the Pyramid Stage. But, it seems, they're not that keen on travelling down to Somerset. Their Isle Of Wight set last weekend was billed as a \\"worldwide festival exclusive\\", and organiser John Giddings claimed Glastonbury bosses were green with envy. \\"Michael Eavis said, 'How did you get Fleetwood Mac?' I said, 'I paid them!'\\" he told Music Week. If the band were to capitulate, though, they'd have to cancel or postpone a show at London's O2 Arena, which is booked for the same night. Muse last headlined Glastonbury in 2010, welcoming The Edge on stage in the year that U2 were forced to pull out. Their star has waned in the intervening years (with the critics, at least) but they are still a thrilling, compelling live act. On their new album, Drones, they've ditched the frilly faux-operatics of their more recent work in favour of proto-metal riffs and Matt Bellamy's soaring vocals. The opportunity to hear Knights of Cydonia charging over the fields of Worthy Farm again is not one to be be missed - but there's one small problem. They're already headlining the Bravalla Festival in Sweden that night.

You might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers and German shepherds were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \\"Interestingly, there are indications that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age. The study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \\"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically close to humans,\\" said Hannes Lohi, leader... A:","completion":"Which of the following factors is associated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in dogs based on the article? A. Breed of the dog B. Early separation from their mothers C.

However, it could not be replicated. No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results. If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research, the truth might never have come out. You can read more about this case at the URL below. and the situation: John works for the NSF. He has two research proposals in front of him, case A and case B. Both are looking for further funding. Case A research has been replicated by other researchers, but case B research could not be replicated by others. He needs to decide which research should get further funding. Answer the following question: In which case the scientist would have more likely committed a fraud, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In case B, the scientist would have more likely committed a fraud. This is because the research in case B could not be replicated by others, which raises concerns about the validity of the results. In contrast, the research in case A was replicated by other researchers, indicating that the results and methods are more likely to be valid and reliable. Just like the example given in the background, failure to replicate results can be a warning sign of potential fraud or incorrect findings. Thus, John should be cautious when considering funding for case B and pursue further investigation into the reasons behind the lack of replication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While attending the funeral of his father, Melvin Devereux (John Savage), meets a beautiful young woman (Sandi Schultz) who addresses him by name, although he cannot remember having met her before. After an enigmatic exchange of casual words, Devereux drives away, motoring aimlessly around New Orleans. Devereux decides to ignore warning barriers and drives onto a closed freeway. But the police follow him and he is forced to turn aside. His car breaks down in a decapitated area of the city. But the mysterious young woman again appears, suggesting that he try a mechanic located nearby to fix his car. After helping Devereux push his car to the garage, the young woman again refuses to explain how she knows him or tell him her name. While waiting, the woman suggests they go to a motel nearby, apparently for sex. After checking into a room, and getting ready in the bathroom, Devereux exits and discovers that she is gone, leaving behind a message written on a mirror in red lipstick which says that the time is not yet right.Having collected his repaired vehicle, Devereux encounters a hearse driving on the road ahead. When he attempts to overtake it, the driver (Richard Castleman) deliberately swerves to prevent him. Turning off onto more treacherous country roads, Devereux nearly gets stranded when his car gets stuck in muddy terrain, and he barely negotiates a rickety wooden bridge.At last finding his way back to the main road, he stops off at a local roadside bar for a drink where the hearse is also parked outside. In a drunken altercation, Deveveux challenges the driver to reveal whose body he is transporting. The folded ribbon adorning the casket seen inside the hearse bears a name tantalizingly similar to Devereux's own. The confused, now frightened man follows the hearse to a church where an all-black congregation is mourning at another funeral.

Glenn Lee Beck (born February 10, 1964) is an American talk show host, political commentator, and producer. He is the CEO, founder, and owner of Mercury Radio Arts, the parent company of his television and radio network TheBlaze. A conservative, he hosts the Glenn Beck Radio Program, a popular talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the Glenn Beck television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on the Fox News Channel and currently airs on TheBlaze. In 1983 he moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, to work at radio station KZFM. In mid-1985, Beck was hired away from KZFM to be the lead DJ for the morning-drive radio broadcast by WRKA in Louisville, Kentucky. His four-hour weekday show was called Captain Beck and the A-Team. Beck had a reputation as a \\"young up-and-comer\\". The show was not political and included the usual off-color antics of the genre: juvenile jokes, pranks, and impersonations. The show slipped to third in the market and Beck left abruptly in 1987 amid a dispute with WRKA management. Months later, Beck was hired by Phoenix Top-40 station KOY-FM, then known as Y-95. Beck was partnered with Arizona native Tim Hattrick to co-host a local \\"morning zoo\\" program. During his time at Y-95, Beck cultivated a rivalry with local pop radio station KZZP and that station's morning host Bruce Kelly. Through practical jokes and publicity stunts, Beck drew criticism from the staff at Y-95 when the rivalry culminated in Beck telephoning Kelly's wife on-the-air, mocking her recent miscarriage. In 1989, Beck resigned from Y-95 to accept a job in Houston at KRBE, known as Power 104. Beck was subsequently fired in 1990 due to poor ratings. Beck then moved on to Baltimore, Maryland, and the city's leading Top-40 station, WBSB, known as B104. There, he partnered with Pat Gray, a morning DJ. During his tenure at B104, Beck was arrested and jailed for speeding in his DeLorean. According to a former associate, Beck was \\"completely out of it\\" when a station manager went to bail him out. When Gray, then Beck were fired, the two men spent six months in Baltimore, planning their next move. In early 1992, Beck and Gray both moved to WKCI-FM (KC101), a Top-40 radio station in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1995, WKCI apologized after Beck and Gray mocked a Chinese-American caller on air who felt offended by a comedy segment by playing a gong sound effect and having executive producer Alf Gagineau mock a Chinese accent. That incident led to protests by activist groups. When Gray left the show to move to Salt Lake City, Beck continued with co-host Vinnie Penn. At the end of 1998, Beck was informed that his contract would not be renewed at the end of 1999. The Glenn Beck Program first aired in 2000 on WFLA (AM) in Tampa, and took their afternoon time slot from eighteenth to first place within a year. In January 2002, Premiere Radio Networks launched the show nationwide on 47 stations. The show then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, broadcasting from new flagship station WPHT. On November 5, 2007, The New York Times reported that Premiere Radio Networks was extending Beck's contract. By May 2008, it had reached over 280 terrestrial stations as well as XM Satellite. It was ranked 4th in the nation with over six and a half million listeners. As of July 2013, Beck was tied for number four in the ratings behind Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Dave Ramsey.","completion":"This text is about Glenn Lee Beck, an American talk show host, political commentator, and producer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, she takes a job performing with a traveling vaudeville troupe, where she meets and falls in love with singer-dancer Frank Burt. Frank proposes they marry and also entertain on stage together as an act, which proves very popular. Myrtle retires from show business after giving birth to daughters Iris and Mikie, while her husband goes on tour with another partner. A few years later, less successful now, Frank persuades his wife to return to the stage. The girls are cared for by their grandmother as their parents leave town for months at a time. Iris and Mikie are school girls when they are given a trip to Boston to see their parents. Iris meets a well-to-do young man, Bob Clarkman, and is permitted to attend an exclusive boarding school there. She is embarrassed by her parents' profession, however, and mortified at what the reaction will be from Bob and all of her new school friends when they learn that her parents are performing nearby. Myrtle and Frank take matters into their own hands, arranging with the school to have all of the students attend a show.

Imagine you have 959 red (negative) blocks and 1080 green (positive) blocks. You take away 959 red blocks, then you are left with a difference of blocks. Since there are more green (positive) blocks, we calculate the difference between the two numbers: 1080 - 959 = 121. Since there are more green blocks, our answer is positive. So, -959 + 1080 = 121. Now, our equation is: 121 = -11 * z. To solve for z, we need to undo the multiplication by -11. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -11. So, 121 / -11 = z. When we divide 121 by -11, our answer is -11 (since a positive number divided by a negative number results in a negative number).

Write a question about the following article: In early 1701, Louis registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris Parlement, raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, the Spanish-controlled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy announced their support for Philip and accepted French troops. Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore. At the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally Max Emanuel of Bavaria. This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of Münster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will. In response, Leopold, the Dutch Republic and Britain signed the Treaty of The Hague on 7 September 1701 renewing the 1689 Grand Alliance. Provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier in the Spanish Netherlands, the Protestant succession in England and Scotland and an independent Spain but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne. When the Stuart exile James II died on 16 September, Louis reneged on his commitment at Ryswick to recognise William as King by proclaiming James Francis Edward King of England and Scotland. The vast majority in Britain now supported war and after William's death on 19 March 1702, Queen Anne announced the continuation of his policies ie ensuring the Protestant succession and resisting French expansion.

A restaurant has kicked out a customer who refused to take off his Google Glass.

But he refused to take them off and was eventually asked to leave - sparking an online spat between Starr and the restaurant, and raising the debate about how invasive the gadget is. Complaining about the incident on his Facebook page, Starr explained that he and his boyfriend were at the cafe and looking at the menus when a manager approached them, KIRO reported. Scroll down for video. Dispute: Nick Starr left a Seattle restaurant after he was ordered to remove his Google Glass, pictured. 'She tells me that. the owner's other restaurant doesn't allow Google Glass and that I would. have to either put it away or leave,' he wrote. 'I... asked to see where it was policy for Glass to be disallowed at Lost. Lake. She said she couldn't provide any and when asked to speak with. management she stated she was the night manager.' Refusing to remove the glasses, Starr and his boyfriend left. He vented on his Facebook post, demanding an apology from the restaurant and calling for the woman's termination. He added that he thought it was bizarre that the restaurant asked customers to shares images on social networking sites of their experiences there, but banned the Glass. Scene: The manager at the Lost Lake Cafe asked him to remove the glasses in accordance with their policy. Anger: Restaurant owner David Meinert, pictured, said he thought the glasses were invasive. But the Lost Lake Cafe has refused to apologize, saying that they have other customers' interests in mind. They shot back at Starr with their own Facebook post, outlining its policy. 'We recently had to ask a rude. customer to leave because of their insistence on wearing and operating. Google Glasses inside the restaurant,' the statement said. 'We. kindly ask our customers to refrain from wearing and operating Google. Glasses inside Lost Lake. We also ask that you not videotape anyone. using any other sort of technology.

Night out: Starr was out with his boyfriend, Brian (left), when they were approached by the manager. Fan: Starr said he wears the glasses everywhere and argued you can also take pictures with cell phones.

'I think they're invasive and they make people uncomfortable,' he told KOMO News. 'More than that they make me uncomfortable, and it's my place.' But Starr countered that he believes Google Glass is no more intrusive than cell phones with cameras that are also capable of taking images. 'I think privacy is vapor now,' Starr said. 'There are cameras everywhere. There are recording devices everywhere.' See below for video.

British scientists found no difference in the rate of live babies born whether the man was in his 40s or 20s. Women were slightly more likely to have a baby if the sperm was donated by a middle-aged man rather than a younger donor. A quarter of sperm used in UK clinics comes from abroad, namely Denmark. Study carried out at Newcastle Fertility Centre found sperm quality rather than a man's age is key to conceiving. Experts said it could be down to the fact older donors are more likely to have families of their own and therefore a proven fertility track record. Article:","completion":"Title: Male Age and Fertility: A Groundbreaking Study Dispels Age-related Myths Introduction For years, there has been significant focus on the impact of a woman's age on fertility, with the biological clock often cited as a primary concern. However, far less attention has been paid to the effect of male age on fertility and conception rates. A recent groundbreaking study conducted by British scientists at Newcastle Fertility Centre has shed light on this issue, dispelling common myths surrounding the link between age and male fertility. Major Study on Male Age and Fertility The first major study of its kind, the research conducted by British scientists investigated the effect of male age on fertility, specifically focusing on the rate of live babies born. The results provided compelling evidence that there was no significant difference in the rate of live babies born to men in their 40s compared to their counterparts in their 20s. Furthermore, the study found that women were slightly more likely to have a baby if the sperm was donated by a middle-aged man rather than a younger donor. This interesting discovery highlights the fact that sperm quality – not a man's age – is the key factor when it comes to conceiving a child. Sperm Donation in the UK The study's findings are particularly relevant to the United Kingdom, where a quarter of the sperm used in fertility clinics is sourced from abroad, with Denmark being a major contributor. The reliance on foreign sperm donors has often raised concerns about the impact of age on sperm quality. However, the findings of this study suggest that age may not be as significant a factor as previously thought. Older Donors and Fertility Track Record One possible explanation for the slightly higher likelihood of women having a baby using sperm from middle-aged men is that older donors are more likely to have families of their own, showcasing a proven fertility track record. This suggests that the quality of sperm is at least partially shaped by factors beyond the age of the male donor, such as their overall health, lifestyle choices and genetic makeup. Implications and Conclusion The groundbreaking study conducted by Newcastle Fertility Centre has significant implications for prospective parents as well as fertility clinics and sperm banks. By debunking the myth that male age is a critical factor for fertility, this research allows both individuals and professionals to focus on more crucial aspects such as sperm quality and overall health when considering conception. In conclusion, the findings offer a fresh perspective on male fertility and emphasize the importance of looking beyond age when evaluating a man's ability to father a child. The study serves as a reminder that fertility is a complex matter influenced by a range of factors, and ultimately, that a man's age may not be as critical as once believed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device First-half goals from Paul Robinson, Dean Parrett and Poleon effectively ended the tie as a contest. The hosts continued to impress after the break, dominating a disjointed Bury backline and adding to their lead through Poleon and Lyle Taylor. Robinson slammed the Dons in front on 27 minutes, converting Taylor's deft low cross from close range. They doubled their lead five minutes later as Parrett sidefooted past goalkeeper Ben Williams after a mix-up in the Bury defence. The visitors' defending was poor and they conceded a third in first-half stoppage time, Robinson unselfishly sliding in Poleon for the third. AFC Wimbledon - who were without a win in four matches previously - were producing some excellent football in front of their home crowd and Poleon underlined their dominance by getting his second and the home side's fourth goal on 72 minutes. The impressive Taylor then added his name to the scoresheet by ripping a powerful shot into the far corner 10 minutes from time. The result piles more misery on the visitors, who have not won in their last 11 games in all competitions. Report supplied by the Press Association Match ends, AFC Wimbledon 5, Bury 0.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Which works require three voices including a narrator? , can you please find it? (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy... Answer:","completion":"The works that require three voices, including a narrator, are Il combattimento and Armida abbandonata. Both of these works are mentioned in the provided text and exhibit structural similarities to one another."},{"prompt":"Information: - Flapper Filosofy ( sometimes called Flapper Filosophy ) was a newspaper comic panel distributed by King Features Syndicate and the O'Dell Newspaper Service . It ran during the flapper era of the 1920s into the early 1930s . The art was by Faith Burrows . Each panel exhibited a flapper wearing one of the current fashions , with a witticism typed at the bottom . Burrows drew her panels at an image size of 3 \`\` × 6 '' on Bristol boards measuring 3 \`\` × 6 '' . Burrows ' series ran in competition for a time with Ethel Hays ' similarly themed and well - established Flapper Fanny Says panel from NEA . As writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Anita Loos , and illustrators such as Burrows , Hays , Russell Patterson and John Held Jr. popularized the flapper look and lifestyle through their works , flappers came to be seen as attractive , reckless and independent . - Faith Swank Burrows (November 17, 1904 April 11, 1997) was a nationally syndicated cartoonist during the Jazz Age. - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties. - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes. - An editorial cartoon, also known as a political cartoon, is an illustration containing a commentary that usually relates to current events or personalities. An artist who draws such images is known as an editorial cartoonist. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Flappers were a generation of young Western women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles, and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms. Flappers had their origins in the liberal period of the Roaring Twenties, the social, political turbulence and increased transatlantic cultural exchange that followed the end of World War I, as well as the export of American jazz culture to Europe. - The Roaring Twenties is a term for Western society and culture in the 1920s. It was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, particularly in major cities such as New York City, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit, Paris, Berlin, London and Los Angeles. In France and Quebec, it was known as the \\"\\"années folles\\"\\" (\\"Crazy Years\\"), emphasizing the era's social, artistic and cultural dynamism. Jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked, and, in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism after World War I, normalcy returned to politics. This era saw the large-scale use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio, and electricity; commercial, passenger, and freight aviation; as well as unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand, plus significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums. In most major democracies, women won the right to vote. - Print syndication distributes news articles, columns, comic strips and other features to newspapers, magazines and websites. They offer reprint rights and grant permissions to other parties for republishing content of which they own/represent copyrights. - King Features Syndicate, Inc. is a print syndication company owned by The Hearst Corporation that distributes about 150 comic strips, newspaper columns, editorial cartoons, puzzles and games to nearly 5,000 newspapers worldwide.

In a puzzle, one is required to put pieces together in a logical way, in order to arrive at the correct solution of the puzzle. There are different types of puzzles for different ages, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, or logic puzzles. - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.

Speaking before Sunday's road race, a tearful Armitstead told BBC Sport she would \\"never cheat in life\\". \\"In this situation I'm never going to win. If I win, people will say it's because of something else,\\" she added. The Yorkshire rider, who won a silver medal at London 2012, is among the favourites to triumph in Rio after winning a Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) appeal. She had her first missed test rescinded after Cas ruled the doping official \\"didn't do what was reasonable and necessary\\" to find her. Armitstead says she was \\"in the place where I should have been\\" and points out she gave a negative test the following day at the UCI Women Road World Cup. The second strike, relating to an inconsistency on a form over her whereabouts, was a \\"stupid mistake\\" which came shortly after she became world champion last year. She would not discuss the \\"traumatic\\" family circumstances which led to missing the third test earlier this year.

(H). animals. You are presented with the quiz \\"what are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates\\" and \\"penguins are a type of birds\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","completion":"The term \\"endothermic tetrapod vertebrates\\" is a scientific description of a group of animals. Let's break the term down: - Endothermic refers to an organism's ability to regulate its own body temperature by internal means. In simple terms, it means the organism is warm-blooded. - Tetrapod means four-legged. However, in scientific nomenclature, it refers to animals that are descendants from four-legged ancestors, even if they have evolved to have fewer limbs (like snakes or birds). - Vertebrate refers to having a backbone or spinal column. So, an endothermic tetrapod vertebrate is a warm-blooded animal that descends from four-legged ancestors and has a backbone. The teacher gave two hints: \\"Birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates\\" and \\"Penguins are a type of birds\\". Therefore, based on these hints, we can specifically identify that penguins (option D) fit into the category of endothermic tetrapod vertebrates. To summarize, the term \\"endothermic tetrapod vertebrates\\" is a broad category that includes many animals. Mammals (option A) and humans (option C) also fit into this category because they are warm-bloodd (option F), have a backbone, and are descendant from four-legged ancestors. However, with the given hints by the teacher, the best answer to this question is penguins (option D) because they are birds (also endothermic tetrapod vertebrates) and the statement directly specifies them. Also, it's worth noting that though jellyfish (option E) are animals (option H) they are not endothermic, not tetrapods, and not vertebrates. They are marine invertebrates. Clouds (option B) are not relevant to the question as they are not a biological entity. So, the correct answer to the question \\"what are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates?\\" given the hints by the teacher would be D. Penguins."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has... Question: How long did it take for Comey to write his book?

A password is considered strong if (a) it has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters; (b) it contains at least one lowercase letter and one uppercase letter, and at least one digit; (c) it does not contain three repeating characters in a row. In one step you can: (1) Insert one character to password, (2) delete one character from password, or (3) replace one character of password with another character. Input: password = LBdHc8p3RwkHLUukWvfMqwSZ.kXt3KK5nwenQu Output:","completion":"The task is asking you to take a given password and modify it so that it meets certain criteria of a strong password. So, the guidelines that it gives are: 1. The password has to be at least 6 characters long and at most 20 characters long. 2. It needs to contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit. 3. It cannot have three repeating characters in a row. The task also mentions three operations you can perform on the password, each operation counts as a step: 1. Insert one character into the password. 2. Delete one character from the password. 3. Replace one character in the password with another character. Now, let's use these guidelines to come up with a strategy to finish the task: 1. Start by checking the length of the password. If its length is less than 6 or more than 20, you'll need to add or delete characters respectively. 2. Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. If it does not meet these criteria, you'll need to replace some characters. 3. Finally, scan through the password to identify any instances where a character is repeated three times in a row. Each instance will require a replacement operation. The output of the task is the total number of steps required to convert the given password into a strong password. For the given task: password = LBdHc8p3RwkHLUukWvfMqwSZ.kXt3KK5nwenQu It's easy to see that the password is way longer than 20 characters, it has all the types of characters needed - uppercase, lowercase, and a digit, and contains three repeating characters 'uuu'. So we need to delete or replace the excess characters (length 41 - max length 20) and replace one of 'u' in 'uuu'. Therefore, the steps would equal to number of excess characters. In this case, I count 21 steps - 20 to delete the excessive characters and 1 to replace one 'u' from the three 'u's. So the output of the task is: 21"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Researchers at the University of Bristol have developed and started studying a novel concept in robotics--intelligent handheld robots. Historically, handheld tools have been straight, unintelligent instruments that are _ of the context they operate in, are fully directed by the user, and therefore, lack any understanding about the task they are performing. Dr. Walterio Mayol-Cuevas and PhD student, Austin Gregg-Smith, from the University's Department of Computer Science, have been working in the design of the robot as well as in understanding how best to be with a tool that \\"knows and acts\\". Compared to other tools such as power tools that have a motor and perhaps some basic sensors , the handheld robots developed at Bristol are designed to have more degrees of freedom to allow greater independence from the instructions of the user, and importantly, understand the steps being carried out. This allows for a new level of co-operation between user and tool, such as the user providing directions and the tool performing the detailed task. Handheld robots, aim to share physical similarity with users but are neither fully independent as is a humanoid robot nor are part of the user's body. The aim with handheld robots is to develop the intuitiveness of using traditional handheld tools while adding planted intelligence and action to allow for new abilities. Dr. Mayol-Cuevas, Reader in Robotics Computer Vision and Mobile Systems, said, \\"There are three basic levels of autonomy we are considering: no autonomy, semi-autonomous when the robot advises the user but does not act, and fully autonomous when the robot advises and acts even by correcting or refusing to perform incorrect user actions.\\" Question: What can we learn from the passage? Options: A: The handheld robots can never disobey the user's order. B: The autonomy is the only thing that the scientists are considering.

Jemel Roberson, 26, was shot dead by a Midlothian police officer responding to a shooting inside Manny’s Blue Room Bar in Robbins, Illinois, about 4 a.m. Sunday. Witnesses said officers shot at the wrong man. \\"Everybody was screaming out, 'Security!' He was a security guard,\\" witness Adam Harris said. \\"And they still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him.\\" It all began when security asked a group of drunken men to leave Manny's shortly before 4 a.m. Sunday. Witnesses said someone came back with a gun and opened fire. Security returned fire, witnesses said, and Roberson was able to detain one of the men involved outside. \\"He had somebody on the ground with his knee in back, with his gun in his back, like, 'Don’t move,'\\" Harris said. Soon after, according to witnesses, an officer responding to the scene shot at Roberson — killing him.

In a statement, Midlothian police confirmed two officers from the department responded to the scene of the shooting and that one of them opened fire. \\"A Midlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer-involved shooting. The subject the officer shot was later pronounced deceased at an area hospital,\\" Chief Daniel Delaney of the Midlothian Police Department said in a statement. Friends said Roberson was an upstanding guy who had plans to become a police officer. He was also a musician, playing keyboard and drums at several Chicago-area churches. \\"Every artist he’s ever played for, every musician he’s ever sat beside, we’re all just broken because we have no answers,\\" the Rev.

LeAundre Hill said. The Cook County Sheriff's Office is handling the criminal investigation of the original shooting, while the State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the police-involved shooting. Roberson's family said in addition to the holding the officer who shot him responsible, his family wants Roberson to be remembered as a hero. His family and friends believe there was a racial element to the situation because the cop who shot him was white. Law enforcement has not confirmed the race of the officer.

Lawyers for Roberson’s family said Tuesday night that he was the father of a 9-month old son named Tristan. The child’s mother, Avontea Boose, is currently pregnant with their their second child, according to a statement from Merritt Law Office. Meanwhile, Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delany changed his description of Roberson on Tuesday, at first describing him as a “subject with a gun” and later referring to him as “a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny’s Blue Room.” Delany initially said “there were conflicting reports of whether he was the suspect or a security guard” in the Sunday morning shooting. But it’s now known that Roberson was attempting to diffuse a shooting situation that had broken out in the bar. An attorney representing Roberson’s family has also said Roberson was doing his job when he apprehended a shooting suspect when Midlothian police arrived on the scene. The still-unnamed officer fired shots, striking and killing Roberson. Demonstrators gathered Tuesday in front of the police department, calling for “Justice for Jemel” and asking for a thorough investigation. “We won’t get justice tomorrow–we won’t get justice today,” Roberson’s friend Stringer Harris said. Roberson’s attorney says Roberson was wearing a hat and shirt with the word “security” on both items of clothing at the time of the shooting. A photo taken in September shows Roberson in a security shirt, and a friend told CBS 2 he would have typically worn the ensemble to a shift at the night club. Midlothian police did not respond to a request from CBS 2 for bodycam video. The officer involved is currently on paid administrative leave pending the results of a state investigation. ||||| (CNN) A suburban Chicago police officer responding to a shooting Sunday at a bar killed a security guard who was just \\"doing his job,\\" an attorney for the slain man's family said. An officer from Midlothian, Illinois, fatally shot Jemel Roberson, a 26-year-old security guard working at the bar, Cook County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Sophia Ansari told CNN. Law enforcement agencies responded to the shooting around 4 a.m. at Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins, about 20 miles south of Chicago, Ansari said. Three people and an alleged shooter were injured, she added. Then, after Roberson had apprehended an alleged gunman, the Midlothian officer shot Roberson outside the bar, according to a federal lawsuit filed Monday that calls the fatal shooting \\"excessive and unreasonable\\" and says it violated Roberson's civil rights. Witnesses said security had asked several drunk men to leave the bar, and at least one person returned and opened fire, CNN affiliate WGN reported. A bartender was among those victims, according to the lawsuit. After that shooting, Roberson \\"had somebody on the ground ... with his knee in back, with his gun in his back like, 'Don't move,' \\" Adam Harris, a witness, told WGN. The officer responding to the scene then fired at Roberson, the TV station reported, citing witnesses. \\"We all yelled. 'He's a security. He's a security,' and without ... giving any thought, they shot him,\\" Harris told the station . \\"The vest said security as well ... and they shot him in the side.\\" The Midlothian Police Department has asked the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force to investigate, which is department policy for an officer-involved shooting, according to Midlothian police Chief Daniel Delaney. In a statement, the Illinois State Police said its officials are investigating the shooting. It said that according to witness statements, \\"the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject.\\" It also said Roberson was in plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a security guard and armed with a gun. The department did not initially identify Roberson as a security guard because it immediately relinquished the investigation to the State Police and did not know his name or position at the time, Delaney said Tuesday. \\"What we have learned is Jemel Roberson was a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny's Blue Room,\\" Delaney wrote on Facebook. \\"The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel , his family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with.\\" The suspected gunman in the initial bar shooting is being treated at a local hospital and has not been charged, Ansari said. 'Jemel was trying to save people's lives' The lawsuit filed by Roberson's mother lists the unnamed Midlothian officer and the village of Midlothian as defendants. It seeks damages of more than 1 million. \\"Jemel was trying to save people's lives. He was working security because a shooting had just taken place in the establishment,\\" the family's attorney, Gregory Kulis, told CNN affiliate WLS \\"So, he was doing his job and holding on to somebody until ... police arrived,\\" Kulis said. \\"And a police officer, our feeling is, did not make the proper assessment and fired and killed Jemel.\\" Roberson had a Firearms Owners' Identification Card, which allows Illinois residents to legally possess firearms or ammunition, according to Ansari. Midlothian police confirmed that two of its officers responded to the bar shooting and one opened fire, WGN reported \\"A Midlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer-involved shooting. The subject the officer shot was later pronounced deceased at an area hospital,\\" Delaney said in an earlier statement. The officer involved in the shooting is a four-year veteran of the police department, WLS reported, citing Delaney. Karen Sheley, director of the Police Practices Project for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, suggested that Roberson's race influenced the decision to shoot. \\"Working as a security guard while Black should not be a death sentence. In this case, police were more dangerous to him than an active shooter who he apparently subdued,\\" Sheley said in a statement \\"The police killing of Mr. Roberson was avoidable. Here, a police officer's assumptions about Mr. Roberson, apparently impacted by bias, rather than a clear-headed assessment of the situation, resulted in a tragedy.\\" A church musician who wanted to be a cop Jemel Roberson is seen with his young son, who is now 9 months old. Roberson was the father to a 9-month-old son, and the boy's mother is expecting their second child, according to family attorney S. Lee Merritt. He was a gospel musician at several churches, according to according to WGN . Kulis said Roberson played the organ and was scheduled to perform at church on the Sunday morning he was killed. Roberson was also preparing to embark on a career as a police officer, WGN reported. Roberson had planned to take a police exam in March, according to Eric Russell, an activist. \\"The very people that he wanted to be family with took his life,\\" the Rev. Patricia Hill of Purposed Church said. Roberson's family members are \\"just distraught,\\" another pastor, the Rev. Walter Turner, said. \\"They are hurt, trying to find out answers, trying to figure out why did this have to happen,\\" Turner told the TV station. Loved ones and supporters held a vigil Monday night outside Manny's Blue Room Lounge, WGN reported. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The case involves the fatal shooting of Jemel Roberson, a 26-year-old security guard, by a Midlothian police officer while he was trying to detain a man involved in a shooting at Manny's Blue Room Bar in Robbins, Illinois. Prominent details shared were: the incident began when a group of drunken men were asked to leave the bar, after which one returned with a gun and opened fire; Roberson subdued and detained one of the men outside the bar; despite being identified as a security guard by witnesses, Roberson was shot by a police officer responding to the scene. The lawsuit was filed by Roberson's family against the officer who shot him and the city's police department, seeking damages in excess of 1 million. Witnesses, family, and friends narrated that Roberson was an upstanding individual with plans of a future career as a policeman and remembered him as a hero. The incident brought on sorrow and outrage, with many suggesting that racial bias influenced the tragedy. Official investigations are being conducted by the Cook County Sheriff's Office and the State Police Public Integrity Task Force."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence.

Context: Vinyl records can be warped by heat, improper storage, exposure to sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for it was part of the art of turntable and tonearm design. \\"wow\\" (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: You do not need every word to understand the meaning of what you read. In fact, too much emphasis on separate words both slows your speed and reduces your comprehension. First, any habit which slows down your silent reading to the speed at which you speak or read aloud, is inefficient. If you point to each word as you read, or move your head, or form the words with your lips, you read poorly. Less obvious habits also hold back reading efficiency . One is \\"saying\\" each word silently by moving your tongue or throat; another is \\"hearing\\" each word as you read. These are habits which should have been outgrown long ago. The beginning reader is learning how letters can make words, how written words are pronounced, and how sentences are put together. Your reading purpose is quite different, which is to understand meaning. It has been supposed that up to 75% of the words in English sentences are not really necessary for expressing the meaning. The secret of silent reading is to find out those key words and phrases which carry the thought, and to pay less attention to words which exist only for grammatical completeness. An efficient reader can grasp the meaning from a page at least twice as fast as he can read the page aloud. He takes in a whole phrase or thought unit at a time. If he \\"says\\" or \\"hears\\" words to himself, they are selected ones, said for emphasis. Question: This passage is mainly about _ .

All in the 'Tude? What do you think Jen Aniston could possibly see in John Mayer? He's been drinking too much koo-koo-kool-aid in my book. Doesn't that seem like an odd match? -- Submitted during last week's Celebritology Live discussion Koo-koo-Koolaid or not, 30-year-old John Mayer seems to have an almost Lance Armstrong-esque ability to attract his choice of A-list (okay, maybe B) lady loves: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jessica Simpson, Minka Kelly, among others. And, now, Hollywood untouchable Jennifer Aniston. Just last week, pictures of Mayer snogging with Aniston poolside in Miami hit the net with all the force of Brangelina baby bump shot. And not only is Mayer considered a jumbo-sized chick magnet, he apparently has the ability to love 'em and leave 'em, rendering his exes inconsolable: Last week, a drunken Jessica Simspon was rumored to have been removed from a Hollywood hotel bar on the same day the JenJohn (remember, you heard that portmanteau here first!) pix surfaced on the Web. Coincidence? Maybe. (Of course, Simpson's debauchery could also have been a reaction to rumors of a split from most recent boyfriend Tony Romo.) Is it, as pal Josh Groban says, Mayer's \\"swagger\\" and \\"'tude,\\" or something else that makes him such a catch? Mayer claims he's just a nice guy. \\"I don't have a secret,\\" Mayer recently told People. \\"I don't think about it like that. I think about it as just being nice. All you have to do is just be polite and treat people really well.\\" For the record, the date-ready Mayer has never taken any of his romantic relationships to the cohabitation level. According to Wikipedia, Mayer \\"splits his time between his home in the Los Angeles suburbs (with his roommate and sound engineer, Chad Franscoviak) and his apartment in the New York City neighborhood of SoHo.\\" Comment of the Week \\"I can't believe i finally have something in common with Gwyneth.

Posted by: Juicy | May 19, 2008 3:05 PM I guess nobody on this site is much of a music fan because John M. is a phenomenal musician. Eric Clapton was one of his mentors - the man is now close to SRV-legend territory. \\"Wonderland\\" and \\"Daughters\\" are definitely his lamest songs - I believe he begged his record label not to release \\"Daughters\\" as a single. Anyway - his last CD, \\"Continuum\\" has quite a number of terrific bluesy songs. Great lyrics, too. (Although I have to admit that the song he wrote for the \\"Bucket List\\" movie was also pretty lame.) There aren't very many \\"Singer-Songwriter\\" types around anymore (i.e., Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Clapton, Winwood, etc) - so this kid's music is pretty refreshing. BTW - as a middle-aged woman, I appreciate the fact that he talks about his parents in some of his songs - what a nice boy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Wilfully eclectic, Leftism never settled on a single genre, dabbling in tribal, trance, dub, house and ambient music. The quality never dipped, proving that a long-form dance record - one that worked as a coherent suite of music rather than a collection of 12-inch singles - was possible. It was among the first British albums to bring the club into the living room, alongside releases by The Chemical Brothers, Underworld and The Prodigy. The duo behind Leftfield, Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, had started out in punk bands, and retained the ethos that \\"music that takes from other places but moves on\\". To that end, they borrowed from Afrobeat, indie and punk itself - even cajoling former Sex Pistol John Lydon into singing the album's breakout single Open Up. These days Barnes continues to record and perform as Leftfield (with Daley's blessing) and, starting on Thursday, he embarks on a UK tour in which Leftism will be played in full for the first time. The project was initially planned for the record's 20th anniversary, but is only coming to fruition now, in its 22nd year. Ahead of the tour dates, Barnes and Daley chatted to the BBC about the making of Leftism, its impact, and their ear-splitting live shows. What do you remember about the making of Leftism? Paul Daley: Lots of late nights on the computer, synths and samplers in the week and then I was off DJing at the weekends. It was all very fast moving and constantly evolving, much like the scene at the time. Neil Barnes: A lot of stuff was done on the fly. We were just being creative in the studio. We weren't completely into indie, we weren't completely into techno. We'd get bored and think, 'We've done a [dance] track, now let's do something down-tempo, or a hip-hop track.' Is that why it still sounds fresh today? NB: I think the thing about the album is that it takes you on a journey through electronic music. There isn't one style. It's unusual in that, I think. PD: I wanted the album to sound exotic, have its own identity and have its own place amongst everything else around at the time. That time was great for music in the UK and as time goes by the '90s, and what happened creatively, is only now coming into focus and I'm really chuffed what we did is considered as something special. Leftism is frequently cited as a breakthrough, in that it showed dance music could work in an album format. Was that your intention? PD: It had to be more than a collection of instrumental formula dance records but I didn't really know it worked until I was editing it together at the end. It was a calculated risk at the time but not really intentional. Happy accidents, and all that. What's the most unusual instrument on the album? NB: There's a berimbau at the start of Afro Left. It's probably the oldest instrument, aside from hitting a drum, in the world. It's a stringed instrument from Brazil, and they hit it with a pebble. I'll be bringing it on the tour with me. John Lydon has called Open Up one of his favourite lyrics. Did you realise it was special at the time? NB: I think it's one of the best songs he ever wrote. When he came in and did the vocal, we realised we had to get the rest of the backing track up to the standard of the lyric. His vocal performance was so incredible, we felt we needed to match it. We changed the bassline radically and added a lot more drums. Your live shows got a reputation for being louder than Concorde. How bad was it? NB: The speakers were so loud your eyeballs would vibrate. Did you really make plaster fall off the roof of Brixton Academy? NB: A whole bit of the ceiling came down, not just a few chunks. You could see it all over the dancefloor. I've seen worse, though. We once shook a metal grating off when we played a soundcheck in a university. It came down and hit the floor. If anyone had been near it, they'd have been dead. I was terrified. And we brought a whole bar down in Amsterdam. When our sound man fired up the system, it all came down. Bottles, glasses, everything, flying off the wall. Who paid for it? I have no idea. What made you decide to revisit the album now? NB: It just seems like a good time to say \\"bon voyage\\" to Leftism. I'm not really going to be playing these songs much more. How hard has it been to recreate the record for the tour? NB: It's an unbelievable job of forensic investigation. It's taken months. The album didn't go onto tape at the time, so we've gone back to the raw files to find stuff and build the sounds up so it sounds like the album. Is the concert a faithful rendition of the album? NB: It is, but all the tracks are expanded. Some of them are 12 minutes long now. Like Release The Pressure, I've incorporated the single [mix] into the album version, so you get a bit of Cheshire Cat's vocals. And there's no encore. 20th Century Poem was always going to be the closer. Paul, do you miss playing live? Will you go to see the shows? PD: I don't really miss anything as I find \\"missing\\" things can be negative. I have great memories and still get a buzz from DJing which, in my eyes, is and always has been a performance and artform. People come up to me and shake my hand for what I did in Leftfield between 1989 and 2002 and that's enough for me. Finally, what do you see as Leftism's legacy? Who are your direct descendants? PD: Anyone who's thought, \\"I'm going to buy some decks, synths, samplers and make a record\\" since 1989. Also anyone who has thought, \\"I can make a record in my bedroom today and play it in my DJ set at the weekend\\". That was the revolution that has had a massive impact on musical history and which we were part of and it just seems to roll on and get handed down to the next generation for them to put their own stamp on it. By no means are Leftfield wholly responsible - but we were part of a forward-thinking global musical movement that exploded at the end of the 20th Century and turned pop culture on it's head. Leftism 22 is out now on Sony. Leftfield tour the album around the UK for the rest of the month, starting in Bristol on Thursday 11, May.

When Anoop Kapitan left his home in South Africa to come to the UK in 1970, he had no idea it would be the last time he would see his brother for more than four decades. Anoop moved to Glasgow aged 20 to study at Strathclye University, but just a few years later his elder brother Karan moved to Australia, where he set up an accountancy firm. The pair kept in touch via letter, and then email, but had not seen each other face to face for 44 year until they met in Melbourne in December. Anoop had virtually given up hope of seeing his relative again after being diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1999, when doctors told him he only had ten years of normal life left. Scroll down for video. Anoop (left) and Karan Kapitan embrace as they meet each other for the first time in 44 years after they both moved away from the family home in South Africa to opposite sides of the world. Anoop studied in Glasgow before settling in Yorkshire, while Karan moved to Melbourne. When Anoop was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1999, he virtually gave up hope of seeing his brother again. Mr Kapitan said: 'My elder brother is in his late seventies now. He emigrated to Australia where he lived his life, and I lived my life in the UK. 'We both led very hectic lives – I travelled a lot with my job as a troubleshooting engineer for a big company, whilst Karan was busy establishing a successful accountancy firm in Melbourne. 'Up until this point, neither of us had the time to reconnect. 'I have travelled to 49 countries around the world including North Thailand and Turkey, so this landmark trip to Australia marked my fiftieth country.' Anoop grew up in his family home in Johannesburg where his parents ran the famous Kapitan's restaurant which was visited by Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie. Aged 20 he left to study in Glasgow, before settling in Holmfirth, Yorkshire, where he raised a family and now has two children. Anoop and Karan (pictured bottom right, and top centre) grew up in Johannesburg where their parents owned the famous Kapitan's restaurant, frequented by Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie. Anoop travelled to 49 different countries as part of his job as an engineer, but had never been to Australia until he was reunited with Karan after more than four decades. A few years after he departed South Africa his brother Karan also left the family home, but he went the opposite way, travelling to Melbourne where he started a business. In 1999, while Anoop was only in his Forties, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and given just ten years to live a normal life, so he never expected to see his relative again. But Qatar Airways and Manchester Airport arranged a flight for him to Melborne, where the pair were tearfully reunited in December last year. Anoop added: 'I longed to be with family again. I don't know what kind of man I will find when I get to Australia, but I will do my utmost to win his heart again. 'I was apprehensive before meeting Karan and felt nervous and a bit overwhelmed, but when I saw him standing there at the arrivals gate all my worries just disappeared.

It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal. Umbopo explains that Gagoola had attempted to sacrifice Jesse in order to keep her power as the Kukuanas' ruler because... Answer:","completion":"Can't answer"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jackson's confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms, so she's never unpleasant to listen to.\\"Matthew Perpetus of Fluxblog suggested Jackson's vocal techniques as a study for indie rock music, considering it to possess \\"a somewhat subliminal effect on the listener, guiding and emphasizing dynamic shifts without distracting attention from its primal hooks.\\" Perpetus added: \\"Her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance ... a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that we're listening to the expression of a fully-formed human being with contradictions and complexities.\\"Jackson's music has encompassed a broad range of genres.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the last name of Drake's mentor? Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic.

He seeks help from a renowned therapist named Dr. Elden. In these surreal dreams, his closest friend Jane always seems to be involved, often as a malevolent figure pursuing and attacking him. Act 2: Dr. Elden suggests that Brooks participates in a cutting-edge therapy treatment involving a new technique called dream-sharing. This procedure allows Brooks and his therapist to explore and navigate his nightmares together to find answers. As they delve deeper into Brooks' perilous dream world, they become increasingly convinced of Jane's involvement in his recurring nightmares. Brooks confronts Jane about the situation, but she denies any connection to his dreams. However, the nightmares grow even more vivid and intense, making Brooks question their friendship and ultimately suspect that Jane may hold a dark secret. Act 3: As Brooks continues to investigate his own mind, he and Dr. Elden uncover a repressed childhood memory involving Jane, a tragic incident that led to the death of another friend. In reality, Jane has blamed herself for the accident and always felt a deep sense of guilt. Unconsciously, this guilt has manifested itself in Brooks' dreams as recurring nightmares, projecting Jane as a murderer. In the thrilling climax, both Brooks and Jane confront their shared past through dream-sharing technology, with Dr. Elden guiding them. As they piece together the truth behind the tragic event, they realize that it wasn't entirely Jane's fault, and they both shared responsibility to some extent. Resolution: Brooks' nightmares finally come to a halt as both he and Jane acknowledge their shared past and work on putting the painful memory behind them to rebuild their friendship. Through confronting the darkness in their minds, they find peace and forgiveness, allowing them to move forward with their lives. \\"Dreamscape: The Killing of Brooks\\" becomes a psychological thriller where Brooks' nightmares serve as a metaphor for facing and addressing buried memories and emotions.

Here is a goal: To get more from each melon when using a melon baller. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Available options: a). Use the larger end of the melon baller.; b). Use the smaller end of the melon baller.;","completion":"To accomplish the goal of getting more from each melon when using a melon baller, both options, a) using the larger end of the melon baller and b) using the smaller end, have their advantages and disadvantages. The optimal choice for you would depend on what you value more: the amount of melon balls created, the size of the melon balls, or reducing the potential waste of the melon's flesh. Option A: Use the larger end of the melon baller Advantages: 1. Larger melon balls: The larger end of the melon baller will create bigger melon balls, which would result in more melon to eat per ball. This could look more aesthetically pleasing in fruit salads, and larger melon balls may be more enjoyable to eat due to their size. 2. Faster scooping: Using the larger end will help you scoop more melon flesh quickly, resulting in reduced time spent on preparing the melon. Disadvantages: 1. Less melon balls overall: As you are creating larger melon balls, you will have fewer melon balls in total, which could be a downside if you prefer having a greater number of individual pieces. 2. Increased waste: The larger end may not fit as well into smaller sections of the melon, possibly leaving more flesh on the rind after scooping. This could lead to more waste if you cannot effectively remove the remaining melon flesh with a smaller melon baller, knife, or other kitchen utensil. Option B: Use the smaller end of the melon baller Advantages: 1. More melon balls overall: Using the smaller end of the melon baller will create a greater number of melon balls, which could be useful if you need to serve a larger group of people or prefer smaller bites. 2. Reduced waste: Smaller melon balls allow for better scooping in the curves and irregular sections of the melon, resulting in more efficient use of the flesh and less waste. Disadvantages: 1. Smaller melon balls: The smaller end creates smaller melon balls, which might not be as visually appealing or enjoyable to eat in comparison to the larger melon balls. This could be a downside if you're aiming to create a visually appealing fruit salad, for example. 2. Slower scooping: Since you are creating smaller melon balls, it may take more time to scoop out the entire melon. In conclusion, if you prioritize having larger, more visually appealing melon balls and value reduced preparation time, using the larger end of the melon baller (Option A) might make more sense for you. However, if your goal is to have a greater number of melon balls, minimize waste, and better utilize the entire melon, then using the smaller end of the melon baller (Option B) would be the better choice. It's essential to consider which factors are the most important to you based on factors such as personal preference, the specific use or presentation of the melon balls, or the size of your melon, in order to make the most suitable decision for your needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.

The goal of the tax was to generate additional revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit. This tax was levied on material goods such as watches, expensive furs, boats, yachts, private jet planes, jewelry and expensive cars. Congress enacted a 10 percent luxury surcharge tax on boats over 100,000, cars over 30,000, aircraft over 250,000, and furs and jewelry over 10,000. The federal government estimated that it would raise 9 billion in excess revenues over the following five-year period. However, only two years after its imposition, in August 1993, the Congress decided to eliminate the \`\`luxury tax'' since it did not achieve its main objective. It is noteworthy that it \`\`failed'' by only raising 8.9 billion--that is, it fell 97 million short of its projected revenue. According to the tax's critics, these revenues were disappointing and unsatisfactory and also negatively impacted the incomes of the sellers of the luxury items. However, the luxury automobile tax remained in effect until 2002. is there a luxury tax in the united states?","completion":"As of now, there is no specific luxury tax in the United States similar to the one enacted in 1991. However, that does not mean luxury items are completely free from additional taxes or fees. Instead, federal, state, and local governments may levy different taxes and fees that could apply to luxury items. For example, some states may have higher sales taxes for specific luxury goods like vehicles or luxury real estate property taxes. The original luxury tax of 1991 was ultimately repealed due to its negative and unintended consequences on the industries it targeted, like the aforementioned yacht and luxury car industry. The tax led to decreased demand for these items, causing job losses and lower-than-expected revenue generation. As previously mentioned, the luxury automobile tax remained in effect until 2002, when it was phased out. Presently, taxation in the United States focuses mainly on income, sales, property, and corporate taxes. High-income individuals may face higher tax brackets and capital gains taxes when they earn above certain thresholds. But a specific luxury tax on items like yachts, jewelry, and furs does not currently exist in the United States. It is worth noting that the concept of a luxury tax still exists in the realm of professional sports, such as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB). These leagues impose a luxury tax to control team spending on player salaries and promote competitive balance within the leagues. However, this form of luxury tax is not imposed by the government and applies only to specific sports organizations."},{"prompt":"Question: What are the last names of the two men in love with Kit?

Apple has become... (Associated Press) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple has become the world's first publicly traded company to be valued at 1 trillion. The milestone marks the triumph of stylish technology that has redefined what we expect from our gadgets ever since two mavericks named Steve started the company 42 years ago. The peak reached Thursday seemed unimaginable in 1997 when Apple teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, with its stock trading for less than 1. To survive, Apple brought back its once-exiled co-founder, Steve Jobs, as interim CEO and turned to its archrival Microsoft for a 150 million cash infusion to help pay its bills. Jobs eventually introduced popular products such as the iPod and iPhone that subsequently drove Apple's rise. The stock has been surging this week as anticipation mounts for the next generation of iPhone, expected to be released in September. Apple hit the 1 trillion mark when its shares reached an all-time high of 207.05 around midday in New York. The shares are up 22 percent so far this year. Jobs' vision, showmanship and sense of style propelled Apple's comeback. But it might not have happened if he hadn't evolved into a more mature leader after his exit from the company in 1985. His ignominious departure came after losing a power struggle with John Sculley, a former Pepsico executive who he recruited to become Apple's CEO in 1983 — seven years after he and his geeky friend Steve Wozniak teamed up to start the company with the administrative help of Ronald Wayne. Jobs remained mercurial when he returned to Apple, but he had also become more thoughtful and adept at spotting talent that would help him create a revolutionary innovation factory. One of his biggest coups came in 1998 when he lured a soft-spoken Southerner, Tim Cook, away from Compaq Computer at a time when Apple's survival remained in doubt. Cook's hiring may have been one of the best things Jobs did for Apple. In addition, that is, to shepherding a decade-long succession of iconic products that transformed Apple from a technological boutique to a cultural phenomenon and moneymaking machine. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In 1976, Apple was started by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.

The mother, Gladys Perry (Jennifer Griffin), explains that their religious beliefs put them on a higher plane where such activities are forbidden. Just then the doorbell rings and some children outside yell \\"trick or treat.\\" Gladys answers the door and explains they don't participate in the holiday because they are Jehovah's Witness.Meanwhile, Larry Billings, a prison guard, returns to the prison to get some paperwork to do at home even as the two prisoners in their cells (Butch and Terry) consult with an elderly inmate regarding where the vents go. Once Butch and Terry break through the vents, and it is clear that an escape is underway, Butch tells Terry that they will separate when they get free and reach the state line because he doesn't like Terry. And Terry agrees with that plan as their hatred for each other coalesces. Butch and Terry get past the guard at the gate in Larry's car with Larry at the wheel. Once they reach town they commandeer Larry's car and search for a new escape car. Terry is sidetracked by Gladys making breakfast. Terry breaks into the kitchen holding a gun and terrorizes her, grabbing her around the neck for a smooch.

Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused.

Article: Self-employed private physicians who charge a fee for each patient visit are the foundation of medical practice in the United States. Most physicians have a contract relationship with one or more hospitals in the community. They send their patients to this hospital, which usually charges patients according to the number of days they stay and the facilities(operating room, tests, medicines that they use). Some hospitals belong to a city, a state or, in the case of veteran's hospitals, a federal government agency. Others are operated by religious orders or other non-profit groups. Some medical doctors are on salary. Salaried physicians may work as hospital staff members, or residents, who are often still in training. They may teach in medical schools, be hired by corporations to care for their workers or work for the federal government's Public Health Service. Physicians are among the best paid professionals in the United States. In the 1980s, it was not uncommon for medical doctors to earn incomes of more than 100 000 a year. Specialists, particularly surgeons, might earn several times that amount. Physicians list many reasons why they deserve to be so well rewarded for their work. One reason is the long and expensive preparation required to become a physician in the United States. Most would be physicians first attend college for four years, which can cost nearly 20 000 a year at one of the best private institutions. Prospective physicians then attend medical school for four years. Tuition alone can exceed 10 000 a year.

Voters who back UKIP at the next election risk 'going to bed with Nigel Farage and waking up with Ed Miliband', David Cameron has warned. The Prime Minister said the next election would be a 'straight fight' between Labour and the Tories, and a vote for UKIP made it more likely that Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister in 2015. The jibe came just hours before former Tory donor Arron Banks announced he was handing £1million to UKIP, in protest at being dismissed as a 'nobody' by senior Conservative William Hague. Scroll down for video David Cameron warned that a vote for UKIP would make it easier for Labour to win the next election The joke was captured in this photograph of the autocue, after Mr OPTIONS: - Arron Banks rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - David Cameron rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Ed Miliband rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Labour rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Miliband rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Nigel Farage rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Tories rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Tory rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - UKIP rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - William Hague rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory","completion":"The sentence ends with: David Cameron rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory. In this case, David Cameron, the Prime Minister at the time, was using the opportunity to emphasize the contrasting approaches between his party, the Conservatives, and Ed Miliband's Labour Party. By rejecting the idea of delivering the speech from memory, as Ed Miliband had done previously, he sought to convey that he was confident in his message and strategy. Furthermore, this statement could be seen as an attempt by Cameron to further discredit UKIP by asserting that voting for them would ultimately be a self-defeating act for voters, as it would actually increase the likelihood of a Labour victory, something UKIP voters were presumably not in favor of. The implication of this warning is that tactical voting should be employed by the electorate and they should strategically vote for the Conservatives, the main rivals to the Labour Party, if they wished to prevent the latter from coming into power. Cameron's comment references Ed Miliband, the former leader of the Labour Party, to make a point about the consequences of voting for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in the upcoming election. This was meant to suggest that although some voters might be attracted to the idea of supporting UKIP due to their hardline stances on various issues, such as immigration and the European Union, doing so would weaken the Conservative Party's chances of winning the election and inadvertently aid Miliband and the Labour Party. Concerning the announcement by Arron Banks, a former Tory donor, that he would be donating £1 million to UKIP, symbolizes a further challenge to the Conservative Party. This suggests that some individuals who had previously been associated with the Tories believed that UKIP could provide a more suitable political alternative. This was a cause for concern for David Cameron, particularly given that he was already attempting to fend off UKIP's growing electoral appeal. Overall, David Cameron's statement, captured on the autocue, serves as both a warning to potential UKIP voters and an attempt to discourage defections from his party, by stressing the potential unintended consequences of supporting UKIP in the upcoming election."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Authorities say Scott died after jumping off a bridge in Los Angeles on Sunday, Aug.... (Associated Press) The 68-year-old Scott's death was being investigated as a suicide, Los Angeles County Coroner's Lt. Joe Bale said. \\"I can confirm that Tony Scott has passed away. The family asks that their privacy is respected at this time,\\" Scott's spokesman, Simon Halls, said in a statement. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday, coroner's Chief of Operations Craig Harvey said. He said investigators located several notes to loved ones that Scott left in his car and at another location, but that they were not described in initial reports as suicide notes. He said Scott parked his car at the crest of the bridge, which is 185 feet above water, before leaping to his death. Several people called police around 12:35 p.m. to report that someone had jumped from the Vincent Thomas Bridge spanning San Pedro and Terminal Island in Los Angeles Harbor, according to police Lt. Tim Nordquist. A dive team with Los Angeles Port Police pulled the body from the murky water several hours later, Nordquist said. Scott's body was taken to a dock in Wilmington and turned over to the county coroner's office. One lane of the eastbound side of the bridge was closed to traffic during the investigation. Cargo vessels moved at reduced speeds through the east side of the port's main channel during the search, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. The British-born Scott, who lived in Beverly Hills, was producer and director Ridley Scott's younger brother.

Scott was a thrill-seeker himself in his personal life, an avid rock climber who also liked driving fast cars and motorcycles. Still, filmmaking was his real thrill. \\"The biggest edge I live on is directing. That's the most scary, dangerous thing you can do in your life,\\" Scott said in an interview for his 1995 naval adventure \\"Crimson Tide.\\" \`'The scariest thing in my life is the first morning of production on all my movies. It's the fear of failing, the loss of face and a sense of guilt that everybody puts their faith in you and not coming through.\\" Tony was the first of the Scott brothers to enjoy blockbuster success with \\"Top Gun,\\" starring Tom Cruise, the top-grossing film of 1986 at 176 million. Scott teamed with Cruise again four years later on the hit \\"Days of Thunder.\\" He also had a sequel to \\"Top Gun\\" in development. But Ridley Scott later managed more and bigger hits than his brother and earned a level of critical respect never achieved by Tony Scott. \\"Gladiator\\" won the best-picture Academy Award for 2000 and earned Ridley Scott one of his three best-director nominations; Tony Scott never was in the running for an Oscar, and critics often slammed his movies for emphasizing style over substance. Even Scott admitted that it was a challenge to infuse drama into some of his scenarios _ for example, cars racing in circles in \\"Days of Thunder.\\" In an interview for that 1990 summer hit, Scott was blunt about where some of the ideas came from. \\"I went back and I stole from all race movies to date,\\" Scott said. \\"I took the better elements, then tried to build on them. Really, the speed, the energy and the placement of the audience inside some of the cars came in the editing room ... \\"I'm always pushing for something new and fresh in the way things are shot, and the rest happens in the editing room ... The real speed comes from the cutters and what they do with the celluloid.\\" While Ridley Scott had an auspicious start to his film career with 1977's acclaimed period drama \\"The Duellists\\" and 1979's \\"Alien,\\" Tony Scott bombed with his debut, 1983's supernatural romance \\"The Hunger,\\" with David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve. He vaulted into Hollywood's top ranks the next time out, with \\"Top Gun,\\" followed a year later by \\"Beverly Hills Cop II,\\" both with producer Jerry Bruckheimer. The two brothers ran Scott Free Productions and were working jointly on a film called \\"Killing Lincoln,\\" based on the best seller by Bill O'Reilly. Along with countless commercials, their company produced the CBS dramas \\"NUMB3RS\\" and \\"The Good Wife\\" as well as a 2011 documentary about the Battle of Gettysburg for the History Channel. Tony Scott said he gained perspective by mixing things up between film, TV and commercials. \\"I like changing the pace of my life, changing my discipline. It gives me ideas for how to see the world differently,\\" Scott said in a 2007 interview. Besides \\"Unstoppable,\\" Scott worked with Washington on four other movies: \\"Crimson Tide,\\" \`'Man on Fire,\\" \`'Deja Vu\\" and \\"The Taking of Pelham 123.\\" In a tweet Sunday, director Ron Howard said, \\"No more Tony Scott movies.

During the Leveson Inquiry, a stream of celebrities poured into the Royal Courts of Justice to talk about the iniquities of the Press. Star after star called for tighter regulation on newspapers, telling Lord Justice Leveson how the tabloids had hounded them, made their lives miserable and used every ‘dark art’ imaginable. But the phone hacking trial has lifted the veil on the other side of the relationship between celebrities and the tabloid Press – and it’s a side Lord Justice Leveson’s cast of famous faces was less eager to discuss. Scroll down for video. Close friends: Jude Law, far left, with Sienna Miller and Daniel Craig. The jury heard evidence about the alleged affair between Miller and Craig. Self-confessed phone hacker Dan Evans claimed he had uncovered the relationship when he hacked the 007 actor's voicemails. With combative lawyers prepared to scrutinise the evidence of witnesses, the trial revealed the underbelly of celebrity: how friends, family and even the famous themselves willingly sold stories to the News of the World for money, influence or to extend their own time in the spotlight. There were revelations about George Best’s son Calum, socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and Eimear Cook, ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie. It emerged that former Home Secretary David Blunkett complained to a friend that ‘hyenas’ had betrayed him – little suspecting his friend was the one who had tipped off newspapers and would ultimately sell his voicemails to the highest bidder. And perhaps most dramatically of all, Hollywood star Jude Law was confronted in court with information that a close member of his own family had sold secrets about him. Visibly shaken, the actor said the unnamed male relative had admitted giving information to the newspaper but said he had not known the man had taken the tabloid’s money. The jury heard claims the actor had effectively approved a front page story revealing his former fiancée Sienna Miller’s affair with James Bond star Daniel Craig. Law denied he had sanctioned the 2005 article, but the court heard his publicist had asked the tabloid to ‘back-date’ Miss Miller’s affair with Craig so it would appear she cheated on Law before he was caught out in a fling with his children’s nanny. In a taped conversation with a journalist, Law’s publicist appeared to be speaking on his behalf when she said: ‘If you could definitely pre-date it so that she cheated first, that’s the thing he wants the most.’ Coulson, then editor of the News of. the World, was so confident the article had been signed off by Law that. he told sub-editors to avoid calling him a ‘love rat’ and emailed a. colleague saying: ‘This story is effectively from Jude.’ The affair between Miss Miller and. Craig was a key part of the prosecution case. Self-confessed phone. hacker Dan Evans claimed he had uncovered the relationship when he. hacked the 007 actor’s voicemails. But. Miss Miller’s own driver had apparently sold the story to the tabloid. for £6,000 after catching the actress at a secret rendezvous with Craig. There. is no dispute that phone hacking happened at the tabloid. Miss Miller,. for example, received £100,000 damages from Rupert Murdoch’s News Group. Newspapers. But lawyers at the trial set out to. show that journalists and newspapers relied on countless legitimate. sources to gather information. The judge told lawyers he was anxious the trial should not unravel into a ‘celebrity chat show’ dominated by star witnesses. Unlike the Leveson Inquiry – which faced. criticism that it gave celebrities a platform to make any complaint. about the Press they chose, seemingly without challenge – trial. witnesses had their evidence scrutinised to the standards of a criminal. trial. Former Head of News International Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie Brooks sit in a taxi as they leave the Old Bailey after being cleared yesterday. Brooks' deputy and later editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson was swept from court after being found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones. Among the startling revelations:. CALUM BEST. The son of footballer George Best admitted he had ‘actively encouraged’ some media intrusion into his personal life. The 33-year-old pocketed £2,000 from the News of the World for the story of his own sordid nightclub tryst with Mick Jagger’s daughter Elizabeth. Calum Best pocketed £2,000 from the. News of the World for the story of his own nightclub tryst with. Mick Jagger’s daughter Elizabeth. He also passed on stories about his friends. Mr Justice Saunders said: ‘Calum Best is a full-time “celebrity”. He needs publicity in order to remain a full-time “celebrity”. He sometimes supplies information to the Press himself.’ TARA PALMER-TOMKINSON. Prince Charles’ goddaughter was revealed as one of the News of the World’s sources for information about the Royal Family. Tara-Palmer Tomkinson was revealed as one of the News of the World's sources for information about the Royal Family. Former royal editor Clive Goodman ‘outed’ her as the source for its story about Prince William’s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle being gatecrashed by ‘comedy terrorist’ Aaron Barschak in 2003. Then Andy Coulson confirmed the newspaper had paid a ‘female’ source for this story – and other royal scoops – although he did not name Miss Palmer-Tomkinson. SIENNA MILLER. Miss Miller - hailed as a 'hacking heroine' when she took civil action against the News of the World and gave evidence to Leveson - used her time as a witness to complain once again about media coverage. Miss Miller – hailed as a ‘hacking heroine’ when she took civil action against the News of the World and gave evidence to Leveson – used her time as a witness to complain once again about media coverage of the evidence surrounding her ‘very brief encounter’ with Daniel Craig. ‘This is a really difficult and uncomfortable part of my life to discuss, seeing as it’s been allowed out of the courtroom and into the hands of the world’s media to be gossiped [over] and analysed, and me vilified for it,’ she said. It’s been turned into this titillating piece of information. I really regret that it has been allowed to be analysed in the way that it has.’ Trial judge Mr Justice Saunders said he was sorry if coverage had upset Miss Miller but assured her the evidence had been necessary. He did not say – but some in the courtroom could be forgiven for thinking – that the actress’ hurt feelings were not his priority in a complex trial in which seven people’s reputations and liberty hung in the balance. EIMEAR COOK. Eimear Cook, ex wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie, also gave evidence to the court. The ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie denied claims she had told Brooks about a ‘violent event’ during her 14-year marriage in the hope Brooks would expose her ex-husband in the Sun. Mrs Cook, who accepted a payout from the News of the World for phone hacking, denied she had invented her evidence to boost her civil claim for aggravated damages. She was accused of telling a ‘bare-face lie’ in her evidence, when she claimed Brooks had told her it was ‘easy’ to hack phones. Mrs Cook, 43, said Brooks told her about phone hacking at a meeting in 2005 in which the then Sun editor had also laughed about her own arrest for an alleged assault on her then husband, EastEnders actor Ross Kemp. Mrs Cook was accused of lying when it emerged that Brooks’ arrest did not take place until several weeks after the meeting.

A. making babies B. bliss C. unwanted pregnancy D. aids E. orgasm The best answer is Answer:","completion":"D. aids Twenty years ago, during the late 1990s and early 2000s, having sex as a gay man was often associated with a higher risk of contracting the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which could lead to the development of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). This was primarily due to the nature of HIV transmission, the high rates of infection among men who have sex with men (MSM), and the stigma surrounding homosexuality at that time. Although HIV can affect anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, it disproportionately impacted the gay community during this period. The primary mode of transmission for HIV is through sexual contact — particularly, anal intercourse, which carries a higher risk compared to other forms of sexual activity. While all the answers provided could potentially be outcomes of sexual activity for gay men (with the exception of C, unwanted pregnancy), the prevalence of HIV and AIDS within the gay community at that time made it the best answer for this question. Back then, HIV testing and awareness were not as widespread as they are today. A lack of understanding about the virus and how it was transmitted contributed to the rapid spread of the infection within the gay community. Stigma and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ individuals also made it difficult for those at risk or living with HIV to access appropriate healthcare, counseling, and support, further fueling the epidemic. It's important to note that while HIV and AIDS were more commonly associated with having sex as a gay man twenty years ago, significant advancements have since been made in prevention, testing, and treatment. Access to reliable information, the development of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) — a medication taken daily to prevent HIV infection, campaigns promoting the use of condoms, and the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for those living with HIV have all contributed to a significant decline in the number of new infections and HIV-related deaths. Furthermore, increased advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights and a growing acceptance of various sexual orientations in many societies have helped break down the barriers that prevented those at risk from seeking the care and support they need. In conclusion, twenty years ago, having sex as a gay man often led to a higher risk of contracting HIV, which could develop into AIDS. The combination of high infection rates within the gay community, transmission methods, and the social stigma surrounding homosexuality all contributed to the prominence of this outcome. However, the landscape has significantly changed in terms of HIV prevention, treatment, and societal acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, leading to a more optimistic outlook for those engaging in same-sex relationships today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It had been previously known as the Erlachhof, a traditional hunting estate and lodge of the Dukes of Württemberg that was destroyed in 1692, during the Nine Years' War. Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, fought against France and Bavaria. Württemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704 that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of Württemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, Stuttgart, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored.Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's cornerstone by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent Philipp Joseph Jenisch to study architecture abroad. Eberhard Louis made Jenisch director of construction upon his return the next year, but he only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau's (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before 1707. The duke spent the winter of 1705–06 at Nymphenburg Palace, residence of the Elector of Bavaria, and was impressed by what he saw there and in architectural publications. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, and defiant following the loss of the Stuttgart residence, Eberhard Louis decided to follow the example of Bavaria, Baden-Durlach, and the Rhineland Palatinate. He elected to build a new palace and town inspired by Versailles, which would be the center of his domestic society and diplomacy. Located 10..., what would be the answer ?

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who says that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease? is inside the article: Wilfred Glendon is a wealthy and world-renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time. Unfortunately Dr. Yogami, who is revealed to be a werewolf, sneaks into the lab ahead of his rival and steals the only two blossoms.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Steve Gillan, of the Prison Officers Association, said proper staff levels were needed if officers - not inmates - were to be in charge of jails. Earlier, he held talks with Justice Secretary Liz Truss over the rise in violence and suicides in prisons. Ms Truss is set to unveil what she is calling the biggest overhaul of prisons in a generation on Thursday. Mr Gillan said he wanted her reform plans to include prisoner searches as well as greater investment, saying Â£900m had been taken out of the service since 2010. \\"We are not accepting any crumbs from the table,\\" he said. He added that Ms Truss appeared to accept the prison service was in crisis, underfunded and short-staffed, and warned the POA and government would be \\"on a collision course\\" if these problems were not addressed. \\"The last thing that we want to see is more carnage and bloodbaths, and a prison officer loses his life,\\" he said, after the meeting. Are prisons becoming more dangerous places? Earlier on Wednesday, the POA, which is banned from taking industrial action, had been set to take part in an unofficial walkout. The union has set a deadline of 11 November for government to take action over prison violence, otherwise it is threatening to resume its plan of public meetings and taking control of prisons from managers. Latest figures show a new high of 65 assaults in jails every day. In the year to June, assaults on staff jumped by 43% to 5,954, with 697 of these recorded as serious. For months there has been huge concern about conditions in prisons, escalating levels of violence, self-harm and suicide. The fatal stabbing of a prisoner at Pentonville Prison, north London, propelled the issue into the headlines. Prison officers are concerned they cannot safely operate in jails with the current levels of staff. The POA wanted to hold a series of union meetings outside prison gates - visible to the public and the media - before imposing their own working practices, including letting inmates out of their cells only in small numbers. That would be a highly-restricted kind of regime. The government agreed, as part of a deal for that action to be suspended, to hold urgent talks. On Thursday, when Ms Truss is due to announce prison reforms, she is likely to continue steps taken by former Justice Secretary Michael Gove - giving governors more control and changing the way education is provided in prison. But she also has to say something about recruitment and retention of prison officers. She has already announced 400 extra staff, but the problem is in some areas it doesn't pay to be a prison officer. That's something the government's got to seriously look at, whether it involves extra pay incentives early on in someone's career or quicker pay progression. One prisoner at London's Pentonville Prison told the BBC, via a note, how he had witnessed the \\"gory\\" killing of 21-year-old Jamal Mahmoud last month. Since the incident, he said, prisoners had been \\"on lockdown\\". \\"What really worries me is the availability of weapons and the frequency and severity of the violence I have witnessed here,\\" he said. He described how razors melted into toothbrushes were fashioned into weapons and flex and plugs from in-cell kettles were used as a \\"garrotte\\" or \\"flailing\\" weapons. He also said knives were flown into Pentonville by drones. Meanwhile, a former offender told BBC's World at One about stabbings, assaults and gang violence happening almost daily at his prison. Lord Ramsbotham, former chief inspector of prisons and prison reform campaigner, said the problems were \\"not surprising\\" after the government had cut staff by a third. The fact that both officers and governors were calling for urgent action should be taken \\"very seriously\\" by the government, he told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. \\"The basis of all prisons is the relationship between staff and prisoners. Unless things are right for staff, nothing will be right for prisoners,\\" he said. He called on the government to make people publicly responsible and accountable for prisons, as they were for business, schools and hospitals; to address overcrowding; and to make sure governors led their staff. What was that article about?","completion":"This article is addressing how prisons are becoming more dangerous places. Steve Gillan from the Prison Officers Association mentioned that they need more staff members in charge of the prisons. He met with Justice Secretary Liz Truss to talk about the growing number of violent acts and suicides happening in prisons.

They also mentioned a serious problem where a prisoner was stabbed to death at a prison in London. Prison officers said they don't feel safe because they don't have enough staff and weapons are found regularly. Ms. Truss plans to make major changes in the prisons and talk about this on Thursday. She may try to give more control to the governors of prisons and change how education is given. A former prisoner talked about how dangerous it was in his prison, with fights and knife attacks happening a lot. And a man who used to inspect prisons said the government should make changes to keep prisons from getting too crowded and should make sure that the people in charge of prisons are doing a good job."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein at the corner of Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage.

Most album covers were carefully staged and controlled, to terrific effect on the Blue Note jazz album covers ... and to not-so great-effect on the perfectly posed and clean-cut pop and folk albums. Whoever was responsible for choosing that particular photograph for The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan really had an eye for a new look.

The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Which would be a better day for group B to attack group A, battle day one or battle day two? Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the hint, it is important to note that Acromyrmex heyeri ants adjust the openings in their nest thatch in response to temperature and humidity. They create more openings when the temperature is between 20-30 °C and close the openings when the air humidity decreases. On battle day one, the temperature in group A territory is 5 °C, which is significantly lower than the optimal range of 20-30 °C. As a result, it is likely that the ants will have fewer openings in their nest thatch to conserve warmth and better regulate the internal temperature of their colony. This implies that attacking group A on battle day one might be more challenging for group B since the defenses of the colony will be relatively high due to fewer openings. On battle day two, the temperature in group A territory is 22 °C, which falls within the optimal range of 20-30 °C for the creation of more nest thatch openings. This means that group A ants will likely have more openings in their nest thatch on battle day two for temperature regulation purposes. The increased number of openings would present a higher vulnerability for group A's colony, making it an opportune time for group B to attack. Although humidity also plays a role in the ants' decision to open or close nest thatch openings, the temperature factor seems to have a more significant impact based on the provided information. With this in mind, it would be better for group B to attack group A on battle day two when the temperature is 22 °C, as this falls within the optimal range for having more openings in the nest thatch, consequently making the colony more susceptible to attack."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.

It is the largest high school science competition in the world. The Maryland teenager is the youngest winner of the 75,000 prize. He was chosen from among 1,500 students in 70 countries. Jack Andraka invented a test for pancreatic cancer . He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. \\"I went on the Internet and I found that 85%of all pancreatic cancers are found late, when someone has less than 2% chance of survival , \\" he says, \\"and I was thinking,' That's not right. We should be able to do something.'\\" He found that early discovery is important to increasing the chances of surviving the disease. The Maryland teenager asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test, which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His test has proved correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. \\"It costs 3 cents per test, and then it takes only 5 minutes to run,\\" he said. Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra, a professor at Johns Hopkins. He was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to who showed interest in his project. \\"I was very surprised that this was a 15-year-old who was writing this. I wanted to meet this clever young man and see what he wanted to talk about and so I called him over for an interview . \\" Jack worked in Professor Maitra's laboratory, completing his project in 7 months. The government has given the Maryland teenager patent rights to the pancreatic cancer test. He is now talking with companies about developing the test into a simple product.

Baby is the younger of two daughters, and plans to attend Mount Holyoke College to study economics in underdeveloped countries and then enter the Peace Corps. Her father, Jake (Jerry Orbach), is the doctor and friend of Max Kellerman (Jack Weston), the resort proprietor. Baby is befriended by Max's grandson Neil (Lonny Price). Baby develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Johnny is the leader of the resort's working-class entertainment staff. Baby encounters Johnny's cousin Billy on a walk through the resort grounds, and helps him carry watermelons to the staff quarters. The staff hold secret after-hours parties in their quarters, and Baby is surprised by the \\"dirty dancing\\" they engage in.[12] Intrigued, Baby receives a brief, impromptu dance lesson from Johnny. After Baby discovers that Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes), is pregnant by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter who is also dating and cheating on Baby's older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker) and several other female guests, she borrows money from her father to pay for an illegal abortion for Penny. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the Mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.

Premise: \\"It seems to me in America, where we rejoice in the fact that we are a nation devoted to the rule of law, we should not ration access to justice.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"In America, justice should only be for the upper class.\\"?","completion":"If we assume the premise to be true, that in America the nation prides itself on being devoted to the rule of law and should not ration access to justice, it would be contradictory to the given hypothesis \\"In America, justice should only be for the upper class.\\" Let's analyze this in greater detail. The premise highlights some important ideas about the American legal system: 1. Devotion to the rule of law: The rule of law is a central principle in the American legal system, which posits that every individual, regardless of their status or power, should be held equally accountable under the law. It emphasizes impartiality, fairness, and equality, asserting that no one is above the law. 2. No rationing of access to justice: Rationing implies that a resource or service should be selectively distributed, often based on specific criteria such as socioeconomic status or other factors. The premise suggests that the American legal system should not allow for any such rationing when it comes to accessing justice, implying that everyone should have an equal opportunity to seek justice, irrespective of their backgrounds. Now, let's consider the hypothesis \\"In America, justice should only be for the upper class.\\" This statement directly contradicts the two main ideas of the premise: 1. Equality under the law: By suggesting that justice should only be for the upper class, this hypothesis implies that there is a distinction between the upper class and the rest of the population in terms of how the law should be applied or enforced. This contradicts the idea that everyone should be treated equally under the law. 2. Rationing of justice: If justice were only to be accessible to the upper class, as the hypothesis suggests, it would mean that justice is being rationed based on socioeconomic status - which is in direct opposition to the idea mentioned in the premise that there should be no rationing of access to justice. From this analysis, it becomes evident that if we accept the premise as true, it cannot logically entail the given hypothesis. In fact, the premise refutes the hypothesis by emphasizing the importance of treating everyone equally under the law and ensuring that access to justice is not rationed based on factors like class or socioeconomic status. Therefore, if we maintain the premise to be true, it leads to the conclusion that, in America, justice should not be exclusive to the upper class but rather be accessible to all citizens, upholding the core principle of equality under the law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Johnny Depp sued his former business managers Friday alleging they mismanaged his earnings throughout a lucrative period of his career, although the company says the actor's spending is to blame. Depp's lawsuit filed against The Management Group seeks more than 25 million, reports the AP, alleging it failed to properly pay his taxes, made unauthorized loans, and overpaid for security. Michael J. Kump, an attorney for The Management Group, calls Depp's lawsuit a \\"fabrication.\\" The company \\"did everything possible to protect Depp from his irresponsible and profligate spending,\\" Kump wrote. Depp's suit accuses the company and its owners, attorneys Joel and Robert Mandel, of receiving 28 million in payments for services over 16 years. The company \\"actively concealed the true state of Mr. Depp's finances while driving him deeper and deeper into financial distress,\\" the suit states. Depp hired the Mandels in 1999 and they received 5% of his income on hit films such as the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Alice in Wonderland, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The lawsuit alleges the company failed to file Depp's tax returns on time, costing him nearly 5.7 million in penalties. The lawsuit also alleges the company overpaid for several services, including forgetting to terminate the lease on a home where Depp's mother lived temporarily, and spending 8 million on security between 2012 and 2015 alone. Depp learned of the problems after hiring new management in March 2016. Kump wrote that Depp owes The Management Group 4.2 million from a 5 million loan. \\"His tactics and lawsuit will fail, and he will be forced to pay back the loan as promised,\\" Kump wrote. The suit came the same day Depp finalized his divorce from Amber Heard, which calls for Depp to pay 7 million in installments. Heard gets to keep the couple's dogs, notes the BBC, Pistol and Boo.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the descendant of Robert Campbell? , can you please find it? The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours.

They dream big dreams and then show great courage to do things that others say cannot be done. Your dreams form the foundation of success. Many people have long forgotten the dreams they used to have when they were kids. As they grow older, they are simply too caught up with their work activities that they fail to discover what they really want to pursue in life. To get you back on track to pursue your dreams, follow these steps: Learn to dream again; We are born to dream. But we hear of teachers calling in school: \\"Stop dreaming and pay attention in class!\\" Parents , too, have shouted, \\"Stop dreaming and go on with your homework!\\" In the end, many do get \\"realistic\\" and give up their dreams in time. Dream big dreams; Never set mental boundaries on what you are able to achieve. Dreams are free anyway so as long as you are dreaming, you might as well dream big.

Question: \\"What kind of contrast is seen in hard pines?\\" Context: \\"If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In hard pines, on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In hard pines, the contrast seen relates to the distinct differences between the earlywood and the latewood in terms of their density, color, and textural properties. This contrast arises from the growth patterns and the way wood is formed in these species, leading to significant variations in their physical characteristics. Earlywood refers to the portion of the growth ring developed at the beginning of the growing season. It typically consists of larger, thin-walled cells that give the wood a lighter, softer, and more pliable texture. In hard pines, earlywood appears straw-colored, providing a visual distinction from the darker latewood. Latewood, on the other hand, is formed during the latter part of the growing season when the tree's growth slows down. It consists of smaller, thicker-walled cells resulting in a denser and stronger material. In hard pines, the latewood is characterized by its deep coloration and significantly higher density compared to the earlywood. The presence of a large proportion of latewood in hard pines also gives them more clearly demarcated growth rings, as indicated in the context provided. The contrast observed in hard pines plays a crucial role in determining their overall physical and mechanical properties, making them suitable for diverse applications. The dense and strong latewood contributes to their durability and structural stability, while the softer earlywood allows for some flexibility. This combination has significant implications on the workability of the wood, as the varied texture can pose challenges in processing and utilization. In comparison, white pines, with their less contrasted growth rings and more uniform texture, are easier to work with and often employed in applications requiring fine woodworking and detailed carving. However, they may not offer the same load-bearing capacity or resilience as hard pines do. In conclusion, the contrast seen in hard pines stems from the distinct differences in the earlywood and latewood within their growth rings. This contrast is characterized by variations in density, color, and texture, which significantly impact the wood's physical properties and its applications in various industries. While hard pines offer a combination of strength and flexibility owing to their contrasting growth patterns, this also presents additional challenges in terms of workability compared to species with a more uniform texture, such as white pines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"what unit of time can be estimated by the rings in a tree trunk?\\" is years. Tree rings, also known as growth rings or annual rings, are an essential tool for scientists and researchers in determining the age of trees, as well as understanding the climate and other environmental conditions. Each ring represents one complete year of growth for the tree. Examining the thickness and appearance of each ring can provide valuable information about the specific conditions present during that year of growth. Here's a brief explanation of why the other choices are not correct: - Hours: The growth of trees is not measured in hours as it is relatively insignificant in terms of time, and it would not be visible or meaningful within a tree's trunk. - Decades: While it is true that tree rings can age a tree and estimate the passage of decades, the rings are formed annually, making them a more accurate representation of years. - Months: Trees' growth rates change throughout the year because of external factors like temperature and precipitation. Tree rings are the accumulation of growth for an entire year, not monthly growth intervals. - H20: H2O represents water, which is not a unit of time at all. - Joules: Joules are a unit of energy, not time. - DNA: DNA plays a role in tree growth, but it is not a unit of time. Instead, it is a molecule containing genetic information. - Seasons: Although changes in the seasons do impact tree growth, rings develop annually rather than seasonally. Given the scientific evidence and comparison to the other answer choices, it is clear that the number of rings in a tree trunk represents the measurement of time in years."},{"prompt":"Aubrey filled Riley's tank with fuel to have a fun drive on the highway.

Try to keep children and other household pets away from the bird, but do talk to it frequently in a low, calming voice to help it get used to you. Remember that cockatiels are very social animals. You might leave music or the television on when you leave the house during the day so the cockatiel has something to listen to. You should spend some time researching the best ways to train a cockatiel, but a great place to start is teaching the bird to be near you outside of the cage. Gently remove the bird from the cage and take it to a small room with a door, like a bathroom or large closet. Close the door so the bird does not escape, and let the bird go. Then sit near the bird and talk to it every once in a while as it adjusts to your presence. Eventually, you can work on training the bird to climb onto your finger. Training a cockatiel can take time, but your patience will pay be rewarded with a well-socialized, friendly companion. Cockatiels can be very dusty birds and need to be bathed every few days.

Spanish colonization begins in 1511 and progresses alongside the importation of slaves from Africa. 2. Late 19th century: Wars and US involvement lead to Cuba's independence in 1902, producing a period of political instability and socioeconomic changes. 3. Mid-20th century: Fidel Castro leads a successful revolution which establishes a communist government. As part of the Cold War, Cuba gets into a well-known conflict with the US, leading to a US embargo on Cuba. 4. Late 20th century: After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba experiences economic hardship but also begins some reforms. 5. Early 21st century: Fidel Castro falls ill and hands over power to his brother Raul, who starts further reforms. In very recent years, diplomatic relationships with the US began to improve after a long freeze, but some tension still remains. Throughout all of these stages, we see Cuba's interactions with various international forces such as Spain, the US, the Soviet Union, and other Latin American countries, reflecting the island's strategic importance and the influence of its political and economic systems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. But I can use this background: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. What is an answer for this question: Which region had fewer species inhabiting it? The answer is:","completion":"The Northern region of Italy had fewer species inhabiting it. The relationship between abiotic stress and biodiversity is crucial when understanding why one region would have fewer species inhabiting it than another. Abiotic stress refers to the negative impacts caused by non-biological, or abiotic, factors in an environment. These can include extreme temperatures, water scarcity, soil nutrient limitations, and other physical and chemical factors that can make an environment more challenging for organisms to thrive in. In the given scenario, the Northern region of Italy experiences a significant amount of abiotic stress. As a result, the biodiversity in this area is affected negatively. High levels of abiotic stress act as selective pressures on species, often allowing only the most resilient and adaptable organisms to persist. This leads to a reduced number of species in the region, as less hardy organisms struggle to survive and reproduce in the face of these environmental challenges. Conversely, the Southern region of Italy experiences minimal abiotic stress. In this scenario, the environment is more hospitable and conducive to the growth and reproduction of various species. Such conditions support a greater level of biodiversity because multiple organisms with diverse characteristics are able to prosper in the area. This means that there will be a larger number of species inhabiting the Southern region compared to the Northern region, where abiotic stress is more prevalent. Moreover, the presence of abiotic stress can also contribute to a higher number of endangered species in the affected region. As species face challenges in their environment, their populations may decline to the point where they become vulnerable to extinction. Consequently, the Northern region of Italy would not only have fewer species but also a higher likelihood of harboring endangered or threatened species. To summarize, the Northern region of Italy had fewer species inhabiting it due to the higher levels of abiotic stress experienced in this area. In contrast, the Southern region's lower levels of abiotic stress allowed it to support a greater variety of species, resulting in higher biodiversity. This relationship between abiotic stress and species diversity highlights the importance of understanding the environmental factors that contribute to the well-being of ecosystems and their various inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stir in the remaining lukewarm water.","completion":"Now that we have our ingredients ready, let's continue making crumpets! 1. Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture, and mix them together with a wooden spoon until they form a smooth batter. The batter should be thick, but not too stiff.

This is to let the yeast do its magic and make the batter rise and become bubbly. 3. After the resting time, gently stir the batter to get rid of extra air bubbles. Then mix in the baking soda and a pinch of salt. This will help the crumpets become fluffier and taste better. 4. Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over low heat. Lightly grease some round metal molds (like cookie cutters) and the pan. You can also use a special crumpet ring or even an empty and clean tuna can with the top and bottom removed. 5. Place the molds onto the pan and fill each one about ½ full with the batter. Let the crumpets cook for about 4 to 5 minutes, until the top surface is covered with little holes and the edges look set. 6. Carefully remove the molds using tongs. Flip the crumpets over and cook them for another 3 to 4 minutes on the other side, until they are golden brown. 7. Remove the crumpets from the pan, and let them cool on a wire rack. Repeat the process with the remaining batter. Yay! Now, you have delicious homemade crumpets! You can eat them with your favorite toppings like butter, jam, or honey, and enjoy your tasty treat.

By Associated Press and Helen Pow PUBLISHED: 19:12 EST, 11 April 2013 | UPDATED: 19:30 EST, 11 April 2013 Desperate man: Lauren Brown, 55, a former consultant for IBM, has been identified as the slain suspect who held four firefighters hostage for hours in his suburban Atlanta home A gunman who lured firefighters to his Georgia home with an emergency call, then held four of them hostage for hours before being shot to death was identified Thursday as a down-on-his-luck IBM consultant. Lauren Brown's life apparently reached a crisis this spring. With his power, cable and other utilities cut off because of nonpayment, the 55-year-old had half a dozen guns in his house and spent weeks planning the kidnapping, targeting firefighters rather than police Wednesday so he wouldn't be shot, authorities said. Ambulance: An EMT works in the back of an ambulance as it leaves an Suwanee,","completion":"Georgia neighborhood where the hostage situation took place. The incident began when Brown made a 911 call, reporting a heart attack and pretending to be in severe distress. Firefighters from Station 10 in Gwinnett County quickly responded to the call, completely unaware that they were walking into a dangerous and unanticipated situation. Upon arrival, the firefighters were taken hostage by Brown, who demanded that his utility services be restored. According to investigators, Brown had lost his job at IBM and was struggling financially, unable to pay his bills and rapidly spiraling into an unstable state. The ordeal not only highlights Brown's personal tragedy but also reveals a concerning trend of increasing desperation among many Americans in the face of economic hardship. Neighbors, who had grown increasingly worried about Brown's erratic behavior, recall seeing a steady downturn in his life in recent months. Some described him as a once-friendly man who gradually became isolated and distressed. As his situation worsened, Brown's mental health seemed to deteriorate, and his focus shifted to finding a way to reverse the course of his life. Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway spoke to reporters during a press conference Thursday, giving a detailed account of the tragic incident and the coordinated efforts of law enforcement and the fire department to resolve it. According to Conway, a SWAT team was deployed to the scene in an attempt to negotiate with Brown and secure the release of the hostages. Standoff: Police officers and firemen worked together in a joint task force to handle the potentially deadly situation. After several hours of tense negotiations, the SWAT team was forced to take drastic action when Brown stopped communicating with them. Fearing for the lives of the hostages, authorities made the harrowing decision to storm the house. In the ensuing chaos, a hail of gunfire erupted as SWAT officers entered the residence. Brown was fatally wounded and later pronounced dead at the scene. All four firefighters were successfully rescued, but one suffered a gunshot wound to the hand. Thankfully, his injuries are not life-threatening, and he is expected to make a full recovery. Aftermath: The suburban Atlanta neighborhood where the hostage crisis took place returned to a sense of normalcy as the investigation continues. Brown's violent actions have left the local community shocked and saddened. The incident will undoubtedly leave lasting physical and psychological scars on those involved and will also prompt deeper discussions about societal and economic pressures driving people like Brown to such desperate and dangerous acts. Community response: In the days that followed, Atlanta residents came together to show their support for the first responders and the emotional ordeal they had experienced. Vigils, fundraisers, and tributes were organized to honor their bravery and provide emotional and financial assistance to those affected by the hostage crisis. As questions about Brown's motivations and the societal factors that contributed to his actions linger, the community can take solace in the fact that their first responders did everything in their power to protect and serve under challenging circumstances. However, the incident serves as a stark reminder that more needs to be done to address the growing desperation faced by many Americans, which can sometimes lead to dangerous and unforeseeable consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many important biochemical reactions, such as energy generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm. How does electron transit occur in bacteria?","completion":"Electron transit, or more commonly known as electron transport, occurs in bacteria primarily across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. This transit is facilitated by the fact that there is a general lack of internal membranes in bacteria, so all major biochemical reactions occur across the cell membrane itself. This is used for crucial processes like energy generation, which involve concentration gradients. In the specific case of electron transport, it is part of the metabolic process wherein cells capture and store energy. How it works is that electrons are passed along a chain of proteins and other molecules in a process of redox reactions, going from one molecule to another. This eventually leads to the creation of an electrochemical gradient, which is used to synthesize ATP, the primary energy currency of cells. The structure and processes within the bacteria cell membrane allow for this electron transit to occur efficiently. For example, in photosynthetic bacteria, the plasma membrane is highly folded, filling most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membranes which can enhance the efficiency of these energy-generating reactions. These can even form lipid-enclosed structures known as chlorosomes, particularly in green sulfur bacteria. These chlorosomes aid further in maximizing the efficiency of light absorption and therefore, energy generation. On top of this, there are also other membrane proteins present that carry out other functions crucial to the cell's survival. For instance, some proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, while others expel unneeded or harmful molecules from the cytoplasm, protecting the cell’s internal environment and ensuring its overall function and health. Overall, electron transit in bacteria takes place across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and periplasmic space, facilitating critical energy generation and other processes necessary for survival and function. This is made possible by the unique structure of bacterial cell membranes and the variety of proteins they host."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Montgomery County is part of the Metropolitan Statistical Area Blacksburg -- Christiansburg -- Christiansburg -- Radford , VA .","completion":"While both sentences attempt to convey that Montgomery County is within the Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford, VA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), there are minor differences in their presentation. The underlying meaning of the two sentences is essentially the same, as they point out Montgomery County's inclusion in a specific MSA. Here's a breakdown of the meaning within each sentence: 1. \\"Montgomery County is part of the Blacksburg -- Christiansburg -- Radford, VA Metropolitan Statistical Area.\\" This sentence states that Montgomery County is a constituent of the larger Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford MSA in Virginia. The MSA is a geographical region with a relatively high population density and substantial economic activity that extends beyond the boundaries of Montgomery County. The use of \\"--\\" separates the names of the three main locales within the MSA for easier reading. 2. \\"Montgomery County is part of the Metropolitan Statistical Area Blacksburg -- Christiansburg -- Christiansburg -- Radford, VA.\\" The intended meaning of this sentence is also to highlight Montgomery County's inclusion in the Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford MSA. However, there is an error in the sentence due to the repetition of the word \\"Christiansburg.\\" The placement of \\"Metropolitan Statistical Area\\" before the list of locations also makes the sentence structure slightly less clear when compared to the first sentence. Despite the minor differences in structure and a repetition error in the second sentence, the overall meaning of these sentences remains the same – Montgomery County is a part of the Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford, VA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.Façades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as \\"either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island\\". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island.

Information: - Forage fish, also called prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right. - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is... - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals. - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\"). - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats. - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances. - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems. - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates. - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals. - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin. - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing. - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\" a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish). - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century. - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder. - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.

However, the fact that \\"the woman is wearing a hot pink blouse\\" contradicts the information given in the initial statement. This indicates that the woman is not wearing a matching black shirt, as she is wearing a hot pink blouse instead. To reach the conclusion that \\"A tall man and short woman shake hands while wearing matching black shirts and yellow IDs,\\" we would need information supporting the idea that both individuals are wearing black shirts and yellow IDs. The information at hand, however, provides contradictory evidence regarding the woman's clothing. Therefore, given the current information, we cannot conclude that a tall man and short woman shake hands while wearing matching black shirts and yellow IDs, as the statement about the woman's hot pink blouse directly contradicts the idea of matching black shirts. Instead, we may be able to conclude that \\"A tall man and a short woman, wearing a hot pink blouse, shake hands while wearing yellow IDs,\\" as this statement incorporates the provided information regarding the woman's blouse and the yellow IDs, but does not assume that their shirts are matching in color."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Daniel Irvin Rather, Jr. was born on October 31, 1931, in Wharton County, Texas, the son of Daniel Irvin Rather, Sr., a ditch digger, and the former Byrl Veda Page. The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian. On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times. Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them. On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\"Memogate\\" and \\"Rathergate.\\" Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Many believe Rather's retirement was hastened by this incident. On September 20, 2007, Rather was interviewed on Larry King Live commenting \\"Nobody has proved that they were fraudulent, much less a forgery. ... The truth of this story stands up to this day.\\" What year were the memos released?","completion":"The memos were released on September 8, 2004. In the article, it states: \\"On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W.

From the following options, what is the question \\"What comic strip sometimes features a mailman named Beasley ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"What comic strip sometimes features a mailman named Beasley?\\" is primarily about identifying a specific comic strip. This question has different components to consider: - The primary subject of the question is a comic strip, suggesting that a potential response should be the name of a comic strip. - This comic strip is not just any comic strip, but one that occasionally includes a postman named Beasley. As such, a correct response would not only need to identify a comic strip but also demonstrate knowledge of its characters and recurring or occasional themes. - Beasley is specified to be a postman. By including this profession, the question might be hinting towards the thematic elements of the comic strip or the environment in which it takes place. Beasley could be a significant character in this comic strip or maybe a secondary or occasional character who has a certain relation to the main plot. The question does not give any other information about the art style or content theme of the comic strip, or when and where it was published. So, responses would need to satisfy all these conditions - being a comic strip and having a (likely recurring or notable) character who is a postman named Beasley. In conclusion, this question is seeking to identify a particular comic strip based on the detail of it featuring a mailman character named Beasley.

Passage: Bankruptcy On July 13, 2015, Jackson filed for Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut with a debt of 32,509,549.91. On July 17, 2015, the Court issued an order allowing a creditor to proceed with the punitive damages phase of a trial against Jackson in a New York state court, in connection with the alleged release of a private video. His assets were listed as between 10 million and 50 million in his bankruptcy petition, though he testified under oath that he is worth 4.4 million. Citing between 10 million and 50 million in debt, and the same amount in assets. Later in the week, Jacksons bankruptcy lawyers elucidated the court documents that legal fees and judgments exceeding 20 million over the past year were the primary cause of the filing. His filings listed 32 entities that he has a stake in. The bankruptcy came days after a jury ordered him to pay 5 million to rapper Rick Rosss ex-girlfriend Lastonia Leviston for invading her privacy by posting online a sex tape of her and another man. In addition, Jackson lost a dispute over a failed business deal to come to fruition to his Sleek headphones, where Jackson invested more than 2 million. An ex-partner accused Jackson of later stealing the design of the \\"Sleek by 50\\" headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than 17.2 million. His Connecticut bankruptcy filing states that he owns seven cars valued at more than 500,000, including a 2010 Rolls Royce and a 1966 Chevrolet Coupe. His expenses of 108,000 a month include 5,000 for gardening along with a monthly income of 185,000, mainly from royalties and income from his external businesses and investments. The court filing says he also owes money to his stylist, his barber and his fitness coach. Other details in the bankruptcy documents included information about two deals that sold the right to collect royalties of on-air play of his music. Half the rights to his portfolio were sold to the British independent music publishing company Kobalt Music Group for 3 million and the other half for another 3 million with the sales of his albums allowing Jackson to own 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings while paying only for distribution. Zeisler & Zeisler, a Bridgeport law firm, represented 50 Cent in the bankruptcy, which later resulted in Jackson filing a 75 million lawsuit against his own lawyers. He stated that his lawyers did a terrible job of representing him, specifically citing the fallout of his failed venture with Sleek Audio headphones and accused Garvey Schubert Barer, a Wall Street law firm of failing to \\"employ the requisite knowledge and skill necessary to confront the circumstances of the case.\\".","completion":"Task: Create complex questions from the given passage that involve numerical reasoning and various answer types (spans, numbers, dates). Question 1: How much more does Jackson's income from royalties and external businesses exceed his 108,000 monthly expenses? Answer Type: Number Explanation: Jackson's monthly income is mentioned to be 185,000 from royalties and external businesses. His monthly expenses are listed as 108,000. Hence, we need to subtract 108,000 from 185,000 to find out the difference. 185,000 - 108,000 = 77,000 Question 2: What was the combined cost for Jackson for the Sleek headphones dispute and the invasion of privacy case for Lastonia Leviston? Answer Type: Number Explanation: Jackson was ordered to pay 5 million to Leviston for invading her privacy. Additionally, he had to pay more than 17.2 million in the Sleek headphones dispute. We need to add both the amounts to get the combined cost. 5,000,000 + 17,200,000 = 22,200,000 Question 3: How much did Jackson receive in total by selling half of the rights to his music portfolio to Kobalt Music Group and the other half for owning 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings? Answer Type: Number Explanation: Jackson sold half of the rights to his music portfolio to Kobalt Music Group for 3 million and the other half for another 3 million. We need to add both amounts to get the total he received. 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 6,000,000 Question 4: How much in debt did Jackson file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and how much money did he claim to owe his stylist, barber, and fitness coach by 2015?
